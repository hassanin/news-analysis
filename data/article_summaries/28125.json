In this statement, the Trump administration expresses their desire for peace between Israelis and Palestinians, which they claim has remained unchanged for 50 years. They do not believe that the existence of settlements is an obstacle to peace, but they suggest that the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing ones beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving peace. The administration has not taken an official position on settlement activity and looks forward to discussing the issue further with Prime Minister Netanyahu during his visit with President Trump later in the month.
