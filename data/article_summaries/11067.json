First Lady Michelle Obama will be delivering commencement addresses at Dillard University, high schools in the Topeka, Kansas Public School District, and the District of Columbia College Access Program (DC-CAP). These institutions are supporting the First Lady's higher education initiative and working towards increasing the proportion of college graduates in America by 2020. Dillard University was chosen for its legacy as a historically black university, while the high schools in Topeka, Kansas are significant because of the Brown v. Board of Education case, which is celebrating its 60th anniversary. The DC College Access Program (DC-CAP) graduation celebration will highlight the program's efforts in assisting first-generation, low-income students in pursuing higher education. The commencement addresses will be open to the press, but space is limited. Michelle Obama has previously given commencement addresses at various universities and high schools across the United States.
