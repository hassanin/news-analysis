The Biden-Harris Administration has released a Migration Strategy, which is the first U.S. government strategy aimed at managing safe, orderly, and humane migration in North and Central America. The strategy focuses on improving regional cooperation, expanding protection, and enhancing access to lawful pathways for migration. It emphasizes the belief that individuals should be able to find safety and a dignified life in their own countries, but when that is not possible, asylum and legal migration pathways should be available. The United States has national security, economic, and humanitarian interests in promoting safe migration and aims to build a more stable region, strengthen legal pathways, and reduce irregular migration. The strategy will integrate various U.S. government tools and rely on partnerships with governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector to achieve its goals.
