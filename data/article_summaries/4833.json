The article highlights that the private sector in the US has recovered all the jobs lost during the pandemic and has even added more jobs. This is considered the fastest and strongest jobs recovery in American history. The article credits the decisive actions taken by the current Administration to fix the COVID response and pass the American Rescue Plan for getting the economy back on track. The second quarter of this year saw the creation of more jobs than any quarter in the past 40 years before the pandemic. The private sector currently has more Americans employed than during any day of the previous administration. The article suggests that the strong job market positions the US economy well to address global economic challenges such as inflation and the fallout from conflicts like Putin's war. The article emphasizes that America is better positioned than any other country to tackle inflation while preserving the economic gains of the past 18 months. Although additional job growth may be slower from this strong position, it is seen as a positive development as it signifies stable growth for the future. The article concludes by stating that passing legislation to lower costs for families, reduce the federal budget deficit, and promote innovation through the Bipartisan Innovation Act would help achieve stable growth in the years ahead.
