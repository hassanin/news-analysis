President Donald Trump has issued a Presidential Memorandum regarding the immigration status of Liberian nationals residing in the United States. Since 1991, certain Liberian nationals have been eligible for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or Deferred Enforced Departure (DED), which allows them to stay in the US despite being removable. In March 2018, it was determined that the conditions in Liberia had improved and did not warrant a further extension of DED, but a 12-month wind-down period was granted. However, upon further review, it has been decided to extend the wind-down period for an additional 12 months, until March 30, 2020. This decision is based on the foreign policy interests of the United States and the importance of Liberia as a regional partner. The reintegration of DED beneficiaries into Liberian civil and political life is seen as a complex task that, if unsuccessful, could strain US-Liberian relations and undermine Liberia's progress towards democracy. The extension of the wind-down period will preserve the current situation while Congress considers legislation to provide relief for Liberian DED beneficiaries. The memorandum also outlines the termination of DED for all Liberian beneficiaries on March 31, 2020, and the continued authorization for employment until March 30, 2020, for current beneficiaries who meet certain criteria. The Secretary of Homeland Security is directed to take appropriate measures to implement these actions.
