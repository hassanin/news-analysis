Vice President Kamala Harris convened a meeting with Indo-Pacific leaders on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders Meeting in Bangkok, Thailand. The meeting included Prime Minister Kishida of Japan, Prime Minister Han of the Republic of Korea, Prime Minister Albanese of Australia, Prime Minister Ardern of New Zealand, and Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada. They gathered to discuss the recent test of a long-range ballistic missile by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The leaders condemned the launch as a violation of multiple UN Security Council (UNSC) Resolutions and called on all UN Member States to fully implement these resolutions. They emphasized that a nuclear test by the DPRK would be met with a strong response from the international community. The leaders also reiterated that the door for dialogue with the DPRK remains open and urged them to cease unnecessary provocations and engage in serious diplomacy.
