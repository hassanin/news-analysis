President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring July 27, 2015, as National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day. The proclamation honors the sacrifices made by American troops during the Korean War and reaffirms the commitment to the security of the Republic of Korea. The Korean War, which began in 1950, saw nearly 1.8 million Americans fighting against Communist armies. Many soldiers endured brutal combat, POW camps, and 37,000 lost their lives. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of supporting and caring for veterans and fulfilling obligations to fallen heroes and their families. It also highlights the success of South Korea as a thriving democracy and ally of the United States. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor Korean War veterans.
