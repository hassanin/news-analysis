The Trump Administration commends the House of Representatives for passing the Conference Report to accompany H.R. 5515, the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019. The report supports the President's request for a pay raise for troops and aims to rebuild the military to deter adversaries. It also aligns with the Administration's commitment to maintaining a strong manufacturing and defense industrial base. The NDAA enhances the President's ability to defend the nation by supporting key components of the Administration's National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy. It also supports the Administration's Nuclear Posture Review, South Asia Strategy, vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, and ongoing operations against ISIS. The authorization levels for base national defense funding and Overseas Contingency Operations funding in the report are consistent with the levels requested in the President's Budget for FY 2019. The NDAA also supports Israel by authorizing the co-development and co-production of missile defense systems. It strengthens the posture of the United States in Europe and supports European allies against Russian aggression through the European Deterrence Initiative. The report also includes the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA), which aims to protect national security and maintain an open investment policy. Additionally, it recognizes the wrongful detainment of Andrew Brunson and Serkan Golge.
