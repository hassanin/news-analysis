Vice President Biden and Small Business Administration Administrator Karen Mills spoke at Wrap Tite, Inc. in Ohio to discuss the importance of passing the American Jobs Act and announced commitments by 13 private lenders to increase lending for small businesses by $20 billion over the next three years. This will help small businesses like Wrap Tite access the capital they need to grow and hire more workers. The American Jobs Act also includes significant tax cuts for small businesses, including a payroll tax cut and tax credits for hiring unemployed veterans or long-term unemployed workers. Vice President Biden emphasized that passing the American Jobs Act is about choosing to prioritize job creation over preserving tax loopholes for corporations and the wealthy. The Small Business Administration offers government guarantees on loans to small businesses made by private lenders, and in Fiscal Year 2011, they supported over $28 billion in small business lending. The financial institutions represented at the announcement include Wells Fargo, Key Corp, Regions Financial Corporation, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, M&T Bank Corporation, JP Morgan Chase & Company, Citizens Financial Group, Inc., Citigroup, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, TD Bank, US Bank, PNC Bank NA, and Sun Trust Banks, Inc.
