President Obama will be visiting Australia on November 16-17 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the U.S.-Australia alliance. The ANZUS alliance is crucial for the security of the Asia-Pacific region, and Australia is one of the United States' closest allies. This visit will follow the APEC Leaders Meeting in Hawaii and will allow the two leaders to further discuss and expand bilateral cooperation in areas such as global economic growth, trade, and job creation. The President will also consult with the Prime Minister on global and regional issues in preparation for the East Asia Summit in Bali, Indonesia.
