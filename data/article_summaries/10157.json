President Obama thanks the Senate for confirming Nina Pillard as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. This confirmation brings the total number of active female judges on the bench to five, a first for the court. Pillard has a strong track record of championing justice and integrity, with notable achievements including defending the constitutionality of the Family and Medical Leave Act and advocating for female students to be admitted to the Virginia Military Institute. The President is confident that Pillard will be a diligent and thoughtful addition to the D.C. Circuit.
