On November 29, 2011, the President signed two laws. The first law, H.R. 3321, known as the "America's Cup Act of 2011," allows certain competing and supporting vessels to participate in the 34th America's Cup in the United States, even if they would be prohibited by Federal coastwise trade laws. The law also waives or clarifies the application of Federal coastwise trade laws for seven named vessels. 

The second law, S. 1637, known as the "Appeal Time Clarification Act of 2011," clarifies that in any civil action where a current or former Federal officer or employee is sued individually for an act or omission related to their duties on behalf of the United States, the time to appeal for all parties involved is set at 60 days.
