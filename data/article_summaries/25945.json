President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation on November 27, 2019, in honor of World AIDS Day. The proclamation recognizes the support for individuals living with HIV and AIDS and remembers those who have lost their lives to the disease. It acknowledges the advancements in medical care, treatment, acceptance, and understanding of the virus, but emphasizes the need for continued efforts to find a vaccine and cure. The proclamation states that approximately 1.1 million people in the United States and 38 million worldwide are living with HIV. It highlights the availability of antiretroviral therapy, making HIV a manageable chronic condition rather than a fatal diagnosis. The proclamation mentions the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and syringe services programs as interventions to prevent new HIV transmissions. President Trump's administration launched the initiative "Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America" to eliminate at least 90 percent of new HIV infections in the United States within 10 years. The initiative focuses on diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and response, and involves various agencies. The proclamation also highlights the United States' leadership in the global response to HIV/AIDS through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which has invested over $85 billion in the global HIV/AIDS response. PEPFAR's work in more than 50 countries has saved lives, prevented new infections, and moved towards controlling the pandemic. The proclamation calls for collaboration and compassion to address the stigma and disparities faced by people living with HIV. President Trump proclaims December 1, 2019, as World AIDS Day and urges all Americans to remember those who have lost their lives to AIDS and provide support and compassion to those living with HIV.
