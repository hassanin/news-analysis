In a statement by White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer, it is mentioned that President Obama has concerns about certain provisions in the Republican agreement on the omnibus. These provisions include undermining Wall Street reforms, enacting extreme social and ideological riders, undercutting environmental protections, and threatening the foreign policy prerogatives of the President. Pfeiffer suggests that Congress should pass a short-term continuing resolution, as it has done seven times already that year, to allow all parties to consider and complete the critical budget and economic issues necessary to finish the year.
