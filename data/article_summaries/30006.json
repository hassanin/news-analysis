President Donald J. Trump's next major priority is to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs and protect patients with preexisting conditions. He is expanding Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs), which will provide new coverage options for American workers. This expansion aims to address the high costs and complexity of health insurance that many businesses have struggled with, leading to less coverage and fewer options for workers. President Trump is focused on delivering more health coverage options and lowering healthcare costs for Americans.
