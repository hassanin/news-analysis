On October 31, 2017, President Donald Trump issued a statement declaring the national emergency with respect to Sudan. This emergency was originally declared in 1997 due to the actions and policies of the Sudanese government posing a threat to US national security and foreign policy. Over the years, this emergency has been expanded and additional steps have been taken to address the crisis, particularly in the Darfur region. While positive efforts by the Sudanese government between July 2016 and January 2017 led to the revocation of certain executive orders, the crisis has not been fully resolved. Therefore, President Trump has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in 1997. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
