President Obama has declared major disasters in the states of Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Missouri due to severe winter storms and flooding. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The funding will be used for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will be coordinating the recovery operations. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
