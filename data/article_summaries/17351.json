The White House Press Secretary released a statement expressing the President's support for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) of 2013. The President welcomes the bipartisan approval of the bill by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. The President has long supported an inclusive ENDA, which aims to protect against employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The statement encourages the full Senate's consideration of ENDA and urges the House to take action on the bill to uphold fairness and equality.
