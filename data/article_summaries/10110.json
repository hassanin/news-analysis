In this memorandum, President Barack Obama announces the withdrawal of the Bristol Bay area of the North Aleutian Basin in Alaska from leasing for oil or gas development until June 30, 2017. This decision prohibits any consideration of Bristol Bay for leasing purposes, whether for exploration or production of oil and gas. Existing leases in this area are not affected by the withdrawal. The authority for this action comes from section 12(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.
