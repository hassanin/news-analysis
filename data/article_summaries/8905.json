President Biden has declared a major disaster for the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians and authorized federal aid to support their efforts in areas affected by Tropical Storm Hilary in August 2023. The federal funding will be available to the tribe and certain nonprofit organizations for emergency work, facility repairs, and replacements on a cost-sharing basis. Additionally, funding for hazard mitigation measures will also be available. Mr. Andrew F. Grant from FEMA has been appointed to coordinate federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Further designations may be made in the future based on damage assessments. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
