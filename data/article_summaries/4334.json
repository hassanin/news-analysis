In a press call, senior administration officials announced that President Biden will take steps to end the country's failed approach to marijuana. The President will pardon all prior federal offenses of simple marijuana possession, including those under District of Columbia law. This pardon will help relieve the collateral consequences faced by thousands of individuals, such as denial of housing, employment, or educational opportunities. The President has also urged governors to do the same with regard to state offenses of simple possession. Additionally, the President has asked the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General to review how marijuana is scheduled under federal law, which currently classifies it as a Schedule I controlled substance. The President emphasized the importance of maintaining limitations on trafficking, marketing, and underage sales even as marijuana laws change. The officials estimated that over 6,500 people with prior federal convictions and thousands more under D.C. law could benefit from the pardons. The timing of the action is a result of the President's commitment to addressing the country's failed marijuana laws. The de-scheduling process will be based on a careful review of scientific and medical evidence and will proceed expeditiously. The officials clarified that the pardon applies to anyone who has committed the offense of simple possession of marijuana, even if they have not been charged or convicted. The President's announcement was made through a video statement to ensure broad dissemination of the news.
