The article discusses First Lady Michelle Obama's participation in the annual NORAD Tracks Santa program, where she answered calls from children across the country asking about Santa's location. This is Mrs. Obama's fourth year participating in the Christmas Eve tradition. The NORAD Tracks Santa program began in 1955 after a misprinted telephone number in a local newspaper led a child to call the Continental Air Defense Command Operations Center. The commander on duty gave the child the requested information about Santa's whereabouts, starting the tradition of tracking Santa. The program has since grown, with millions of visitors to the website and over 1,200 volunteers who handle phone calls and emails from families around the world.
