The Biden-Harris Administration is establishing the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (OPPR) as a permanent office in the Executive Office of the President. This office will be responsible for leading, coordinating, and implementing actions related to preparedness and response to biological threats or pathogens that could lead to a pandemic or public health disruptions in the United States. Major General (ret) Paul Friedrichs has been appointed as the inaugural Director of OPPR and Principal Advisor on Pandemic Preparedness and Response. He currently serves as the Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Global Health Security and Biodefense at the National Security Council. The OPPR will coordinate the domestic response to public health threats, drive federal science and technology efforts for pandemic preparedness, and provide periodic reports to Congress. Major General Friedrichs brings extensive experience in healthcare and public health and has worked closely with various government partners and international allies throughout his career.
