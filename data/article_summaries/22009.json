The White House is deeply disturbed by the images of Ukrainian security forces shooting at their own citizens. They are calling on President Yanukovych to immediately remove his security forces from downtown Kyiv and respect the right to peaceful protest. They are also urging protesters to remain peaceful and not engage in violence. The United States is urging the Ukrainian military to refrain from getting involved and emphasizing that the crisis should be resolved through political means. The statement emphasizes that the use of force will not solve the crisis and that steps must be taken to stop the violence and initiate meaningful dialogue to address the grievances of the Ukrainian people. The United States, along with European allies, is committed to holding those responsible for the violence accountable and assisting the Ukrainian people in achieving a unified and independent Ukraine for a better future.
