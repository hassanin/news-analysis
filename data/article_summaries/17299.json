In this statement, the President expresses his satisfaction with the passage of the Veterans Skills to Jobs Act, which aims to make it easier for veterans to find employment. The legislation is seen as a complement to a new partnership launched by the Administration to help manufacturing companies hire returning servicemembers with the necessary skills. The President highlights other steps taken by his Administration, such as providing tax credits for businesses hiring veterans, the Joining Forces initiative that has helped veterans and military spouses find jobs, and the development of online tools to connect veterans with employers. However, the President emphasizes that more needs to be done, including the passage of legislation creating a Veterans Job Corps, and ongoing efforts to ensure that veterans have opportunities to succeed after their service.
