The United States and the Republic of Korea (ROK) have launched the inaugural meeting of the Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG), in line with the April 2023 Washington Declaration and the decision by President Biden and President Yoon Suk Yeol. The NCG will strengthen the U.S.-ROK Alliance and enhance their deterrence and response capabilities. The meeting affirmed the U.S. commitment to providing extended deterrence to the ROK, including nuclear capabilities, and emphasized that any nuclear attack by North Korea against the U.S. or its allies is unacceptable. The NCG will play a crucial role in discussing and advancing bilateral approaches to nuclear and strategic planning. Workstreams were established to enhance nuclear deterrence and response capabilities, including security protocols, consultation processes, coordination of planning and operations, and joint support to U.S. nuclear operations. Both sides committed to executing these efforts promptly and reporting progress to their respective presidents. The NCG will meet quarterly, with the next principal-level meeting scheduled to take place in the United States later this year.
