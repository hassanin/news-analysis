Dr. Jill Biden, a teacher for almost three decades and a community-college instructor for the past 16 years, writes an essay in The Chronicle of Higher Education discussing the importance of community colleges and the Obama-Biden administration's commitment to improving them. She highlights the passage of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which includes significant new federal investments in higher education, particularly for community colleges. This legislation stabilizes Pell Grants and ensures that grants will increase with inflation, providing financial aid to community-college students. The essay also mentions the expanded Opportunity Tax Credit, income-based repayment of student loans, and $2 billion allocated for developing and improving educational and training programs at community colleges. Dr. Biden announces that she will be leading a national summit on community colleges in the fall, bringing together college presidents, instructors, business leaders, and other stakeholders to share best practices and generate policy ideas for student success. She emphasizes the power of community colleges to change lives, serve as a gateway to a baccalaureate degree, and offer job-certification programs for laid-off workers. Dr. Biden calls for continued partnership to support and improve community colleges, stating that their work has just begun.
