The Biden-Harris Administration has announced new actions to advance global health security in response to ongoing outbreaks such as the Mpox outbreak and Ebola outbreak. The Administration aims to protect American lives and livelihoods by implementing the National Biodefense Strategy and partnering with countries to strengthen their health systems. The United States will directly support at least 50 countries by 2025 to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. They will provide over $1.25 billion in funding for Fiscal Year 2022 and encourage other donors and multilateral partners to contribute. Additionally, the United States will invest in pandemic preparedness domestically and in the Western Hemisphere. The Administration urges Congress to provide the necessary resources to sustain progress in global health security partnerships. They have also released an annual report highlighting the outcomes of partner country activities in Fiscal Year 2021 to demonstrate the impact of their investments.
