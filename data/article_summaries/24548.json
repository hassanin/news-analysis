President Obama will designate the first marine national monument in the Atlantic Ocean, called the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument. This monument will protect 4,913 square miles of marine ecosystems off the coast of New England, including deep-sea coral and endangered whales and sea turtles. The designation reflects President Obama's commitment to combat climate change and protect the ocean. The monument will be jointly managed by the Department of Commerce and the Department of the Interior. The boundaries of the monument have been tailored based on scientific research and stakeholder input. Recreational fishing will be allowed within the monument, and commercial fishing operators will have a transition period before being required to change their practices. The Administration will also work to address the economic impacts on northeast fisheries and explore opportunities to advance ocean and fisheries management in response to climate shifts. President Obama has prioritized marine conservation throughout his presidency, protecting more land and water than any administration in history.
