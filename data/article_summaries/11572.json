In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims March 2014 as National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, claiming over 50,000 lives each year. The article emphasizes the importance of early detection and raising public awareness of risk factors and screening recommendations. The risk of developing colorectal cancer increases with age, particularly for those over 50 years old and individuals of African-American or Eastern European descent, as well as those with inflammatory bowel disease or a family history of colorectal cancer. Symptoms can include stomach pain, aches, cramps, and unexplained weight loss. Regular screenings between the ages of 50 and 75 are crucial for early detection and prevention. The administration is funding research to improve prevention and treatment and ensure screenings and treatment are available and affordable for all. The Affordable Care Act ensures that most health insurance plans cover recommended preventive services, including colorectal cancer screening, at no out-of-pocket cost. The article encourages Americans to discuss colorectal cancer with their doctors and urges everyone to look out for at-risk family members and friends and encourage them to get screened. The proclamation calls on citizens, government agencies, private businesses, non-profit organizations, and other groups to participate in activities that increase awareness and prevention of colorectal cancer.
