In this article, President Donald Trump proclaims January 20 to January 26, 2019, as National School Choice Week. He emphasizes the importance of providing all students with the opportunity to pursue an education that best suits their learning style and prepares them for success in the future. Trump believes that the current education system falls short of meeting the needs of students and teachers, as evidenced by the United States' rankings in international surveys. He advocates for increased educational options, such as out-of-zone public schools, public charter schools, magnet schools, private schools, home schools, and online education programs. Trump highlights the increase in the number of students receiving D.C. Opportunity Scholarships and the improvement of 529 plans to cover elementary and secondary school tuition. He encourages families to explore new educational opportunities, educators to develop innovative pathways to learning, and students to pursue their goals and dreams with discipline and determination. Trump calls on lawmakers to embrace and expand education choice, as it will benefit students, families, educators, communities, and the nation as a whole.
