The U.S. government is taking steps to address the economic and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan and has previewed an executive order related to the disposition of Afghanistan's central bank reserves held in the United States. When Kabul fell to the Taliban, Afghanistan had over $9 billion in reserves, with $7 billion held in the U.S. and the rest in other countries. The U.S. has signed an executive order blocking the property of the Afghan central bank held in the U.S. and is seeking to transfer $3.5 billion for the benefit of the Afghan people. However, the transfer will depend on a court ruling and no funds will be transferred until then. The U.S. is also working on setting up a trust fund to administer the transferred funds. The U.S. is the first and only country to take steps to make Afghan reserves available for the benefit of the Afghan people. The U.S. government has been providing humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan separately, with over $500 million provided since August. The executive order is based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and the U.S. government has been consulting with international partners and allies on the matter. The U.S. recognizes the importance of addressing the needs of the Afghan people while also respecting ongoing efforts by victims of terrorism to pursue legal claims against the Taliban.
