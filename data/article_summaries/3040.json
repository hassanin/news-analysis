President Biden addressed the recent tragedy involving FBI special agents in Florida and expressed condolences to the families affected. He acknowledged the risks and sacrifices that law enforcement officers and military personnel make every day. The President then congratulated the new Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, and discussed his plans to strengthen the immigration system through executive orders. He emphasized that he is not creating new laws but rather reversing what he considers to be counterproductive policies from the previous administration. The executive orders aim to address issues such as family separations at the border, root causes of migration, and a comprehensive review of immigration policies. President Biden signed the orders and highlighted the importance of reuniting separated families and restoring the country's reputation as a haven for those in need.
