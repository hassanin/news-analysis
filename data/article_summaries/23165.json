This article discusses an executive order issued by President Barack Obama on January 16, 2016, regarding the revocation of certain executive orders and the provision of implementation authorities for aspects of certain statutory sanctions with respect to Iran. The executive order revokes Executive Orders 13574, 13590, 13622, and 13645, and amends Executive Order 13628. The revocation and amendment are in response to Iran's implementation of nuclear-related measures specified in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) between Iran and the P5+1 countries (China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States), the European Union, and Iran. The executive order provides implementation authorities for sanctions that are outside the scope of the U.S. commitments under the JCPOA. The order also includes provisions related to donations, prohibitions, entry into the United States, general authorities, evasion and conspiracy, definitions, notice, and the effect on actions or proceedings.
