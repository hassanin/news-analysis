National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan held a press call to preview President Biden's speech on the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Sullivan emphasized the importance of the visit to Ukraine and Poland, highlighting the need to support Ukraine and defend fundamental principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and democracy. He also mentioned the ongoing efforts to support Ukraine with military, economic, and humanitarian assistance. Sullivan stated that the President's speech would not be a direct response to Russian President Putin's speech but would focus on laying out an affirmative vision for the world and reiterating the brutality of Russia's war effort. He also mentioned that the speech would touch on energy issues, NATO force posture, and core democratic values. Sullivan emphasized that the President's remarks would not outline specific proposals for ending the war, as the United States believes in Ukraine's right to determine its own future.
