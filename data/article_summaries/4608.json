Bolden, Sr., Betty Jo Bogans, and Dexter Eugene Jackson. Abraham Bolden is an 86-year-old former U.S. Secret Service agent who was charged in 1964 with attempting to sell a Secret Service file. Betty Jo Bogans was convicted in 1998 of drug possession with intent to distribute, and Dexter Jackson was convicted in 2002 for facilitating the distribution of marijuana. The 75 individuals receiving commutations have been granted reduced sentences, with some being released from prison and others serving the remainder of their sentences in home confinement. These individuals were convicted of various drug-related offenses and have demonstrated good behavior and rehabilitation while in custody.
