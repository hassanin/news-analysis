The article discusses the response of the government to the Ninth Circuit's decision to uphold the district court's injunction on the government's actions to combat asylum abuse. The government expresses their disagreement with the decision but is pleased that the nationwide application of the injunction has been deemed improper. They state that although the injunction remains overbroad, they will now be able to enforce the rule outside of the Ninth Circuit. The government hopes that the injunction will be lifted entirely on appeal so that they can protect legitimate asylum seekers, allocate resources for their claims, and prevent illegal migrants from overwhelming the asylum system.
