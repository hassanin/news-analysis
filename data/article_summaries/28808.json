White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, held a press briefing on September 5, 2017, where she discussed President Trump's decision to phase out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Sanders argued that the program was implemented in violation of federal law and that President Trump's decision was the responsible and constitutional choice. She emphasized that DACA recipients were not a priority for deportation and that the administration is calling on Congress to pass legislation for a more permanent solution. Sanders also addressed questions about the President's stance on comprehensive immigration reform, negotiations with North Korea, and the President's personal involvement in crafting legislation.
