President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to significant transnational criminal organizations, which was declared in Executive Order 13581 on July 24, 2011, and further addressed in Executive Order 13863 on March 15, 2019, will continue beyond its anniversary date of July 24, 2022. The President emphasizes that these criminal organizations pose a serious threat to the stability of international political and economic systems, as they have grown increasingly sophisticated and dangerous, infiltrating foreign governments and the international financial system. They weaken democratic institutions, undermine the rule of law, and disrupt economic markets. Additionally, these organizations exacerbate violent conflicts and support other dangerous individuals. Given these ongoing threats to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States, President Biden has determined that it is necessary to extend the national emergency.
