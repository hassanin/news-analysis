During a press gaggle aboard Air Force One, White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, provided updates on several topics. First, President Obama was convening a call with his national security team to get an update on the investigation into the recent terror attacks in France. The Department of Homeland Security has stated that there is no specific threat related to the attack. The call also discussed the security measures in place to protect Americans both at home and abroad. The participants included senior officials from the FBI, Department of Justice, CIA, DNI, NCTC, and Department of Homeland Security. 

Second, President Obama called Senator Barbara Boxer to congratulate her on her retirement announcement. 

Third, Earnest discussed the nomination of U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch as the next Attorney General of the United States. He expressed concern that despite being nominated almost two months ago, a hearing date has not yet been set by the Senate. The White House is urging the Senate to schedule a hearing for Lynch as soon as possible, with the goal of confirming her before the Congress goes on their mid-February recess. 

During the press gaggle, Earnest also answered questions about the French investigation, Fannie and Freddie, community colleges, and other nominations. He also provided some statistics on the improvements made at the VA facility in Phoenix.
