In this statement, National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice welcomes the report by the United Nations mission investigating allegations of chemical weapons use in Syria. The report provides further evidence that sarin gas was used by the Syrian regime on a large scale on August 21 in the suburbs of Damascus. The UN team collected a wealth of evidence, including rockets, environmental samples, and biomedical samples, that tested positive for sarin. While the report does not assign blame, the technical evidence supports the conclusion that the Syrian regime was responsible for the attacks. The statement also acknowledges the hard work of Dr. Ake Sellstrom and his team who conducted the investigation. The talks in Geneva over the weekend developed a framework to eliminate Syrian chemical weapons in a transparent and verifiable manner, which would remove the threat these weapons pose. The United States will continue to work with other countries and organizations to ensure the process is verifiable and there are consequences if the Assad regime does not comply. If diplomacy fails, the US is prepared to take action.
