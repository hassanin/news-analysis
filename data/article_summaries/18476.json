First Lady Michelle Obama will be hosting the 2016 College Signing Day event in New York City on April 26th. More than 4,000 students from New York high schools will be attending the event, which is part of her Reach Higher initiative. The event will be hosted by MTV in collaboration with Viacom's Get Schooled initiative. This will be the third annual College Signing Day event hosted by the First Lady, with previous events taking place in Detroit, Michigan in 2015 and San Antonio, Texas in 2014. Over 500 College Signing Day events have been planned nationwide by various communities, students, and organizations. Education Secretary John B. King Jr. will attend a College Signing Day event in Washington, D.C. The First Lady's College Signing Day events are aimed at inspiring young people to pursue higher education. She also launched the Better Make Room campaign last October, which targets Generation Z and aims to celebrate education and provide resources for students to continue their education beyond high school.
