On December 17, 1903, Orville and Wilbur Wright achieved the first successful manned flight. This day, known as Wright Brothers Day, celebrates their historic accomplishment and the impact it had on modern transportation. The Wright brothers' achievement solidified their place in history as American icons and propelled the aviation industry into a new era. Their relentless pursuit of powered flight serves as an inspiration for future inventors and entrepreneurs. Just as the Wright brothers' breakthrough led to a new industry, a new generation of space pioneers is now following in their footsteps and working towards advancing the commercial space industry. To maintain America's technological leadership, it is important to empower the next generation through quality education in math and science and cultivate their entrepreneurial spirit. Wright Brothers Day, designated by Congress, is a reminder to prepare the next generation of innovators to create a promising future. President Barack Obama proclaimed December 17, 2010, as Wright Brothers Day.
