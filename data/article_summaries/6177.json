The recent cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline has prompted a comprehensive federal response to secure critical energy supply chains. President Biden is receiving regular briefings on the situation and has instructed federal agencies to use their resources to alleviate shortages in affected areas. The focus is on preventing energy supply disruptions for affected communities, the military, and facilities that rely on gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other refined petroleum products. The administration is continuously evaluating the impact of the pipeline shutdown on the U.S. fuel supply and considering additional measures to mitigate the consequences.
