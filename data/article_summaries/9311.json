This article discusses the implementation of a tariff-rate quota on imports of aluminum articles from the United Kingdom (UK) into the United States. The US Secretary of Commerce found that imports of aluminum articles from various countries, including the UK, were threatening the national security of the United States. As a result, President Biden decided to impose a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on aluminum articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. However, the US has successfully concluded discussions with the UK and agreed on alternative means to address the threat posed by aluminum imports. The US and the UK will expand coordination on trade remedies, monitor bilateral steel and aluminum trade, cooperate on addressing non-market excess capacity and carbon intensity, and review their arrangement annually. The US will implement a tariff-rate quota that limits the quantity of aluminum articles imported from the UK without the application of the tariff. Certain conditions and restrictions apply to eligible aluminum articles, and the US will monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the agreed-upon measures. The agreed-upon tariff-rate quota volume is consistent with the objective of sustaining a sufficient capacity utilization rate in the US aluminum industry. The current tariff level on aluminum articles from other countries will be maintained. The proclamation is authorized by section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974. The article includes specific details regarding the amendments to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States and the effective date of the modifications.
