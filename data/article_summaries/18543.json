President Obama has signed the Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014 into law. However, this does not indicate a change in the Administration's sanctions policy. The Administration does not currently plan to impose sanctions under this law, but the Act provides additional authorities that could be used if necessary. The Administration will continue to work with allies and partners to respond to developments in Ukraine and review and adjust sanctions in response to Russia's actions. The President calls on Russia to end its occupation and attempted annexation of Crimea, stop supporting separatists in eastern Ukraine, and fulfill its obligations under the Minsk agreements. The goal is to find a diplomatic solution that resolves the conflict and promotes stability in Ukraine and the region, including Russia. Sanctions may be lifted if Russia takes the necessary steps.
