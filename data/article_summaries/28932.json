The President's Commission on White House Fellows has announced the appointment of the 2018-2019 class of White House Fellows. The White House Fellowship, created in 1964, provides professionals from diverse backgrounds with the opportunity to engage in public service for one year by serving in various roles in the federal government. The program aims to give fellows first-hand experience with the workings of the federal government and increase their sense of participation in national affairs. Fellows participate in an education program that expands their knowledge of leadership, policy-making, and contemporary issues, and also engage in community service projects throughout the year. The selection process is highly competitive and based on professional accomplishment, leadership skills, potential for growth, and commitment to public service. The 2018-2019 class includes individuals from various backgrounds such as the military, law enforcement, healthcare, and entrepreneurship, among others.
