In this press briefing, Press Secretary Jay Carney responds to questions about a video that has caused controversy during the 2012 election campaign. The video in question shows Mitt Romney making comments about the 47 percent of Americans who he believes do not pay income taxes and are dependent on the government. Carney emphasizes that President Obama believes in representing all Americans, not just those who voted for him, and that his policies are focused on building and strengthening the middle class. Carney also addresses questions about the recent attacks in Libya and the administration's response. He explains that the investigation is ongoing and that the initial evidence suggests that the attacks were a reaction to a controversial video. Carney also discusses the suspension of training for new Afghan recruits due to the increase in "green-on-blue" attacks. He assures that the transition of security responsibility to Afghan forces will continue, but that the security measures are being reviewed to better protect American troops. The briefing also touches on topics such as oil prices, Middle East peace process, China, and the UN General Assembly.
