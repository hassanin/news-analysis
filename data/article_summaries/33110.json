This executive order, issued by President Donald Trump on July 21, 2017, emphasizes the importance of a healthy manufacturing and defense industrial base and resilient supply chains to the economic strength and national security of the United States. The order highlights the need for the United States to maintain a manufacturing and defense industrial base capable of manufacturing or supplying items critical to national security. It expresses concerns about the loss of American factories, key companies, and manufacturing jobs, and the potential negative impact on domestic capacity and capabilities for national defense. The order calls for a comprehensive evaluation of the defense industrial base and supply chains, to be conducted by the Secretary of Defense in coordination with other relevant departments and agencies. The evaluation should identify essential goods, manufacturing capabilities, potential contingencies that could disrupt supply chains, and assess the resiliency and capacity of the manufacturing and defense industrial base. It also calls for the identification of causes of deficiencies and the recommendation of legislative, regulatory, and policy changes to address these issues and strengthen the manufacturing capacity and defense industrial base. The order includes general provisions to ensure its implementation is consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
