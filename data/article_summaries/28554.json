President Trump issued a statement expressing his support for Chairman Grassley's immigration bill, which is based on the White House Framework. He urged senators to vote for the Grassley bill and oppose any legislation that violates the Framework's "four pillars." These pillars include finding a lasting solution for DACA, ending chain migration, canceling the visa lottery, and securing the border through building a wall and closing legal loopholes. The President asked senators from both parties to support the Grassley bill and reject any short-term solutions. He also mentioned his encouragement towards the House's efforts in advancing legislation that aligns with the four pillars. With the military fully funded, the President's focus is now on enacting responsible and commonsense immigration reform.
