The United States welcomes the agreements reached at the 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference to strengthen the global non-proliferation regime. The agreement includes steps to advance non-proliferation, nuclear disarmament, and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. It also reaffirms the agenda laid out by the President in Prague and emphasizes holding nations accountable for not abiding by their international obligations. The document includes an agreement to hold a regional conference in 2012 to discuss issues related to a Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction. The United States supports such a zone but believes that a comprehensive and durable peace in the region and full compliance with arms control and nonproliferation obligations are necessary. The US strongly opposes singling out Israel and actions that jeopardize its national security. The main threat to proliferation in the Middle East and the NPT is Iran's failure to fulfill its obligations. The efforts made in this agreement will strengthen the NPT and help ensure that all nations meet their obligations or face consequences. The goal is to create a world where nations can benefit from nuclear energy while being secure from the threat of nuclear proliferation.
