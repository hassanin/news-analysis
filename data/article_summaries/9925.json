Vice President Joe Biden will be traveling to Panama and Mexico in September to highlight the strong relationships the United States has in the region. Before visiting these countries, he will also be visiting the ports of Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, which are preparing to accommodate increased freight volumes from the Panama Canal expansion project. The project, set to be completed in 2015, will nearly triple the canal's capacity and allow larger ships to call on U.S. ports, creating new export markets and opportunities for U.S. businesses. In Panama, the Vice President will tour the canal expansion project and meet with President Martinelli to discuss improving integration in Central America for economic growth. In Mexico, he will launch the U.S.-Mexico High Level Economic Dialogue and participate in an education event highlighting the Bilateral Forum on Education, Innovation, and Research. He will also meet with President Pe√±a Nieto to strengthen the economic relationship between the two countries.
