This executive order, signed by President Barack Obama on October 16, 2014, orders the Selected Reserve and certain Individual Ready Reserve members of the Armed Forces to active duty. The order is made in order to augment the active Armed Forces of the United States for the effective conduct of Operation United Assistance, which is providing support to civilian-led humanitarian assistance and consequence management support related to the Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa. The order authorizes the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to order to active duty any units and individual members not assigned to a unit organized to serve as a unit of the Selected Reserve, or any member in the Individual Ready Reserve mobilization category designated as essential. The order does not create any right or benefit enforceable at law or in equity against the United States or its entities.
