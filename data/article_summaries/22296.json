The Obama Administration has announced that Columbus, OH is the winner of the Smart City Challenge. Columbus will receive up to $40 million from the Department of Transportation to prototype the future of transportation, including self-driving cars, smart traffic lights, and vehicle-to-vehicle communications. The challenge called on cities to come up with plans to reshape their transportation systems using technology, data, and creativity. Columbus plans to improve transportation options for residents, deploy self-driving shuttles, optimize traffic flow, test connected vehicle technology, address climate change, and create an integrated payment system for transportation. The other six finalist cities, Austin, Denver, Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Portland, and San Francisco, have also proposed innovative solutions to transportation challenges and will receive support to carry out their plans. Over 150 industry and non-profit partners have pledged more than $500 million in resources and technology solutions to help implement the Smart City plans.
