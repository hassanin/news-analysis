President Obama visited China in November 2014, and the two countries agreed to expand cooperation on various issues. They pledged to work together on addressing global challenges such as the Ebola epidemic, terrorism, and nonproliferation. They also committed to supporting Afghanistan's government and promoting peace and reconciliation in the country. The two leaders agreed to cooperate in stopping the trade of illegal wildlife products and announced the reciprocal extension of visa validity to facilitate travel between the US and China. Additionally, they agreed on military-to-military confidence-building mechanisms and to enhance law enforcement cooperation in areas such as repatriation, counterfeit goods, and fighting corruption.
