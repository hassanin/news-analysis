President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation ordering that the flag of the United States be flown at half-staff in honor of Nancy Reagan. The flag will be lowered at the White House, public buildings and grounds, military posts, naval stations, naval vessels, and all United States embassies and facilities abroad. This order will remain in effect until sunset on the day of Nancy Reagan's interment. The proclamation was issued on March 7, 2016, and is a mark of respect for the former First Lady.
