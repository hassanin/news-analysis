The Administration has issued a statement in support of the House passage of H.R. 3354, the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act, 2018. The bill provides appropriations for various departments and agencies including the interior and environment, agriculture and rural development, commerce, justice, science, financial services and general government, homeland security, labor, health and human services, education, state and foreign operations, and transportation, housing and urban development for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018. The Administration also appreciates the inclusion of the text of H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018, which provides critical funding for the military and includes the President's $1.6 billion border wall proposal. However, the Administration notes that current spending levels would result in a sequestration of $72.4 billion in the defense category and urges the House and Senate to enact the $57.3 billion in savings included in the FY 2018 Budget request to avoid sequestration. The Administration also shares additional views regarding specific provisions in the bill related to various departments and agencies.
