This article is a presidential memorandum issued by President Barack Obama in September 2010. It directs the Secretary of Transportation to provide insurance coverage for commercial air carriers in both domestic and international operations. The memorandum states that the continuation of U.S. commercial air transportation is necessary for air commerce, national security, and foreign policy interests. The Secretary of Transportation is approved to provide insurance or reinsurance to air carriers until September 30, 2011, unless reasonable terms and conditions cannot be obtained from any authorized insurance company. The memorandum also instructs that this determination be brought to the attention of all air carriers and published in the Federal Register.
