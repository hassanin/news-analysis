President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed May 15, 2022, as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 15 through May 21, 2022, as Police Week. In his proclamation, he acknowledges the dedication and sacrifice of law enforcement officers who put their lives at risk to protect communities. He emphasizes the need to fund law enforcement with resources and training to effectively combat rising gun violence and other violent crimes. The American Rescue Plan and the proposed 2023 budget aim to support law enforcement through increased funding for community policing and agencies like the United States Marshals and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. The President also addresses the issue of gun violence targeting both community members and law enforcement officers, particularly mentioning the Department of Justice's efforts to address the proliferation of "ghost guns." He emphasizes the importance of protecting the physical safety and mental well-being of law enforcement officers and highlights the bills signed into law to extend counseling and mental health resources. President Biden rejects the idea of defunding the police and instead advocates for secure streets achieved through policing that treats everyone with dignity and respect. He calls on Americans to observe Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week with appropriate ceremonies and activities, honoring the brave officers who lost their lives in the line of duty and supporting law enforcement in creating a safer and more just America.
