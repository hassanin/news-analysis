President Donald Trump has proclaimed April 19 through April 25, 2020, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. This week is dedicated to acknowledging the abuse and trauma experienced by victims of crimes and recognizing the efforts of advocates who support crime victims. The proclamation expresses appreciation for those who support crime victims and reaffirms the commitment to reducing the trauma of crime. The Trump Administration remains focused on helping victims recover from physical, emotional, and financial suffering. Initiatives such as the Victims of Immigrant Crime Engagement (VOICE) Office and grants from the Department of Justice's Office for Victims of Crime provide support and assistance to victims. Local programs for domestic violence, elder abuse, child advocacy, rape crisis, homicide support, and other victim assistance are also funded. The proclamation emphasizes the critical role of law enforcement officers in supporting crime victims, and the Administration's commitment to empowering them. The establishment of the Presidential Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice aims to enhance public safety and oversight. The proclamation highlights the need to expand access to quality services for crime victims and to fight for their justice. It calls on all Americans, organizations, and communities to work together to support crime victims and protect their rights.
