Fifty years ago, on July 20, 1969, the Apollo 11 astronauts landed on the Moon and planted the American flag. This achievement, fulfilling President John F. Kennedy's goal set in 1961, captivated the world and left a sense of pride among Americans. President Kennedy had announced his ambition for the United States to go to the Moon before the end of the decade, and his successor, President Lyndon Johnson, maintained America's commitment to space exploration. The three astronauts, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, returned safely to Earth and were hailed as heroes. However, enthusiasm for space exploration waned over time, and the National Space Council was disbanded in 1993. Now, 50 years later, President Donald J. Trump has renewed America's commitment to space exploration by relaunching the National Space Council and aiming to put Americans back on the Moon by 2024. The United States also plans to establish a sustainable human presence on the Moon by 2028 and explore Mars in the future. Vice President Mike Pence, who chairs the National Space Council, will celebrate the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 at the Kennedy Space Center and emphasize the importance of returning to the Moon and advancing space exploration.
