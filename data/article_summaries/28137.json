President Trump announced a breakthrough agreement to dramatically reduce the out-of-pocket cost of insulin for seniors enrolled in Medicare. Under the agreement, participating Medicare plans will cap the cost of insulin at $35 per month per type, and some plans may offer it for free. This represents a significant reduction in cost, as some seniors were previously paying anywhere from $50 to over $200 per month for insulin. The President emphasized that this will provide tremendous savings for seniors and help prevent serious health complications associated with diabetes. He also mentioned that this achievement would not have been possible without the elimination of certain regulations and the introduction of competition in the healthcare market. Additionally, the President praised the collaboration between insurers, manufacturers, and other key players in reaching this agreement.
