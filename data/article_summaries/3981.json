President Biden is set to visit Superior, Wisconsin, to announce nearly $5 billion in funding for major transportation projects as part of his Investing in America agenda. This includes $1 billion to replace the deteriorating Blatnik Bridge, which is predicted to close by 2030. The investment will expand weight capacity, improve safety, and increase accessibility for pedestrians and cyclists. Other key projects include replacing the I-5 Bridge over the Columbia River, improving 10 miles of I-10 in Arizona, making multimodal improvements in the I-376 corridor of Pittsburgh, and reconnecting communities divided by the Cross Bronx Expressway in New York. Half of the funding announced is going to projects in rural areas. These investments aim to create jobs, improve transportation systems, and unlock economic opportunity. Previous funding announcements have already seen progress, with construction set to begin on the Brent-Spence Bridge and the Hudson River Tunnel, among other projects. Overall, the Biden Administration has announced over $400 billion in infrastructure funding and mobilized over $640 billion in private sector investments.
