The United States expresses deep disappointment with the conviction and sentencing of former Prime Minister of Ukraine, Yulia Tymoshenko, which is seen as a politically motivated prosecution. The charges against Tymoshenko and the conduct of her trial, as well as the prosecution of other opposition leaders and members of the previous government, raise concerns about Ukraine's commitment to democracy and the rule of law. The United States supports Ukraine's goal of becoming a democratic and prosperous European state and emphasizes the need for efforts to protect and advance democracy and the rule of law. The United States urges the release of Tymoshenko and other political leaders and believes they should have the unrestricted ability to participate in political life, including the upcoming parliamentary elections.
