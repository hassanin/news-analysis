The United States and China have agreed to work together to phase down the consumption and production of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) as part of their efforts to combat global climate change. HFCs are potent greenhouse gases used in refrigerators, air conditioners, and industrial applications. Although they do not deplete the ozone layer, their use is rapidly growing and could contribute to 20% of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 if left unchecked. The United States, Canada, and Mexico have been proposing an amendment to the Montreal Protocol, a global agreement to combat ozone depletion, to phase down HFCs. This amendment would gradually reduce consumption and production of HFCs and require reporting and control of byproduct emissions. The phase down of HFCs could potentially reduce 90 gigatons of CO2 equivalent by 2050.
