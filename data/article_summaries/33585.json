Second Lady Karen Pence visited the Tracy's Kids Art Therapy Program at the Henry Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine. The program provides art therapy for military children with cancer, aiming to help them cope with the emotional stress of their illness and treatment. Mrs. Pence observed an art therapy session led by a Tracy's Kids art therapist and viewed artwork created by the children. She expressed her support for the program and its positive impact on the children. Tracy's Kids is a nonprofit organization that offers free art therapy to pediatric cancer patients and their siblings at various hospitals. The collaboration with the Henry Jackson Foundation will establish its eighth location.
