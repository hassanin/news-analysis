This presidential memorandum, issued by President Donald J. Trump, states that the domestic production capability for inert materials for munitions is deemed essential to national defense. The memorandum invokes section 303 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, and determines that without presidential action, the United States industry would not be able to adequately and timely provide the production capability for these materials. It further states that purchases, purchase commitments, or other action under section 303 of the Act are the most cost-effective, expedient, and practical method for meeting this critical capability. The memorandum concludes by authorizing and directing its publication in the Federal Register.
