The White House has sent Congress a list of immigration reforms that were created in collaboration with law enforcement officers and public servants. President Trump and his administration have held numerous meetings with both Republican and Democrat leaders to discuss these reforms and find a bipartisan solution. The White House will release a legislative framework on Monday that aims to address securing the border, ending extended-family chain migration, canceling the visa lottery, and providing a permanent solution for DACA. The statement emphasizes the need for Congress to take action on this issue, as it has been unresolved for many years.
