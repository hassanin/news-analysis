President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation declaring the week of September 15 to September 21, 2019, as "National Gang Violence Prevention Week." The proclamation highlights the administration's efforts to indict, convict, imprison, and remove members of gangs and cartels who commit violent acts against Americans. It emphasizes the dedication to identify and dismantle criminal networks and bring individuals participating in them to justice. The administration has increased efforts and resources to catch, prosecute, and remove criminals from the streets, partnering with state, local, and tribal law enforcement. The Department of Justice has brought more cases against violent criminals in fiscal year 2018 than ever before. The administration is also combating transnational criminal organizations, especially on the southern border, where gangs are involved in murder, extortion, narcotics and weapons trafficking, human smuggling and trafficking, and other criminal activities. The administration has signed executive orders to dismantle these organizations and enhance the safety of law enforcement officers. The DOJ is working with law enforcement in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to fight against dangerous criminal organizations that try to enter the United States. The partnership, called Operation Regional Shield, has resulted in the indictment of over 7,000 criminal gang members. The administration remains committed to securing the border and stopping criminal gangs, drug smugglers, and human traffickers. The proclamation calls for observing National Gang Violence Prevention Week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
