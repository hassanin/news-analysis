President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Wisconsin due to severe storms, flooding, and mudslides that occurred in September 2016. This declaration allows federal aid to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts. The affected counties are eligible for federal funding for emergency work, facility repairs or replacements, and hazard mitigation measures. Benigno Bern Ruiz has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
