President Donald J. Trump has issued an Executive Order to revive the National Space Council, which was originally established by President George H.W. Bush in 1989. The Council's purpose is to advise and assist the President on national space policy and strategy. The Council ceased operation in 1993 but has now been revived to reinvigorate America's leadership in space, strengthen the economy, and advance national security. Vice President Mike Pence, as the Chairman of the National Space Council, will play a crucial role in shaping America's space policy. The Vice President expressed his honor and enthusiasm for this role, stating that the Administration's commitment to space exploration will strengthen the American spirit and inspire the nation to venture into the unknown.
