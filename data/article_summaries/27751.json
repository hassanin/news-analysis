The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has released the results of its annual estimates on coca cultivation and cocaine production in Colombia. The report reveals that Colombian coca cultivation reached an all-time high, increasing by 11% from 2016 to 2017. Potential pure cocaine production also increased by 19% during the same period. These increases in coca production are directly linked to greater cocaine use in the United States, resulting in an increase in overdose deaths and other crime and violence associated with the drug trade. The number of new cocaine users in the United States has increased by 81% since 2013, and overdose deaths involving cocaine have more than doubled. The ONDCP emphasizes that Colombia must do more to address this increase and reverse the trend. The United States and Colombian governments have agreed to develop a plan to cut cultivation and production levels by half over the next five years.
