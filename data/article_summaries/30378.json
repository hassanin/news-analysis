President Donald Trump has issued an executive order prohibiting the acquisition of StayNTouch, Inc. by Beijing Shiji Information Technology Co., Ltd. and its subsidiary, Shiji (Hong Kong) Ltd. The order states that there is credible evidence suggesting that the acquisition could pose a threat to the national security of the United States. The Purchaser is ordered to divest all interests in StayNTouch and its assets within 120 days, subject to conditions imposed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Until the divestment is completed, the Purchaser is prohibited from accessing hotel guest data through StayNTouch. The order also authorizes CFIUS to implement measures to verify compliance and protect national security interests. The Attorney General is authorized to enforce the order, and the President reserves the right to issue further orders to protect national security.
