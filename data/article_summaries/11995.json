President Obama has authorized the use of up to $26 million from the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund to respond to the conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile states of Sudan. The funds will support the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in providing protection and assistance to over 140,000 refugees who have fled the two states. The United States is concerned about the situation in South Kordofan and Blue Nile, particularly as violent clashes continue along the shared border with South Sudan. The US is urging the government of Sudan to allow full access for international humanitarian agencies to provide emergency assistance. Additionally, the US is calling on Sudan and South Sudan to exercise restraint and reach a negotiated settlement on outstanding issues, including nationality, border, and oil agreements.
