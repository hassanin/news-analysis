President Joe Biden has proclaimed April 22, 2022, as Earth Day in the United States. In his proclamation, he emphasizes the urgency of addressing climate change and protecting the environment. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's recent report provided further evidence that climate change is already happening. The climate crisis is causing extreme weather events, costing billions of dollars and claiming lives. Environmental injustices disproportionately affect communities of color, low-income communities, and Indigenous communities. To address these challenges, President Biden has launched an ambitious environmental and climate agenda, including goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, achieve carbon pollution-free electricity, and reach a net-zero emissions economy. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is seen as an opportunity to accelerate efforts to confront environmental and climate challenges. The administration aims to invest in various initiatives, such as remediating abandoned mine lands, investing in coastal wetlands, replacing lead pipes, restoring watersheds, and building resilience to climate impacts. The administration is committed to ensuring that these investments promote equity and justice and reach all communities. President Biden also emphasizes the global nature of the climate crisis and the need for international cooperation. He encourages all Americans to participate in programs and activities that deepen their understanding of environmental protection and climate change.
