Executive Order 13522, issued by President Barack Obama on December 9, 2009, establishes labor-management forums in the executive branch of the US government. The purpose of these forums is to improve labor-management relations and enhance the delivery of government services. The order establishes the National Council on Federal Labor-Management Relations, which advises the President on labor-management relations matters. The Council is composed of various members appointed by the President, including representatives from federal agencies, labor unions, and professional associations. The Council's responsibilities include supporting the creation of labor-management forums at the department or agency level, collecting and disseminating information on labor-management relations improvement efforts, and developing recommendations for innovative ways to improve service delivery and cut costs. The order also requires executive departments and agencies to establish labor-management forums and allows for negotiation over permissive subjects of bargaining. The order does not abrogate any existing collective bargaining agreements and is intended to improve internal management without creating any new rights or benefits enforceable by law.
