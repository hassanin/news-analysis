The Department of Energy (DOE) has announced the signing of an agreement with the People's Republic of China to establish a Center of Excellence in China for nuclear security and safeguards. The agreement was signed by U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu and China Atomic Energy Authority Chairman Chen Qiufa. The center will serve as a central site for training in nuclear security, exchanging technical information, sharing best practices, and promoting technical collaborations. It will also meet the training needs for China's expanding nuclear sector and promote nuclear security best practices in Asia. The agreement reflects the commitment of both governments to strengthen cooperation in nuclear non-proliferation, nuclear security, and combating nuclear terrorism. The center will focus on training nuclear site personnel, developing security systems, and providing hands-on training on international nuclear safeguards requirements. The DOE's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) will provide equipment, develop training programs, and facilitate exchanges of best practices. The NNSA is a semi-autonomous agency within the DOE responsible for enhancing national security through the military application of nuclear science. Its Material Protection, Control, and Accounting Program collaborates with partner countries to improve the security of nuclear weapons and materials.
