Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech in the East Room, celebrating the passage of a law that will end forced arbitration in cases of sexual abuse. Forced arbitration has been criticized for silencing survivors of sexual assault and harassment, protecting predators, and depriving individuals of their right to seek justice in court. The legislation will apply retroactively, invalidating all previous agreements. Harris acknowledged the bipartisan effort that led to this moment and expressed the administration's commitment to working on broader forced arbitration legislation to protect workers' rights in cases of wage theft, racial discrimination, and unfair labor practices. She thanked the survivors and their allies for their courage and resilience in demanding change. Gretchen Carlson, who played a key role in the passage of the law, was welcomed to the podium.
