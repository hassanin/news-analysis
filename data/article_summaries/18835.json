President Barack Obama will be hosting a White House Conference on the Administration's new vision for America's future in space in Florida on April 15. The conference will discuss the new course the Administration is charting for NASA and the future of U.S. leadership in human space flight. Topics will include the goals and strategies of the new vision, the next steps, and the new technologies, jobs, and industries it will create. The President has allocated an additional $6 billion for NASA in the FY2011 budget over the next five years to help achieve these goals. The President's plan aims to set NASA on a more dynamic, flexible, and sustainable trajectory, investing in the development of technologies and capabilities to support journeys to the Moon, asteroids, and eventually Mars. The plan is seen as a reinvigoration of space exploration after years of underinvestment and unrealistic budgeting.
