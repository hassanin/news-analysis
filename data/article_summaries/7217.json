The Biden-Harris administration has released a multi-year Alternatives, Rehabilitation, and Reentry Strategic Plan to provide meaningful opportunities for redemption and rehabilitation to people who have been incarcerated. The plan aims to strengthen public safety by reducing unnecessary interactions with the criminal justice system, supporting rehabilitation during incarceration, and facilitating successful reentry into society. It includes over 100 concrete policy actions to improve the criminal justice system and leverage successful strategies from state and local governments. As part of Second Chance Month, President Biden is also commuting the sentences of 31 individuals serving time for non-violent drug offenses who have demonstrated a commitment to rehabilitation. The Strategic Plan focuses on expanding access to health care, safe and affordable housing, education, government-issued identification, food and subsistence benefits, and job opportunities. It also addresses issues such as the cost of communication for incarcerated individuals, access to banking and financial services, support for veterans and tribal members, private sector hiring, addressing fines and fees, reducing barriers for eligible voters, and supporting sealing and expungement of records. The plan emphasizes the need for collective efforts from the private sector, government entities, academia, and nonprofit organizations to create a safer, stronger, and more just America.
