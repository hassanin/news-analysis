Karen Pence, the Second Lady of the United States, shares her personal experience with art therapy and her passion for promoting its benefits. She first learned about art therapy during a tour of Disneyland, where she asked illustrators about the use of computer-assisted art techniques in teaching. She was introduced to Tracy's Kids, an art therapy program for children with cancer in Washington, DC, and became involved with the organization. Art therapy is a mental health profession that utilizes art making to improve the well-being of individuals of all ages. It involves the art, the therapist, and the client, and is not simply arts and crafts. Art therapists have a master's or doctorate degree in art therapy and are trained psychotherapists. Art therapy has been found to be beneficial for various conditions, including cancer, anxiety, PTSD, traumatic brain injuries, eating disorders, autism, end-of-life issues, and abuse. Karen Pence is dedicated to raising awareness about art therapy and sharing her experiences through her initiative, "Art Therapy: Healing with the HeART."
