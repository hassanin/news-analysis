The United States and China have reached an agreement to phase down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). They have established a contact group under the Montreal Protocol to address issues such as cost-effectiveness, financial and technology support, safety, environmental benefits, and an amendment to the protocol. Both countries emphasize the importance of the Montreal Protocol and commit to working with other nations to find a multilateral solution. The agreement also ensures that HFCs will still be included in the scope of the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol provisions for accounting and reporting of emissions.
