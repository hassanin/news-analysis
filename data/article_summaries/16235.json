On June 19, 2009, President Obama began a national conversation on responsible fatherhood and healthy families. He visited various non-profit organizations in Washington, D.C. that focus on youth mentorship, accompanied by fathers and mentors. The President then participated in a town hall on fatherhood at the White House, where five fathers from diverse backgrounds shared their personal stories and commitment to fatherhood and personal responsibility. The event included a question and answer session. Finally, President Obama joined fathers, mentors, and DC area youth for mentoring sessions and other activities on the White House South Lawn.
