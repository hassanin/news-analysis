The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has released the National Interdiction Command and Control Plan (NICCP), which outlines the Trump Administration's strategy to reduce the availability of illicit drugs in the United States. The plan emphasizes the importance of coordination among federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies to disrupt Transnational Criminal Organizations that traffic drugs into the country. The administration has also released counternarcotics strategies for both the Southwest and Northern borders. The Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy focuses on preventing drug trafficking along the U.S.-Mexico border, while the Northern Border Counternarcotics Strategy aims to prevent the illegal trafficking of drugs across the U.S.-Canada border. The release of these strategies highlights the administration's commitment to addressing the drug crisis and protecting American citizens.
