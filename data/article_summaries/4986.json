President Biden will meet with a bipartisan group of governors to discuss innovative ways they are getting their own communities vaccinated. He will announce additional efforts to reach his goal of having 70% of the U.S. adult population with at least one vaccine shot by July 4th. Some of the actions he will highlight include a new program from ride-sharing companies Lyft and Uber, which will offer free rides to vaccination sites, partnerships between federal retail pharmacy partners and community colleges to provide on-site clinics, and funding available through FEMA for community outreach and engagement efforts. The aim is to eliminate barriers to vaccination and drive the country closer to achieving the vaccination goal.
