In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims May 8 through May 14, 2011, as National Women's Health Week. He emphasizes the importance of women's health and the impact it has on families, communities, and the country. The article highlights the need to ensure that women have access to the healthcare they require and the freedom to make the best health choices for themselves and their loved ones. It also mentions how insurance companies used to discriminate against women and charge them higher premiums, but thanks to the Affordable Care Act, this is no longer allowed. The Act provides women with more control over their healthcare, allowing them to choose their own doctors and ensuring coverage for preventive care and basic health services. National Women's Health Week is an opportunity for women to prioritize their health and embrace healthier lifestyles. The article encourages women to schedule annual checkups, discuss important health screenings with their healthcare providers, and access resources available on websites like WomensHealth.gov and GirlsHealth.gov. The proclamation concludes by urging all Americans to celebrate the progress made in protecting women's health and to promote awareness, prevention, and educational activities that improve the health of all women.
