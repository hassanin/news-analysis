President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to the Central African Republic, declared in Executive Order 13667 on May 12, 2014, will continue beyond May 12, 2022. The situation in the Central African Republic has been marked by a breakdown of law and order, intersectarian tension, the use of child soldiers, and widespread violence and atrocities. These dynamics pose a threat to the peace, security, and stability of the Central African Republic and neighboring states, as well as to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Biden has determined it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
