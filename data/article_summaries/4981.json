President Biden has authorized Fire Management Assistance Grants to support firefighting efforts in Washington State, where wildfires are currently burning. He has also directed FEMA to deploy personnel and supplies to California in response to Tropical Storm Hilary. The President has been receiving regular updates on the storm and has spoken to Governor Newsom about emergency preparedness measures. The administration has deployed federal personnel to Nevada and is coordinating with Arizona, California, and Nevada to provide resources. 

President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden are en route to Maui, Hawaii, where they will meet with survivors, first responders, and officials to discuss the devastating wildfires. The President has been receiving updates from his senior team and Administrator Criswell on the ongoing recovery efforts. During their visit, the President and First Lady will visit Lahaina to survey the damage and receive a briefing from local officials. The President will honor the victims and their families and announce that Bob Fenton will be named chief federal response coordinator for Maui, leading the long-term effort to help the community rebuild and recover. 

Administrator Criswell provided operational updates, including the progress of search and rescue efforts and the distribution of assistance to residents. She also addressed concerns about developers buying land and evictions, stating that the governor is committed to preventing such actions. The administration will support the governor's decisions on rebuilding. Criswell also discussed the appointment of Bob Fenton as chief federal response coordinator, emphasizing his experience and ability to coordinate federal resources. 

The President has been engaged in the response efforts and has asked tough questions of his team, pushing for additional resources and faster assistance. He has declared climate change an existential threat and has taken significant action to address it, including signing the most significant climate bill in history and invoking the Defense Production Act for clean energy technologies. The administration is committed to supporting Maui's recovery in the long term and providing assistance to affected schools and students. 

There are no updates on the possibility of a national disaster safety board or a national emergency declaration on climate. The President's funding situation was discussed, with the Disaster Relief Fund expected to go into a negative balance in September. The requested supplemental funding will allow the administration to continue working through the end of the fiscal year, but the need for additional funding will depend on the impacts of future disasters. The EPA has been mission-assigned to assist with air monitoring in the affected area. President Biden's activities during his vacation in Hawaii were not disclosed, but he has been engaged in addressing extreme weather events. There is no information on whether he plans to watch the Republican debate or the plans to mark the 60th anniversary of the March on Washington.
