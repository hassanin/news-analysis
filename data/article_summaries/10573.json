The White House has issued a statement from Robert Gibbs praising the Bipartisan Policy Center's Health Reform Proposal. The proposal, led by three former Senate Majority Leaders, aligns with the President's core principles of lowering costs, guaranteeing choice, ensuring quality and affordable healthcare for all Americans, and maintaining fiscal discipline. The statement acknowledges the unsustainable nature of the current healthcare system and applauds the bipartisan effort demonstrated in the report.
