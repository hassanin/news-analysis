President Donald Trump issued a proclamation on January 18, 2019, marking the 46th year since the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade. On National Sanctity of Human Life Sunday, the President expressed his commitment to defending the Right to Life and protecting innocent human life at every stage. He reinstated the Mexico City Policy, which prevents foreign aid from funding or supporting the global abortion industry. Efforts are also being made to end elective late-term abortion and to implement regulations that prohibit funding programs that include abortion as a method of family planning. The President supports the Hyde Amendment, which prevents taxpayer funding for abortion, and has vowed to veto any legislation that weakens existing federal protections for human life. The Administration has shown respect for human life and conscience by providing exemptions to the contraceptive mandate for employers with religious beliefs. The President also emphasized the need to protect the sanctity of life for the most vulnerable, including people with disabilities. He praised the pro-life movement for its efforts to prevent the deaths of innocent unborn children, and called on Congress to protect and defend the dignity of every human life. The President urged the American people to support adoption and foster care and to care for women in unexpected pregnancies. He concluded by asking citizens to raise their voices for all those affected by abortion. As a result, January 20, 2019, was proclaimed as National Sanctity of Human Life Day.
