President Donald Trump has issued an Executive Order with respect to Venezuela, taking additional steps regarding the national emergency declared in previous Executive Orders. The new order addresses actions by individuals affiliated with the illegitimate Maduro regime, including human rights violations, arbitrary arrests, curtailment of press freedom, harassment of political opponents, and attempts to undermine the Interim President and the Venezuelan National Assembly. The order also expands the definition of the "Government of Venezuela" to include various entities and individuals associated with the regime.
