On March 28, 2019, President Donald Trump issued an executive order regarding the rates of basic pay and salaries for various positions within the United States government. The order sets forth the rates for the statutory pay systems, such as the General Schedule and the Foreign Service Schedule, as well as the schedules for the Veterans Health Administration. It also establishes the ranges of rates for senior executives in the Senior Executive Service. The order further outlines the rates of basic pay for positions such as the Vice President, members of Congress, and justices and judges. Additionally, it specifies the rates of monthly basic pay for members of the uniformed services and the rate of monthly cadet or midshipman pay. The order also addresses locality-based comparability payments and administrative law judges. The effective dates for the different schedules vary, with some going into effect on January 1, 2019. This executive order supersedes a previous order issued in December 2018.
