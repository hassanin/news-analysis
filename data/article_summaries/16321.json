President Obama has authorized an increase in federal funding for public assistance projects in North Dakota due to flooding that occurred between February 14 and July 20, 2011. The increase in funding raises the federal share for public assistance from 75% to 90% of total eligible costs. This funding is part of the major disaster declaration issued for North Dakota on May 10, 2011, which also provided funding for individual assistance and hazard mitigation.
