The Biden-Harris Administration has announced that the United States will strengthen its partnership with the Kingdom of Bahrain. This includes the launch of the "Comprehensive Security Integration and Prosperity Agreement" (C-SIPA), which aims to promote cooperation in areas such as defense, security, science, technology, and trade. The agreement formalizes cooperation to deter conflict, enhance regional stability, de-escalate tensions, and bolster trade and economic cooperation. The United States and Bahrain have a long-standing partnership, with Bahrain hosting the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet and being a Major Non-NATO Ally and Major Security Partner. The agreement was signed by Secretary Blinken and Crown Prince/Prime Minister Salman in an official ceremony at the State Department. It signifies the United States' enduring commitment to Bahrain and the region in support of peace and shared prosperity. The partnership aims to create a more peaceful, secure, and integrated Middle East region.
