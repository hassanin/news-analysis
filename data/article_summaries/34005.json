President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation declaring May 3 as the National Day of Prayer. In the proclamation, he emphasized the importance of prayer and its role in sustaining the nation throughout its history. He highlighted how prayer was fundamental to the founding of the United States, with the Continental Congress praying for guidance during the pursuit of freedom from Great Britain. Prayer has also been sought during times of conflict and darkness, such as World War II and the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. The proclamation encourages all Americans, regardless of their faith, to observe the National Day of Prayer and reflect on the blessings of the nation. It suggests participating in appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities in houses of worship, communities, workplaces, schools, and homes.
