Vice President Kamala Harris will announce the winners of the $125 million Capital Readiness Program (CRP) awards competition, which aims to support underserved small businesses' access to capital. The CRP is part of the American Rescue Plan and is the latest investment in navigation and support services for small businesses. The program is administered by the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) and is the largest-ever direct federal investment in small business incubators and accelerators. The 43 winning organizations, including non-profits, community-based organizations, and private sector entities, will form partnerships to assist and train underserved entrepreneurs in high-growth industries such as healthcare, climate resilient technology, and infrastructure. Additionally, the Biden-Harris Administration is approving awards for up to $58 million to 12 states as part of the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) Technical Assistance Grant Program. These initiatives are part of the administration's efforts to support small businesses and underserved entrepreneurs as part of their economic growth plan.
