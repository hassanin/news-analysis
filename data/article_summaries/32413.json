The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and its partners, including the federal government and private sector, worked together to restore power to areas impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017. The recovery from these hurricanes was challenging, with almost 47 million Americans affected and $265 billion in damages caused. Despite the difficulties, Americans came together to help restore power and rebuild lives. The DOE deployed emergency responders and sent teams to assess power generation in affected areas. Puerto Rico faced particularly difficult challenges, with its infrastructure severely damaged and the majority of its electricity customers left without power. However, significant progress was made, especially after Puerto Rico requested mutual aid from the President. The DOE worked closely with the Puerto Rican government, federal partners, and private sector utilities to coordinate and expedite the response. In addition to immediate restoration efforts, the DOE also provided recommendations for long-term grid resilience in Puerto Rico and is supporting the development of a modern and reliable grid system. The success of these efforts will depend on the leadership and commitment of the Puerto Rican government and its utility, PREPA. The DOE remains a supportive partner in achieving Puerto Rico's goal of a reliable, resilient, and affordable electric sector.
