The author, Alex Croxford, reflects on his experience as a White House intern. Growing up on a farm in southern Illinois, he was excited for the opportunity to work in Washington, D.C. and gain insight into the inner workings of the government. He praises the office staff for being open and confident in his abilities. Although his daily tasks at the White House differ from those on the farm, he is pleased with the skills he has developed and is eager to contribute his talents to serving the nation. Croxford is impressed by the passion and devotion of the people he has worked with, and believes they serve rural Midwest communities well in the highest offices of the federal government.
