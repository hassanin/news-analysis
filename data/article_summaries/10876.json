The White House released a report criticizing the Student Success Act approved by Republicans on the House Education and Workforce Committee. The report claims that the legislation would lock in sequestration funding levels, eliminate accountability for taxpayer dollars, and allow states to shift funds from high-poverty schools to more affluent districts. The report also provides a state-by-state impact of locking in funding levels and a list of school districts most negatively impacted by changes to the Title I allocation formula. The White House argues that cutting education funding and allowing states to reduce overall education spending would hinder student success. President Obama has a different vision for improving schools, which includes reducing student testing, ensuring accountability, and investing in education programs. The President's budget proposes an additional $2.7 billion in funding for ESEA programs and expanding high-quality preschool.
