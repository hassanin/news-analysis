During a flight to Philadelphia, OMB Director Shalanda Young and White House Press Secretary Olivia Dalton discussed the President's upcoming budget proposal. Young emphasized that the budget is built around four values: investing in Americans, protecting and strengthening Social Security and Medicare, reducing the deficit, and asking the wealthiest to pay their fair share. She mentioned that the budget includes reversals to the 2017 tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations, but the President is committed to not supporting new taxes for those making under $400,000. Young also addressed Republican criticism, stating that the budget focuses on cutting wasteful spending and closing tax loopholes. When asked about finding common ground with Republicans, she highlighted the President's history of working with Republicans and expressed confidence in continuing bipartisan collaboration. The press briefing also briefly touched on the recent conflict in Ukraine and the President's upcoming travel plans.
