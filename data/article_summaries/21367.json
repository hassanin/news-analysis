The White House has announced new commitments from over 100 leading employers, who employ more than 5 million workers, to help front-line workers develop new skills and earn higher wages. These commitments include expanding access to apprenticeships and on-the-job training, making training opportunities cheaper and easier, and clarifying the skills needed for advancement within companies. In addition, 30 national and local labor unions and major foundations are working with employers to expand access to training strategies like apprenticeships. The private sector and tech leaders are also developing tools and resources to disseminate best practices for employers and workers. The Upskill Initiative is a public-private effort to create clear pathways for the over 20 million workers in front-line jobs to progress into higher-paying jobs.
