The Supreme Court has temporarily halted a lower court decision that tried to override the FDA's long-standing approval of mifepristone. As a result, mifepristone remains available and approved for safe use. The President and his Administration are standing by the FDA's evidence-based approval of the drug and will support the agency's authority to review and regulate prescription drugs. This fight is crucial in light of ongoing attacks on women's health, and efforts will continue to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade.
