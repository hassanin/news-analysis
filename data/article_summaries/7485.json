The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to increasing and supporting the adoption of community school models across the country. Community schools bring wraparound services into school buildings to meet the unique needs of the neighborhoods they serve. These services include mental health supports, dental services, and assistance with shelter and nutrition. The schools operate with the help of school staff who coordinate with school administrators, stakeholders, and local organizations to deliver these services to students, their families, and the community. Research has shown that community schools contribute to increased student attendance, on-time grade progression, and high school graduation.

In the most recent bipartisan funding bill, President Biden secured $150 million for the Full-Service Community Schools program, making it twice as large as last year and five times as large as when he came into office. The Department of Education has announced the 2022 recipients of the FSCS program grant competition, providing $63 million in funding for community schools in more than twenty states. This year's grant competition received the largest number of applications in the program's history, highlighting the significant need for coordinated support to address students' social, emotional, and mental health.

To support community schools, the Biden-Harris Administration is releasing a Toolkit of Federal Resources. This toolkit lists relevant grant programs by federal agency and explains how those grants can be used to provide student services at community schools. It also includes new commitments from various federal agencies to support community schools. The Administration supports the Full-Service Community School model because of its positive effects on students' academic success and overall well-being, particularly for students in high-poverty schools.
