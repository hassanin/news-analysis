President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring April 22-28, 2012, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. The proclamation recognizes the efforts of advocates who work to support victims of crime and calls for increased efforts to secure justice for all victims. It acknowledges the high rates of victimization among certain groups, such as children, seniors, persons with disabilities, immigrants, and traditionally underserved communities. The proclamation highlights the administration's commitment to preventing crime, drug abuse, and violence through partnerships with organizations and agencies at all levels of government. It also mentions initiatives to combat sexual violence, human trafficking, and financial fraud. The proclamation encourages Americans to raise awareness of victims' rights and services and to volunteer to support victims in their time of need.
