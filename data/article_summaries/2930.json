In a press conference at the South Lawn, President Trump was asked about the United States negotiating with the Maduro government in Venezuela and sending back people in Justice Department custody. The President responded by saying that it is okay because they are freeing American people who were held illegally. He mentioned that a deal has been made with Venezuela for free elections, and so far, the requirements have been maintained. When asked if he worries that other governments won't give back the person who was sent back today, the President responded with a simple "no." The press conference ended at 5:25 PM EST.
