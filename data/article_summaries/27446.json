On World Autism Awareness Day, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation honoring individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and expressing appreciation for their contributions to society. The proclamation highlights the need for continued support for Americans with ASD through funding research, optimizing health systems, and enhancing resources and treatments. The administration's economic policies have resulted in the lowest unemployment rate in history for Americans with disabilities, and investments in apprenticeship programs aim to provide more employment opportunities. The safety of individuals with ASD is also a priority, with the signing of Kevin and Avonte's Law, which expands emergency alert programs and authorizes funding for tracking technologies and specialized training for caregivers. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to learn more about autism, improve early diagnosis, understand the challenges faced by individuals with autism, and find ways to support them and their families.
