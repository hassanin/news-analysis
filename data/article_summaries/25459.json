President Donald Trump has issued an Executive Order regarding Iran, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The order aims to deny Iran revenue from sectors such as iron, steel, aluminum, and copper, which could be used to support weapons proliferation, terrorist groups, regional aggression, and military expansion. The order also allows for the blocking of property and interests in property of certain individuals and imposes sanctions on foreign financial institutions involved in significant financial transactions. The President has delegated authority to the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to implement the order.
