The article discusses the concept of place-based growth and its importance in driving overall economic growth. It contrasts place-based growth with trickle-down economics, which argues that cutting taxes for the wealthy will benefit everyone. However, the article argues that trickle-down economics has led to widening inequality, deteriorating infrastructure, and the decline of certain regions.

The article highlights the negative effects of trickle-down economics on communities, such as the loss of anchor employers, the exodus of unionized manufacturers, and the erosion of local public investment. It also mentions the impact of the China Shock, which wiped out manufacturing jobs in certain areas.

In contrast to trickle-down economics, the article advocates for a bottom-up, middle-out approach to growing the economy.

The article argues that place-based policies can lead to more resilient, productive, and innovative communities.

The article discusses several principles that guide the President's economic agenda, including investing in local infrastructure, unlocking private investment in disinvested communities, connecting communities to economic opportunities, supporting science and innovation clusters, prioritizing community engagement, and taking a whole-of-government approach.

The article provides examples of how these principles are being implemented, such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which aims to rebuild infrastructure and connect communities. It also mentions special incentives to encourage private investment in disinvested communities, programs to connect communities to economic opportunities, support for science and innovation clusters, and the stacking of federal resources to support economic development.

The article concludes by highlighting the positive impact of these policies, citing examples of communities that are experiencing economic growth and resurgence. It emphasizes the President's commitment to investing in all of America and ensuring that no community is left behind.
