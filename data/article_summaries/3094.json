During a press briefing, Kate Bedingfield, the White House Communications Director, provided updates on several topics. First, she announced that over $3 billion from President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is now available through the Weatherization Assistance Program to help retrofit households and make homes more energy efficient, reducing utility bills for families. The Department of Energy is also proposing new energy-saving standards for household appliances and equipment to save families money on their utility bills. Bedingfield also mentioned the ongoing confirmation process for Lisa Cook and other qualified nominees for the Federal Reserve and urged senators to support their nominations. When asked about ending Title 42, a public health directive that allows for the expulsion of migrants at the border, Bedingfield stated that the decision is up to the CDC and that the administration is planning for multiple contingencies in case of an influx of migrants. She also discussed the recent declassified intelligence regarding Putin's misinformation and the impact on the war in Ukraine, emphasizing that the goal is to highlight the strategic blunder Russia has made and impose severe costs on Russia. Bedingfield addressed questions about the economy, the President's meeting with House Democrats, and the need for COVID funding. She also provided updates on other topics such as the nomination of Judge Jackson to the Supreme Court, the situation in India, and the administration's stance on Ukraine's security.
