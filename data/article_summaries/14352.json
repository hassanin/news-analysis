President Barack Obama issued a memorandum directing the establishment of a Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies. The purpose of the group is to assess whether the United States is effectively utilizing its technical collection capabilities in light of advancements in communications technologies. The group will evaluate if these capabilities adequately protect national security and advance foreign policy, while also considering the risks of unauthorized disclosure and the need to maintain public trust. The Review Group is required to provide interim findings within 60 days and a final report with recommendations by December 15, 2013.
