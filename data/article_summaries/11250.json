President Obama issued a memorandum directing an inventory of all intelligence files related to the Fort Hood shooting, specifically regarding Major Nidal Malik Hasan. The inventory aims to determine how this intelligence was handled, shared, and acted upon within various departments and agencies. The review will be conducted without interfering with ongoing criminal investigations. The results and recommendations for improvements will be provided to John Brennan, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, who will be the main point of contact for the White House on this matter. Preliminary results are expected by November 30, 2009.
