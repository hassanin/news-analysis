The article discusses a report released by the Obama administration that outlines the benefits of a proposal to allow businesses and investors to immediately deduct the full cost of most investments. The report highlights that this proposal will accelerate $150 billion in tax cuts to 2 million businesses, lower the average cost of capital for business investment by more than 75 percent, and produce about $50 billion in new investment. President Obama will visit a business in Beltsville, Maryland to discuss the report and emphasize how this proposal can help businesses expand and hire. The article also mentions previous tax cuts implemented by the President to encourage private-sector investment and explains how the proposal for 100 percent expensing would further stimulate business investment. The report concludes by stating that expensing can have a significant impact on investment and growth, especially in industries that have been heavily affected by the recession.
