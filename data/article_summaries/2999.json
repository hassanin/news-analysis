The White House National Security Council is hosting a virtual Counter-Ransomware Initiative meeting over two days with ministers and senior officials from over 30 countries and the European Union. The meeting aims to accelerate cooperation to counter ransomware and will cover topics such as national resilience, countering illicit finance, disruption and law enforcement efforts, and diplomacy. The United States is leading the initiative, but it is not viewed solely as a U.S. effort, with many governments playing a crucial role in organizing the meeting. The meeting will be followed by future engagements and collaboration with international partners. The U.S. government has a four-part strategy to combat ransomware, which includes disrupting ransomware infrastructure and actors, bolstering resilience to attacks, addressing the abuse of virtual currency for ransom payments, and leveraging international cooperation to disrupt the ransomware ecosystem. While Russia is not participating in this meeting, the U.S. has a separate channel for discussions on ransomware with Russia.
