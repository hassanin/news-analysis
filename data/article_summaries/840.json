President Joe Biden has proclaimed August 21-27, 2022, as National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week. This is a time to show appreciation for civilian employers who support and honor service members and their families. The National Guard and Reserve play a vital role in the security of the nation, and when activated, they sacrifice their personal and professional lives to protect safety and freedoms. These individuals serve in various roles in their communities, such as teachers, pastors, engineers, and medical professionals. Civilian employers are crucial in providing stability for service members and their families through employment, healthcare, and benefits. The proclamation calls upon the people of the United States, state and local officials, private organizations, and military commanders to honor employers of National Guard and Reserve members through appropriate ceremonies and activities. President Biden, being part of a National Guard family himself, is inspired by those who put their country first, just as his late son, Major Beau Biden, did in the Delaware National Guard.
