On January 29, 2020, President Trump held a ceremony at the White House to sign the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), officially replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump called the USMCA the largest, fairest, most balanced, and modern trade agreement ever achieved. He emphasized that the USMCA is a victory for American workers, farmers, and manufacturers, and highlighted its potential to add 1.2% to the country's GDP and create countless new jobs. Trump thanked Vice President Mike Pence, Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, Jared Kushner, Steve Mnuchin, and other members of Congress who played key roles in getting the deal done. He also acknowledged the presence of Canadian and Mexican officials who were instrumental in the negotiations. The signing of the USMCA comes two weeks after the signing of a trade deal with China. Trump expressed optimism about the future of trade relations with China, stating that the relationship might be the best it has been in a long time.
