The Obama Administration has announced a set of actions aimed at accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States. The actions include unlocking up to $4.5 billion in loan guarantees to support the deployment of innovative EV charging facilities, launching a process to designate alternative fuel corridors for EV charging across the country, inviting state and municipal governments to partner with the federal government to procure EV fleets at a discounted value, hosting an "EV Hackathon" to develop new solutions for EV charging, publishing a guide to federal funding and financing for EVs and charging stations, and signing on 35 new businesses, non-profits, universities, and utilities to provide EV charging access for their workforce. The Administration is also forging a coalition of nearly 50 organizations, including vehicle manufacturers, utilities, charging companies, states, and organizations, to promote EV adoption and charging infrastructure. These actions build on the progress made in the past eight years, which has seen a significant increase in the number of EV models, a decrease in battery costs, and a 40-fold increase in the number of EV charging stations.
