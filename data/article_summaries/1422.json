Today, Susan Rice, the Domestic Policy Advisor, and Cedric Richmond, the White House Public Engagement Director and Senior Advisor, hosted a virtual discussion with leaders of gun violence prevention advocacy groups. The groups included Everytown for Gun Safety, Moms Demand Action, Giffords, and Brady. The discussion focused on the ongoing public health crisis of gun violence in America, the increase in homicides in American cities last year, and possible solutions to make communities safer. The solutions discussed included closing background check loopholes, addressing the issue of unregulated and untraceable "ghost" guns, and expanding community-based violence intervention programs. Rice and Richmond expressed gratitude for the leaders' ideas and persistent advocacy efforts, emphasizing President Biden's support for taking actions to reduce gun violence and his commitment to further steps to make communities safer.
