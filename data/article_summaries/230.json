President Biden and Vice President Harris are meeting with labor leaders to discuss the American Rescue Plan and the President's infrastructure plan. They will focus on creating good-paying union jobs in areas such as roads, bridges, transit, electric vehicle charging stations, broadband, schools, child care centers, and water infrastructure. These investments aim to provide opportunities for Americans who have been left behind and make America more competitive.

President Biden wants the jobs created through infrastructure rebuilding to be filled by diverse, local, well-trained workers who have the option to join a union. This involves expanding registered apprenticeship programs and investing in pipelines to these programs.

Registered apprenticeships, supported by unions such as North America's Building Trades Unions, have been a reliable pathway to the middle class for workers without college degrees. These programs train workers for good jobs while allowing them to earn an income. A study by Mathematica shows that workers can earn an additional $240,000 over their lifetime, or $300,000 including benefits, through these programs. Registered apprenticeships are particularly important as a means for workers who have lost their jobs during the pandemic or young people entering a weak job market to train for future employment while earning a decent income.
