The article discusses the Administration's support for H.R. 2581, also known as the Verify First Act. This act aims to prevent the payment of advance premium tax credits to individuals who are likely ineligible, including illegal immigrants, under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The bill seeks to strengthen the administration's ability to ensure that premium tax credits are appropriately provided to eligible individuals under the American Health Care Act of 2017 (AHCA). The bill would require the Secretary of the Treasury to confirm an individual's citizenship or lawful presence in the United States before granting advance payments. The administration sees this bill as a way to protect the integrity of federal funds and promote a more efficient government that respects taxpayer dollars. If H.R. 2581 is presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend signing it into law.
