In this presidential memorandum, President Donald Trump extends the wind-down period for Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for Liberians. Since 1991, certain Liberian nationals and individuals without nationality who last lived in Liberia have been eligible for either Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or DED, which allows them to stay in the United States. In 2018, Trump determined that conditions in Liberia had improved and no longer warranted a further extension of DED, but an orderly transition period ("wind-down") was necessary. In 2019, he extended the wind-down period for an additional 12 months. However, with efforts underway by Congress to provide legislative relief for Liberian DED beneficiaries, Trump decides to extend the wind-down period through January 10, 2021. This extension aims to facilitate uninterrupted work authorization for those currently in the United States under DED who are eligible to apply for lawful permanent resident status under the Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness provision. The relationship between the United States and Liberia is unique, as Liberia was founded by former African-American slaves in 1847. By providing employment authorization for Liberians in the United States, Trump honors the historic relationship between the two countries and serves the foreign policy interests of the United States.
