President Biden is announcing over 30 new actions to strengthen America's supply chains as part of his Bidenomics agenda. These actions aim to lower costs for American families, ensure reliable deliveries for businesses, strengthen agriculture and food systems, and support domestic union jobs. The President will unveil these actions at the inaugural meeting of the White House Council on Supply Chain Resilience. The Council, established by President Biden, will support the resilience of critical supply chains. The administration has already taken steps to address supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic and has made investments to strengthen supply chains and prevent future disruptions. President Biden's new actions include investing in critical supply chains, planning for long-term resilience, deploying new capabilities to monitor risks, and expanding supply chain risk modeling. The administration is also engaging with allies and partners to strengthen global supply chains through early warning systems and multilateral partnerships.
