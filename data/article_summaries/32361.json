President Donald J. Trump has urged Congress to address the issue of surprise medical billing, which causes confusion and concern for many Americans. The Administration supports the bipartisan efforts of House and Senate members to end this unfair practice. The compromise reached reflects input from doctors and hospitals and has been the result of months of delicate negotiations. The goal is to protect patients from being hit with unexpectedly large medical bills when they are most vulnerable. The Administration is hopeful that Congress will prioritize this issue and pass legislation for the President to sign into law this year.
