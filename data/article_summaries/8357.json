The White House is set to announce renewed commitments to ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic on World AIDS Day 2021. The Biden-Harris administration is taking several steps to accelerate the fight against HIV/AIDS, including releasing the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. The strategy incorporates the latest data on HIV incidence, prevalence, and trends, and focuses on addressing the social determinants of health that influence HIV risk and health outcomes. It also encourages reform of state HIV criminalization laws and seeks to engage the private sector in the national effort to end the HIV epidemic. The President will give remarks on World AIDS Day, highlighting the progress made in battling HIV/AIDS and the importance of treating those with HIV with equity and dignity. The strategy aims to end the HIV epidemic in the United States by 2030. The administration also plans to host the Global Fund's Seventh Replenishment Conference to accelerate progress in ending the three epidemics (HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria) by 2030.
