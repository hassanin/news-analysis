The White House has announced plans to shut down 373 data centers by the end of 2012 as part of a campaign to cut waste. This includes shutting down 178 data centers in 2012 alone. The goal is to shut down a total of 800 data centers by 2015, which is expected to save taxpayers more than $3 billion. The number of federal data centers has increased from 432 to over 2,000 since 1998, resulting in unnecessary redundancy and high costs. Data centers consume a significant amount of electricity and taxpayers are paying for the entire infrastructure. So far, 81 data centers have been closed, and another 114 will be closed this year. The closures will save money on infrastructure, real estate, and energy costs, as well as improve the security of government data. The Department of Defense will close 113 data centers, which total 181,632 square feet. The Campaign to Cut Waste is an effort to eliminate misspent tax dollars in every agency and department across the federal government.
