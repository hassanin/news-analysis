President Trump began his West Coast trip by meeting with leaders from the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Committee. He expressed his commitment to ensuring that Los Angeles won the bid for the Olympics and highlighted the economic benefits that the Games would bring, including the creation of 112,000 jobs and $18 billion in growth for Southern California. Additionally, workers are expected to see $7 billion in new and increased wages as a result of the Games. 

During his trip, President Trump also met with rural leaders in Bakersfield, California to discuss water accessibility. He aims to eliminate outdated regulations that have hindered agricultural projects in the state. The President signed a memorandum to simplify the approval process and improve water supplies in California's Central Valley. 

The next stop on President Trump's trip is Phoenix, Arizona, where residents are experiencing the positive effects of pro-growth and pro-worker policies on their local economy.
