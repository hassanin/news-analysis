President Donald J. Trump has signed a directive that puts human exploration back at the core of America's space program. The directive, called Space Policy Directive 1, aims to refocus America's space program on human exploration and discovery. It marks an important step in returning American astronauts to the moon for the first time since 1972 and establishes a foundation for an eventual mission to Mars. Vice President Mike Pence highlighted the practical importance of this new strategy, emphasizing the enhancement of national security and the spur of innovation. This directive aims to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers and to renew America's national purpose in space exploration.
