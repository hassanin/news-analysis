In a press conference, President Biden addressed the results of the recent election and the state of democracy in America. He acknowledged that while some good Democrats lost, Democrats had a strong night overall, with fewer seat losses in the House of Representatives compared to past Democratic presidents. He also mentioned that voters expressed concerns about rising costs, crime, public safety, and the protection of democracy and the right to choose. 

President Biden emphasized the need to continue addressing these concerns and highlighted his administration's efforts to vaccinate the country, stimulate economic growth, invest in infrastructure, create jobs, lower prescription drug costs, and reduce the federal deficit. He expressed optimism about the future of America and the prospects of his economic agenda, noting that the effects of these policies would become more evident in the coming months.

Regarding foreign policy, President Biden discussed his upcoming meetings with world leaders, including President Xi Jinping of China. He mentioned the need to discuss issues such as Russia's aggression in Ukraine, the possibility of peace negotiations, and the defense of Taiwan. He also addressed concerns about inflation and outlined his plans to address the rising costs faced by working- and middle-class families.

President Biden reaffirmed his commitment to bipartisanship and expressed his willingness to work with Republicans, calling for cooperation to address the needs and interests of the American people. He dismissed the idea of making fundamental concessions but expressed openness to good ideas and compromises on other issues. He also emphasized the importance of unity and the need to move beyond constant political battles.

The President touched on other topics, including his plans to continue addressing climate change, gun violence, and mental health care in America. He also mentioned his intention to run for re-election in 2024 and his belief in the future of America. In response to a question about potential Republican challengers, he jokingly stated that it would be interesting to see Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and former President Donald Trump compete against each other.
