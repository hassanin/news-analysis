The United States has declared that it will not produce or acquire any anti-personnel landmines in the future. This includes not replacing existing stockpiles as they expire. The US is actively seeking solutions that would allow it to join the Ottawa Convention, which bans the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of anti-personnel landmines. The US is also conducting efforts to mitigate the risks associated with the loss of these landmines. Other aspects of the US landmine policy are still being considered and will be shared at a later date. The US remains committed to supporting humanitarian mine action and has been the largest financial supporter of such efforts, providing over $2.3 billion in aid since 1993 in more than 90 countries. The US will continue to work with Ottawa States Parties and non-governmental organizations to address the humanitarian impact of anti-personnel landmines.
