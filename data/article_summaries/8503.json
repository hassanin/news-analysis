The Biden administration is set to announce new vaccination policies through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The OSHA rule will require employers with 100 or more employees to ensure that their workers are fully vaccinated or undergo weekly COVID-19 testing. This rule covers 84 million employees. The CMS rule will require healthcare workers at facilities participating in Medicare and Medicaid to be fully vaccinated. This rule covers approximately 17 million workers at 76,000 healthcare facilities. The deadline for compliance with these rules is January 4, 2022. Non-compliance may result in penalties, including civil monetary penalties and denial of payment. The administration believes that these vaccination requirements will protect workers, reduce hospitalizations and deaths, and help the economy recover from the pandemic.
