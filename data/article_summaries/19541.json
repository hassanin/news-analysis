President Obama has proclaimed May 4 through May 8, 2015, as National Small Business Week. Small businesses are vital to the American economy, employing half of the private sector workforce and creating two out of every three new jobs. The President's Administration has focused on supporting small businesses by providing tax cuts and access to credit. Initiatives such as QuickPay and SupplierPay have helped small businesses thrive. The Affordable Care Act has expanded insurance coverage and reduced healthcare costs, benefiting small businesses. The government is also working to support ventures operated by women, veterans, and underserved populations, and to open new markets for small exporters. National Small Business Week recognizes the contributions of small businesses to the American economy and encourages support for these enterprises.
