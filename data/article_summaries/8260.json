On July 28, 2022, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. declared the continuation of a national emergency with respect to Lebanon. This emergency was initially declared on August 1, 2007, through Executive Order 13441, in response to the actions of certain individuals that threatened the national security and foreign policy of the United States. These actions included undermining Lebanon's legitimate and democratically elected government, contributing to the breakdown of the rule of law through politically motivated violence and intimidation, and interfering with Lebanese sovereignty. Ongoing activities, such as Iran's arms transfers to Hizballah, were cited as examples of actions that undermine Lebanese sovereignty and contribute to instability in the region. The continuation of the national emergency is deemed necessary beyond August 1, 2022, to address these threats. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
