In northern Iraq, U.S. military personnel were attacked by a one-way attack drone, resulting in three service-members being wounded, one critically. Kataib Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed militia, and its affiliated groups claimed responsibility for the attack. President Biden was briefed on the incident and ordered the Department of Defense to prepare response options against those responsible. The President directed strikes against three locations used by Kataib Hezbollah and affiliated groups for unmanned aerial drone activities. The protection of American personnel is a top priority, and the United States will take action if these attacks persist.
