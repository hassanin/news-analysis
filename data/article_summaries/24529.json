President Obama visited a wind manufacturer in Newton, Iowa, where he urged Congress to act on clean energy tax credits in his "To Do List." He highlighted the need to reduce reliance on foreign oil and develop secure domestic energy sources by investing in clean energy manufacturing. The President called on Congress to pass legislation that would extend the Production Tax Credit (PTC) and the 48C Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credit, which support American jobs and manufacturing in the wind industry. The wind industry supports thousands of direct and manufacturing jobs. The President's plan for congressional action includes extending the PTC and expanding the 48C tax credit. The PTC provides a credit for utility scale wind producers, and its expiration would result in job losses. The 48C tax credit provides a 30 percent investment credit to manufacturers who invest in clean energy projects. The program has been successful in leveraging private investment and supporting a secure energy future.
