President Barack Obama has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate stating his intention to continue the national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism. This national emergency was declared in Executive Order 13224 on September 23, 2001, following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The President argues that the threat of terrorism, both from foreign terrorists and the possibility of further attacks on the United States, has not been resolved and continues to pose a significant threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy. Therefore, he has determined that it is necessary to extend the national emergency.
