This executive order, issued by former President Donald Trump on January 12, 2021, outlines the importance of nuclear energy to United States national security and the need to revitalize the nuclear energy sector. The order emphasizes the use of small modular reactors for national defense and space exploration. It directs the Secretary of Defense to establish a plan to demonstrate the energy flexibility capability and cost effectiveness of a Nuclear Regulatory Commission-licensed micro-reactor at a domestic military installation. If successful, opportunities for using this capability will be identified. The order also highlights the Department of Defense's role as a major consumer of energy and the potential for nuclear power to enhance national defense capabilities. It directs the Secretary of Defense to determine the feasibility of advanced nuclear reactors for future space power needs, pilot a transportable micro-reactor prototype, and analyze the use of nuclear power in the military and space exploration. The order further emphasizes the importance of nuclear power in space exploration and directs the NASA Administrator to define requirements for NASA utilization of nuclear energy systems for human and robotic exploration missions through 2040. It also calls for the development of a common technology roadmap that coordinates terrestrial-based advanced nuclear reactor and space-based nuclear power and propulsion efforts. The order concludes by providing definitions for terms used in the order and stating general provisions.
