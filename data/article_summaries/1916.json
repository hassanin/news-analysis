The Department of Education has announced that over $2.7 billion in funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) has been provided through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) under the American Rescue Plan. This funding is a part of the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to equity and shared prosperity. Half of these funds are required to be used for direct financial relief to students, with the expectation that more will be used for that purpose. Colleges and universities across the country are using these funds to support students during the COVID-19 pandemic by providing emergency grants, discharging student debt, and eliminating transcript withholding practices. The funding breakdown for each state and territory is also provided in the article.
