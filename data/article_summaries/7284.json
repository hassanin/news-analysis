Vice President Kamala Harris spoke with President Alejandro Giammattei of Guatemala to follow up on their previous conversations and visits. They discussed the launch of the "Oficinas de Movilidad Segura" (OMS) program on June 12, which aims to manage irregular migration by providing legal pathways for migration, family reunification, and temporary work visas for nationals from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The Vice President mentioned that the joint commitment on OMS with Guatemala has paved the way for similar commitments with Costa Rica and Colombia, all of which aim to provide alternatives to irregular migration to the United States. She also expressed support for Guatemala's upcoming general elections, emphasizing the importance of free, fair, inclusive, and peaceful elections.
