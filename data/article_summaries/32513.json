The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released its advance estimate of U.S. GDP for the second quarter of 2020, showing that real GDP contracted at an unprecedented annualized rate of -32.9 percent. Despite this massive decline, the U.S. economy was in a stronger position compared to previous crises, such as the Financial Crisis of 2008-09, and had a higher growth rate than other advanced economies prior to the pandemic. The decline in GDP was widespread, with consumer spending contributing the most to the decline. However, there are signs of economic activity resuming, as retail sales and industrial production have rebounded in May and June. The forecast is for strong GDP growth in the third quarter. The pace of the recovery so far has exceeded expectations, with job additions and small business reopenings surpassing market outlooks. While the magnitude of the contraction reflects the sacrifices made to slow the spread of COVID-19, the Trump Administration will continue to support the country as it navigates through this crisis.
