The U.S.-Pakistan Clean Energy Partnership aims to address Pakistan's energy challenges and support its commitment to curb climate change. The partnership will work towards increasing energy security and access in a clean and sustainable manner. The United States has committed over $1 billion to support energy sector investments and reforms in cooperation with the Government of Pakistan. The partnership aims to add at least 3,000 megawatts of clean power generation infrastructure to Pakistan's national electricity system, benefiting 30 million people. Areas of cooperation include strengthening regulatory institutions, developing market-based rules, expanding transmission capacity, mobilizing financial resources, and promoting energy efficiency. The partnership will also facilitate regional cooperation in clean energy and foster a new generation of Pakistani energy leaders. The U.S.-Pakistan Energy Working Group will coordinate the work of the partnership.
