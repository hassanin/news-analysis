The President is having lunch with five post-9/11 Minnesota veterans to hear about their experiences and discuss support for veterans. A significant number of post-9/11 veterans are from rural America. The lunch is an opportunity for the President to discuss the steps his administration has taken, including the Veterans Employment Initiative, to ensure veterans have the support they need when they leave the military. Rural Americans make up a large portion of the military, and many veterans face economic challenges, with a 12.4% unemployment rate among post-9/11 veterans. The administration has worked to provide medical care, training, and employment support for veterans in rural communities. The Veterans Employment Initiative has hired over 100,000 veterans in the federal government, and the Department of Veteran Affairs has provided education benefits to over 215,000 veteran students in rural areas. The VA has also targeted funds to improve access and quality of care for rural veterans. The home loan guaranty program has helped over 300,000 rural veterans and service members with housing. The First Lady and Dr. Jill Biden have led Joining Forces, an initiative to provide jobs and economic opportunities for service members and their families. The President has announced a plan to boost veterans hiring and provide training for civilian jobs. This includes tax credits for hiring unemployed veterans and a challenge to the private sector to hire or train 100,000 veterans by the end of 2013. These efforts aim to create jobs and improve economic outcomes for veterans.
