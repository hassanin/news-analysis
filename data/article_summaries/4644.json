Extreme House Republicans are being accused of playing partisan games and risking a government shutdown. This could have damaging impacts, including undermining national security and forcing servicemembers to work without pay. During a shutdown, servicemembers would continue working but wouldn't receive pay until funding is available. Civilian colleagues in the Department of Defense would also be furloughed, disrupting national security. The reason for this risk is the Republicans' efforts to slash funding for vital programs instead of working in a bipartisan manner. The article provides a state-by-state breakdown of the 1.3 million active-duty servicemembers at risk of not getting paid during a shutdown.
