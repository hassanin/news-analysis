The United States and the European Union (EU) have reached an agreement to address shared challenges from China. The agreement includes suspending tariffs for five years and collaborating on inward and outbound investment and tech transfer. The aim is to challenge and counter China's non-market practices in the aerospace sector. This deal is seen as a model for future challenges posed by China. The aerospace sector is crucial for middle-class jobs, employing over 500,000 workers directly and supporting over 700,000 jobs in related industries. The US and EU, as democratic allies, have a long-standing economic relationship and have agreed to update the rules of fair competition and transparency. The agreement was announced during the US-EU Summit, which aims to strengthen ties and work together on the global stage. The agreement establishes a working group to address any disagreements that may arise and ensure a level playing field for workers and industries. The threat from China's unfair economic practices is also acknowledged, and efforts will be made to confront it.
