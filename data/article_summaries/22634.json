The article discusses an executive order issued by President Barack Obama in 2014. The order terminates the immunities granted to the Development Fund for Iraq and certain other Iraqi property and interests in property, which were previously protected under Executive Order 13303. The President determines that the circumstances that led to the initial order have significantly changed, particularly regarding Iraq's progress in resolving outstanding debts and claims. The order does not affect the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13303 or the immunities enjoyed by the Government of Iraq and its property under applicable law. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to take necessary actions to implement the order. The order does not create any legal rights or benefits for any party against the United States. The order will be transmitted to Congress and published in the Federal Register.
