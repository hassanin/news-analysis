In a phone call, President Obama and Leader Pelosi discussed the pressing fiscal matters facing Congress. They agreed on the need for a clean debt limit increase to avoid default and for the House to pass a clean continuing resolution to end the government shutdown. They also expressed willingness to negotiate on a longer-term budget solution once the debt limit is raised and the government reopened. The President thanked Leader Pelosi for her efforts to prevent a default of the nation's credit.
