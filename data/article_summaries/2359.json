The article discusses the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which was passed 33 years ago and is considered one of the most important civil rights laws in US history. The ADA prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in various aspects of public life, including employment, education, transportation, and telecommunications. However, despite the impact of the ADA, there is still work to be done. Disabled Americans continue to face challenges in finding employment and accessing public spaces. The Biden administration has taken steps to advance opportunities for people with disabilities, such as signing an executive order to improve accessibility in the federal workforce and providing funding for accessible transit stations. The article also mentions the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the disability community and highlights efforts to expand Medicaid and improve support for caregivers. The ADA is seen as a foundation for ongoing work towards equality and independence for disabled Americans. President Joe Biden has proclaimed July 26, 2023, as the Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act and encourages Americans to celebrate this milestone.
