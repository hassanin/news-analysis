In a brief statement at Joint Base Andrews, President Biden acknowledged the message sent by voters in the recent primaries, stating that both parties need to address crime and gun violence. He highlighted the billions of dollars given to states and localities to hire police officers and reform police departments, but expressed disappointment that few have taken action. The President also mentioned his request for $300 million in this year's budget to hire and retrain cops, as well as ensure their presence in communities. He urged states and localities to utilize the funds and prioritize crime prevention, police reform, and community policing.
