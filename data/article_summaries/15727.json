The White House has established a task force to address the issue of sexual assault on college campuses. Studies show that one in five women and a substantial number of men experience sexual violence while in college. While there are federal laws in place to make campuses safer, compliance with these laws is inconsistent. The task force, co-chaired by the Office of the Vice President and the White House Council on Women and Girls, will work with various agencies to develop a coordinated federal response to campus rape and sexual assault. The task force's objectives include providing institutions with best practices for preventing and responding to sexual assault, ensuring compliance with legal obligations, increasing transparency of enforcement activities, raising public awareness, and facilitating coordination among agencies. The task force will also consult with external stakeholders and evaluate how its proposals may apply to elementary and secondary schools. Within 90 days, the task force will develop proposals and recommendations for instructions, policies, protocols, measuring success, maximizing effectiveness, and promoting coordination. A report on implementation efforts will be provided to the President annually. This memorandum does not create any enforceable rights or benefits and agencies are required to assist and provide information to the task force. The memorandum will be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to available appropriations. The Secretary of Education is authorized to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
