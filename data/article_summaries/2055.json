The article is a memorandum titled "Presidential Determination No. 2022-12" issued by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. The memorandum is addressed to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Energy. It pertains to a determination made by the President pursuant to Section 1245(d)(4)(B) and (C) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012.

The President states that, after considering various reports, including one submitted by the Energy Information Administration in April 2022, as well as global economic conditions, spare capacity, and the availability of strategic reserves, he has determined that there is a sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran. This determination allows for a significant reduction in the volume of petroleum and petroleum products purchased from Iran by or through foreign financial institutions.

The President concludes by stating that he will continue to closely monitor the situation, and directs the Secretary of State to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
