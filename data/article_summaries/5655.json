The Biden-Harris Administration has announced new action to protect communities from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) pollution. The action includes the first-ever national standard to address PFAS contamination in drinking water. The standard is expected to prevent thousands of deaths and reduce tens of thousands of serious PFAS-attributable illnesses. Clean water advocates, elected officials, and leaders from across the country have praised the announcement. They commend the Biden-Harris administration for prioritizing public health and taking steps to protect communities from the harmful effects of PFAS chemicals.
