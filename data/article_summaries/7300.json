Seventy-five years ago, President Truman signed the Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948, allowing women to serve in the US military. Since then, over three million women have served in the military, starting from the Revolutionary War. Women played a crucial role in World War II, leading to the recognition that the military is stronger with women. Over the years, there have been significant advancements in integrating women into the armed forces, such as the inclusion of women in combat positions. However, there is still progress to be made in enabling all Americans to serve to their fullest potential. President Biden has made it a priority to eliminate obstacles to women's military service, focusing on their safety, inclusion, health, and well-being. The Biden-Harris Administration has taken actions like updating military standards for hair, dress, and fitness, advancing military justice reform, expanding support for survivors of military sexual trauma, strengthening services for women's health and wellness, bolstering support for parenting and caregiving service members, improving economic and housing security for women veterans and transitioning service women, achieving historic "firsts" in women's command roles, and raising visibility of women's service. The administration aims to provide equitable access to benefits and gender-specific health services for women veterans and ensure their leadership roles are recognized.
