Second Lady Karen Pence played a role in reconnecting the sister city relationship between Quito, Ecuador and Coral Gables, Florida. During her visit to Quito, Mrs. Pence met with Quito Mayor Dr. Mauricio Rodas and exchanged gifts. She presented him with a letter and two books about Coral Gables, while Mayor Rodas presented her with a wooden plaque representing Quito to give to the Mayor of Coral Gables. The goal of this cultural exchange is to strengthen the relationship between the two cities. Mrs. Pence, as the Honorary Vice Chair of Sister Cities International, expressed her honor in participating in this exchange. She will complete the exchange by sending the gift from Quito to Coral Gables. Sister Cities International, founded by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956, serves as a platform for citizen diplomacy and has facilitated partnerships between communities in over 145 countries.
