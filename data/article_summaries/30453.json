In a press briefing on July 30, 2019, President Trump discussed a variety of topics including the state of the economy, trade negotiations with China, his remarks about Baltimore, the Federal Reserve, and his potential opponents in the 2020 election. He defended his comments about Baltimore, saying it is a corrupt city and that he has received calls from people there thanking him for getting involved. He also addressed accusations of racism and claimed that he has done more for African Americans than any other president. Trump expressed his desire for a trade deal with Brazil and commented on the health of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, but said he did not have much information about the situation. He also defended his nomination of John Ratcliffe for Director of National Intelligence and criticized the Washington Post for calling Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a "Russian asset."
