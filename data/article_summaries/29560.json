In September 2018, President Trump declared a national emergency due to the threat of foreign interference in United States elections. While there has been no evidence of foreign powers altering election outcomes, the proliferation of digital devices and internet-based communications has increased the vulnerability to foreign interference. The ability of individuals outside the United States to undermine public confidence in elections through unauthorized access to election infrastructure or the distribution of propaganda and disinformation poses a significant threat to national security and foreign policy. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2018 will continue for another year, as announced in accordance with the National Emergencies Act.
