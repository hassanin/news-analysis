President Donald J. Trump has signed an Executive Grant of Clemency (Full Pardon) for Alice Marie Johnson. Ms. Johnson, a 65-year-old great-grandmother, served nearly 22 years in Federal prison for a first-time, non-violent criminal offense. During her time in prison, she demonstrated model behavior, completed various training and education courses, volunteered in a hospice, contributed to art and theater programs, and maintained her Christian beliefs. After her sentence was commuted by President Trump in 2018, she has been actively involved in criminal justice reform efforts and has shared her story of redemption. The pardon is in recognition of her hard work, rehabilitation, and dedication to serving others since her release.
