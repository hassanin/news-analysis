Vice President Kamala Harris visited the Indiana State Library in Indianapolis to discuss the recent Supreme Court decision on abortion rights. She thanked local and state leaders for their work in defending women's rights and criticized the Dobbs decision for taking away a constitutional right from women. Harris highlighted the healthcare crisis created by this decision and the efforts in some states to criminalize health professionals and punish women seeking abortions, even in cases of rape or incest. As a former prosecutor specializing in crimes against women and children, Harris emphasized the importance of a woman's autonomy and authority over her own body. She stated that one can hold personal beliefs and faith while recognizing that the government should not make decisions about a woman's reproductive choices. Harris expressed support for the leaders in Indiana who are proposing a law that would effectively ban abortion for women. She explained that the proposed parameters would limit access to reproductive healthcare, preventing most women from making choices about their bodies. Harris mentioned that President Biden has taken actions to protect women's access to abortion medication and their constitutional right to interstate travel. She also warned that the Dobbs decision could pose risks to other rights, such as contraception and marriage equality. In conclusion, Harris commended the leaders at the table for defending the rights of women in Indiana and throughout the country, emphasizing that protecting the health, safety, and well-being of women is a priority for the President and herself.
