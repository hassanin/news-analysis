It also mentions the President's authority to waive the competitive need limitations under certain conditions. The proclamation further addresses technical errors in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) and the need for modifications to correct them. It states that the modifications to the HTS will be effective on specified dates. The proclamation concludes by superseding any previous proclamations or executive orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation.
