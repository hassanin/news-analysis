President Donald J. Trump is modifying two national monuments to balance the protection of significant objects with public use and access. He aims to end the abuse of the monument review process under the Antiquities Act, which has closed off land to the public. Trump and Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke will work on implementing new land management policies that prioritize public access, infrastructure development, and traditional uses of the land. The administration is committed to conducting a transparent review process for monuments.
