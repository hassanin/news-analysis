The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized the first COVID-19 vaccines for children under the age of five in the United States. Pending recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), parents will be able to get their youngest children vaccinated as early as next week. The vaccines, which are mRNA doses, are considered safe and highly effective for children as young as six months old. The Biden administration has secured vaccine doses for America's youngest children and will begin shipping millions of doses to trusted locations such as pediatricians' offices, children's hospitals, and pharmacies. Parents will be able to schedule vaccinations for their youngest kids starting next week, with appointments increasing in the coming days and weeks. The decision is seen as a significant step in the fight against COVID-19 and will provide relief and peace of mind to parents while helping the nation move forward safely.
