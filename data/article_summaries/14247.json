Congressman Henry Cuellar, representing the 28th Congressional District in Texas, has expressed his support for President Obama's framework agreement on taxes. Cuellar believes that it is important to temporarily extend the tax cuts for all Americans, as raising taxes would burden hardworking families and hinder economic growth. He argues that increasing taxes would discourage business investment, job creation, reduce consumer confidence, and increase market uncertainty. On the other hand, Cuellar believes that extending the tax cuts would help generate economic growth by providing capital for small businesses to expand and invest in new ventures. He cites estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that suggest extending the tax cuts for all Americans could reduce unemployment and generate economic growth. Cuellar acknowledges the need to address long-term fiscal challenges and reduce the deficit, but believes that this should only be reassessed once the economy improves significantly. He calls for bipartisan efforts to find solutions that reduce debt and promote growth for the future of America.
