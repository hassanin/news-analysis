On October 11, 2018, President Trump signed the Hatch-Goodlatte Music Modernization Act, a landmark bill aimed at protecting the intellectual property and creative genius of American musicians. The legislation closes loopholes in digital royalty laws to ensure that songwriters, artists, producers, and providers receive fair payment for the licensing of music. It also creates a single licensing system for digital music providers, sets standard licensing rates for digital performances, and establishes a procedure for collecting performance royalties. The bill passed both houses of Congress unanimously and has wide support throughout the music industry.
