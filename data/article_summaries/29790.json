The Administration supports H.R. 1551, a bill that modifies the production tax credit for advanced nuclear power facilities. The bill aims to fulfill the President's commitment to nuclear energy as a major contributor to the nation's energy production and security. It would direct the Internal Revenue Service to allocate unused portions of the national megawatt capacity limitation to eligible advanced nuclear facilities. This would extend the tax credits for new nuclear reactors currently under construction. The bill also allows for the transfer of credits from public entities to project partners. The Administration continues to support pro-growth policies, including increased domestic energy production, and will work towards simplifying the tax code and reducing rates. If H.R. 1551 is presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend signing it into law.
