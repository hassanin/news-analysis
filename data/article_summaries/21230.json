President Obama has increased federal funding for Public Assistance projects in the state of New Jersey as a result of Hurricane Sandy. The level of federal funding has been raised to 90 percent of the total eligible costs, except for the assistance previously authorized at 100 percent federal funding. This is in addition to the previous authorization of 100 percent federal funding for emergency power restoration assistance and emergency public transportation assistance.
