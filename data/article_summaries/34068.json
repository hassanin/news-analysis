On April 6, 2017, President Donald Trump ordered a strike on the Shayrat military airfield in Syria. The strike was in response to the chemical weapons attack on Syrian civilians in Idlib Province that occurred on April 4. The President directed this action to degrade the Syrian military's ability to conduct further chemical weapons attacks and to discourage the Syrian regime from using or spreading chemical weapons. The President acted in the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States, using his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. He also stated that the United States will take additional action, as necessary, to protect its national interests. The President provided this report to Congress to keep them informed, in accordance with the War Powers Resolution.
