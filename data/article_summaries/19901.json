The United States is committed to supporting Vietnam in developing a 21st-century higher education system. The collaboration between the two countries has been growing annually and includes partnerships with higher education institutions and companies. Through US assistance, 30,000 university students in Vietnam have already benefited from curriculum support, training, and capacity building in engineering and social work education. The support has now expanded to include science, technology, engineering, math, and medical education. The Fulbright University Vietnam (FUV) is a significant contribution by the US to Vietnam's development. With an investment of over $20 million from the US government, FUV will be the first independent, nonprofit university in Vietnam, promoting academic freedom, meritocracy, transparency, and equal access. The US has also provided assistance in medical education and emerging diseases through the IMPACT MED Alliance, which aims to improve the quality of medical education in Vietnam. Another initiative, the BUILD-IT Alliance, focuses on linking STEM education in Vietnamese universities with industry needs. The Fulbright Program has supported over 500 Americans and nearly 700 Vietnamese for study, research, and teaching since 1992. The Fulbright Economics Teaching Program, now a Master's degree program, has been instrumental in guiding Vietnam's economic development. The Vietnam Education Foundation (VEF) supports Vietnamese students studying science fields in the US. Currently, there are 19,000 Vietnamese students attending US universities, making Vietnam the 9th largest source of foreign students to the US worldwide.
