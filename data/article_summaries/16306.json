President Obama has used his authority under the Antiquities Act to establish the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument in southern California. This designation permanently protects 346,177 acres of national forest land, providing increased access and outdoor opportunities for residents in the area. The decision is supported by various communities and organizations, including business, tourism, environmental justice, conservation, academic, and cultural preservation groups. The monument designation will also create new opportunities for collaboration between the Forest Service and local communities to enhance outdoor opportunities and access. Leading philanthropies are committing funds to support restoration and stewardship projects in the monument and surrounding communities. The San Gabriel Mountains provide the only large-scale open space for many residents of Los Angeles County, which is one of the most disadvantaged counties in terms of access to parks and open spaces for minorities and children. The area is home to high-quality wilderness areas, rare and endangered animals, and cultural and historical features. President Obama has now protected more than 260 million acres of land and water, making him the President who has protected the most land and water since the Antiquities Act became law in 1906. The San Gabriel Mountains National Monument will be managed by the U.S. Forest Service.
