Anders Fogh Rasmussen's term as Secretary General of NATO has come to an end. During his tenure, he emphasized the importance of the transatlantic Alliance and worked with NATO Allies to address various security challenges, including the situations in Afghanistan, the Balkans, Libya, and Ukraine. Rasmussen played a critical role in guiding NATO's response to Russia's actions in Ukraine and the growing threat of ISIL in the Middle East. His strategic vision helped strengthen the Alliance's readiness to face any threat. Rasmussen also had a strong commitment to a peaceful and united Europe, based on shared values of freedom, democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and individual dignity. As he leaves his post, his friendship and selfless service to NATO are acknowledged and appreciated. Jens Stoltenberg, the former Norwegian Prime Minister, will succeed Rasmussen as Secretary General and is expected to bring energy, experience, and a commitment to defending values and maintaining security commitments. The President looks forward to working with Stoltenberg to address emerging challenges faced by the Alliance.
