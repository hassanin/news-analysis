The article discusses the extension of a national emergency declared by President Biden in relation to the Western Balkans. The original declaration was made in 2001 and was aimed at addressing the threat posed by extremist violence in the region. The declaration was subsequently amended in 2003 to include actions obstructing the implementation of certain agreements. In June 2021, President Biden signed an executive order expanding the scope of the national emergency, citing the undermining of post-war agreements, widespread corruption, and the hindrance of effective governance and integration into transatlantic institutions in the Western Balkans. The continuation of the national emergency beyond June 26, 2023, is deemed necessary due to ongoing threats to national security and foreign policy.
