Second Lady Karen Pence has unveiled the 2020 Christmas decorations at the Vice President's Residence, with the theme "Old Fashioned Christmas." The decorations highlight the simple joys and vintage feels of the holiday season, featuring natural elements like pine cones, seasonal berries, and grapevines, as well as rustic elements like burlap, galvanized aluminum, and lanterns. Traditional sleds, a toboggan, and gingerbread ornaments are also included. Devers Design in Arlington, Virginia assisted in the design and installation of the decorations, which took five days and involved the use of 600 yards of burlap and plaid ribbon, over 1,000 ornaments, 250 wrapped packages, and 35 wreaths. Outside the Residence, 500 yards of cedar garland and 130 velvet bows adorn the gates, while seven Christmas trees, provided by Wyckoff's Christmas Tree Farm LLC, are placed throughout the historic home. These trees are decorated with twinkle lights and Old Fashioned ornaments. Additionally, one Christmas tree is displayed outside the Residence with multi-color twinkle lights, and 700 yards of white twinkle lights are hung both inside and outside the Residence.
