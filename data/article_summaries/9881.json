President Barack Obama has proclaimed December 7th as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. On this day in 1941, the United States suffered a devastating attack at Pearl Harbor, resulting in the loss of thousands of lives and thrusting the country into World War II. The proclamation honors the patriots who perished in the attack, extends thoughts and prayers to their loved ones, and expresses gratitude to the service members who fought during that time. The proclamation encourages Americans to observe this day of remembrance and honor the military, past and present, through appropriate ceremonies and activities. It also calls for the flag of the United States to be flown at half-staff in honor of those who died at Pearl Harbor.
