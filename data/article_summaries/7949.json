President Biden held a call with Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm and the CEOs of Entergy and Southern Company to discuss the impact of Hurricane Ida on the energy delivery infrastructure in the Gulf Coast. They acknowledged the efforts to restore power but recognized that it will take time. The President pledged the full support of the Federal Government to expedite power restoration in Louisiana and Mississippi. The government is providing resources such as aerial and satellite imagery, assistance with debris removal and traffic control, restoration of communications infrastructure, and expediting permitting for transmission cable and towers. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) was also acknowledged for their crucial work during emergencies. Over 25,000 linemen from 32 states and the District of Columbia are on the ground to support damage assessment and restoration efforts. The President approved a Major Disaster Declaration for Louisiana and pre-disaster Emergency Declarations for both Louisiana and Mississippi. The CEOs emphasized the need for infrastructure policy and investments to strengthen the grid against climate change and extreme weather events. The President stressed the importance of broad support for his administration's infrastructure investment goals.
