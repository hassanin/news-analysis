On May 4, 2017, President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation declaring it the National Day of Prayer in the United States. In the proclamation, he highlighted the importance of prayer and giving thanks for blessings, as well as asking for wisdom, strength, and protection for the future. He emphasized that people of all faiths should be free to worship according to their consciences and practice their faith in both private and public settings without government coercion or discrimination. The proclamation also acknowledged the global threats to religious freedom and called for prayers for those who are persecuted for their beliefs. President Trump invited citizens to pray in accordance with their own faiths and consciences, expressing gratitude for the freedoms and blessings they have received, and seeking God's guidance and protection.
