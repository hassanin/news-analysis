The article discusses a bipartisan debt deal that was announced in 2011. The deal aimed to remove uncertainty over the economy by ensuring that the threat of default would not be used for political gain. It also included a down payment on deficit reduction through caps on discretionary spending, including savings from both domestic and Pentagon spending. The deal established a bipartisan committee to seek a balanced approach to larger deficit reduction through entitlement and tax reform. It also implemented an enforcement mechanism to incentivize bipartisan compromise on deficit reduction. The article emphasizes that the deal protected Social Security, Medicare beneficiaries, and low-income programs from any cuts, and stayed true to the President's commitment to shared sacrifice. The article outlines the mechanics of the debt deal, including the immediate enactment of discretionary spending caps and an increase in the debt limit. It also mentions the establishment of a committee to identify additional deficit reduction and an enforcement mechanism that would trigger spending reductions if the committee failed. The article concludes by stating that the deal is a balanced approach to deficit reduction and that the President rejected proposals that would have placed the burden of deficit reduction on low-income or middle-class families.
