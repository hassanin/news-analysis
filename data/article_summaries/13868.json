President Obama issued a statement on the passing of Jack Greenberg, recognizing his dedication to justice and his contributions to civil rights. Greenberg, the son of immigrants who fled anti-Semitism, believed in equality under the law for all Americans. As a leader of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, he followed in the footsteps of his mentor, Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, and worked to address the challenges of civil rights. Greenberg played a significant role in arguing the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case that desegregated schools and represented Dr. King in Birmingham Jail. He understood that change would take time and multiple efforts, but remained committed to the cause. President Obama and the First Lady offered their condolences to Greenberg's family and those who loved him.
