President Biden has announced a new target for the United States to achieve a 50-52 percent reduction in greenhouse gas pollution from 2005 levels by 2030. This announcement was made during the Leaders Summit on Climate and is part of Biden's focus on building back better and creating jobs while tackling the climate crisis. The United States aims to reach net zero emissions economy-wide by 2050. The target was developed through a whole-of-government process and takes into account the contributions of various sectors of the economy. It builds on the progress made by states, cities, tribes, and territories in reducing pollution. The target supports Biden's existing goals of a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035 and a net zero emissions economy by 2050. Achieving this target will create millions of good-paying, union jobs in sectors such as clean energy, infrastructure, transportation, and agriculture. The target is consistent with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The United States recognizes the urgency of addressing climate change and is committed to taking bold action to protect public health, promote environmental justice, and strengthen the economy.
