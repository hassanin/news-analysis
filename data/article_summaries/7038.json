April is National Donate Life Month in the United States. It is a time to celebrate the generosity of organ, eye, tissue, marrow, and blood donors, and to encourage more people to become donors. The month also includes National Pediatric Transplant Week, which aims to end the pediatric transplant waiting list. Despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 saw a record number of organ transplants from deceased donors for the 10th consecutive year. Over 39,000 transplants were performed in the US last year. However, there are still over 107,000 people on the national transplant waiting list, with a new person added every nine minutes. This includes more than 1,900 children under the age of 18. While small children usually require donations from other young children, older children and adults can often match. It is important for Americans from all communities to become donors, as minority groups make up nearly 60% of those waiting for a transplant. Blood stem cell transplantation is also crucial for many individuals, with over 65% requiring donors from outside their own family. Although there are currently 30 million registered blood stem cell donors, more registrants are needed to meet the demand. Every day, 17 people in America die while waiting for a transplant. One donor has the potential to save up to eight lives through organ donation and improve another 75 lives through eye and tissue donation. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed April 2021 as National Donate Life Month and calls upon every person to become organ, eye, tissue, marrow, and blood donors to give hope to those in need of a life-saving or life-enhancing transplant.
