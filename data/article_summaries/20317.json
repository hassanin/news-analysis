President Obama released a statement expressing his satisfaction with the agreement reached by Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate regarding Medicare payments to doctors. The legislation aims to prevent a significant pay cut for doctors and ensure that seniors on Medicare can continue to see their trusted physicians. The President urges Congress to act quickly on this proposal, emphasizing the need for a permanent solution rather than temporary fixes. He looks forward to working with Congress in the coming year to address this matter conclusively.
