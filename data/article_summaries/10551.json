The article is a Q&A with First Lady Michelle Obama about the impact of arts in schools and her efforts to promote arts education. The Turnaround Arts program, which introduces arts in schools, has shown positive effects on attendance, behavior, grades, and parental engagement. Kids involved in the arts tend to have better grades and fewer behavioral problems. The arts also help to get students excited about other subjects like math, reading, and science. The President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities will be partnering with the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts to expand the Turnaround Arts program. Michelle Obama's artistic legacy is one of openness, inclusion, and inspiration for young people. She has hosted various performances at the White House and has workshops for young people, especially those from underserved communities. Michelle Obama believes that theatre, like the musical Hamilton, has the power to bring history to life and get young people excited about learning. She also emphasizes the importance of giving all young people access to theatre and the arts. She encourages everyday citizens to support the arts in their communities by embracing arts in classrooms, encouraging kids to get involved, donating money and supplies, speaking out for arts education, and attending performances and exhibits.
