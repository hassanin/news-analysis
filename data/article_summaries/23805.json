The United States has committed to donating up to $4.3 billion to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria through 2019. They will match one dollar for every two dollars in pledges made by other donors until September 30th, 2017. The goal is to reach a total of $13 billion in funding by 2019, which will help prevent 300 million new infections and save 8 million lives from HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis by 2020. The United States has already made significant progress in fighting these diseases, with an estimated 6 million lives saved from malaria and 43 million lives saved from tuberculosis since 2000. However, there is still work to be done, especially in areas of conflict. The United States believes that now is the time to accelerate efforts and make smart investments in at-risk places. They are committed to continuing the fight and believe that together, the world can eliminate these diseases and save millions of lives.
