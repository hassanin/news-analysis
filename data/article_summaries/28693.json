Vice President Mike Pence welcomes various organizations to the White House to discuss the repeal and replacement of Obamacare. He urges members of Congress to vote to begin the debate on the issue, stating that inaction is not an option. Pence highlights the broken promises of Obamacare, such as being able to keep doctors and health insurance plans, and the increasing costs and limited choices for Americans. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price, emphasizes the need for healthcare decisions to be in the hands of patients, not the government. Both Pence and Price express gratitude for the support of the organizations present and call on them to help spread the message to the American people that it is time for Congress to act. They believe that with the support of the majority in the Senate, legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare can be passed.
