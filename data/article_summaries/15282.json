The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a statement by Press Secretary Jay Carney on September 25, 2013. Carney announced a new report released by the Department of Health and Human Services showing that the Affordable Care Act will make health insurance more affordable and accessible for Americans. The report states that premiums will be around 16 percent lower than originally expected, with about 95 percent of eligible uninsured Americans living in states with lower-than-expected premiums. Carney also discussed President Obama's interest in resolving the conflict with Iran diplomatically and the need for Iran to demonstrate seriousness in negotiations over its nuclear weapons program. He emphasized that actions are what matter and that substantive negotiations will be the test of Iran's seriousness. Carney also addressed the government shutdown and debt ceiling debates, stating that Congress needs to act responsibly and fulfill its obligation to ensure that the government does not shut down and that the United States does not default on its debts. He reiterated that the President will not negotiate over Congress's responsibility to raise the debt ceiling. Carney mentioned that Chief of Staff Denis McDonough will be going up to the Hill to confer with Democrats about the budget issues. He also discussed the recent terror attack in Kenya and the President's concerns about the creeping resignation that these tragedies are becoming the new normal. Carney stated that the President is pursuing actions to reduce gun violence in America and will continue to push that agenda.
