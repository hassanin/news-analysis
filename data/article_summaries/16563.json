The article is a letter from former President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House and the President, stating his decision to continue the national emergency with respect to Venezuela. The letter cites the ongoing issues in Venezuela, including the erosion of human rights, persecution of political opponents, curtailment of press freedoms, violence and human rights violations in response to protests, and government corruption. Obama states that these reasons justify the need to extend the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692.
