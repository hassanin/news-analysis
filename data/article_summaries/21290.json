This memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama on September 15, 2011, addresses the issue of Icelandic whaling activities and their impact on the International Whaling Commission's conservation program. Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke had previously certified that these activities were diminishing the effectiveness of the program. In response, President Obama directs relevant U.S. officials to raise concerns with Icelandic officials and seek ways to halt commercial whaling by Icelandic companies. Cabinet secretaries are instructed to evaluate the appropriateness of visits to Iceland based on the continuation of the suspension of fin whaling. The Department of State is tasked with examining Arctic cooperation projects and potentially linking U.S. cooperation to Iceland's change in whaling policy. The Departments of Commerce and State are directed to consult with other international actors to end Icelandic commercial whaling. The U.S. will continue to monitor the activities of Icelandic companies engaged in commercial whaling, and relevant agencies are instructed to explore additional response options. The Secretaries of State and Commerce are expected to review the situation and urge Iceland to cease its commercial whaling activities. Departments and agencies are required to report on their actions within 6 months or upon the resumption of fin whaling by Icelandic nationals. These actions aim to reduce Iceland's commercial whaling activities and support broader conservation efforts.
