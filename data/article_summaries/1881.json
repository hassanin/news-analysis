On September 17, 2021, President Biden convened the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF) to strengthen climate ambition ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP 26). The participants emphasized the importance of keeping the 1.5 degree Celsius limit within reach and achieving global net zero emissions by mid-century. They also announced their support for a Global Methane Pledge, which aims to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30 percent below 2020 levels by 2030. Several countries, including the United States, European Union, Argentina, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, and the United Kingdom, expressed their intention to join the pledge. The meeting also highlighted the need for a successful COP 26 that includes strong outcomes on adaptation and finance. President Biden plans to use the MEF as a platform to facilitate targeted endeavors and accelerate concrete action on climate change. The United States will initiate these efforts with a meeting of MEF ministers in January 2022 to discuss clean energy goals in various sectors.
