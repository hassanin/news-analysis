The White House has announced that the national emergency with respect to Iran, which was declared in 1995, will continue beyond March 15, 2016. This declaration is in accordance with Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act. Despite the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) reached in 2015, which aimed to ensure Iran's nuclear program remains peaceful, the US believes that certain actions and policies of the Iranian government still pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Although nuclear-related sanctions have been lifted, non-nuclear related sanctions against Iran will remain in place.
