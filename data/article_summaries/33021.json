On January 28, 2019, President Donald J. Trump issued executive orders regarding foreign policy. The orders were issued in response to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13692 of March 8, 2015, and subsequent actions taken in Executive Orders 13808, 13827, 13835, and 13850. The orders aim to address human rights violations and abuses by persons affiliated with the Maduro regime in Venezuela, including the curtailment of press freedom, arbitrary arrest and detention of protestors, harassment of political opponents, and attempts to undermine the Interim President and the National Assembly. The amendments made to the previous executive orders broaden the definition of the "Government of Venezuela" to include various entities and individuals associated with the Maduro regime. The orders also clarify that they do not affect the authority of executive departments or agencies, the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, or create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities. The orders are to be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to available appropriations.
