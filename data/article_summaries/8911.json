The President is taking steps to address the rising gas prices caused by Putin's Price Hike and the impact of war on global fuel supply. The Environmental Protection Agency has issued an emergency fuel waiver to allow the sale of E15 during the summer driving season. This waiver aims to address the fuel supply crisis and aligns with President Biden's plan to increase the use of biofuels, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, support American agriculture and manufacturing, and save money at the pump. E15 can save families an average of 10 cents per gallon of gas, and the waiver will allow this lower price to continue for months. Furthermore, the President has authorized the largest release in history from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, worked to build a global coalition for an additional 60 million barrels, and is urging Congress to impose fees on unused oil wells to encourage domestic production. The administration has also finalized strong fuel economy standards for vehicles, reducing the need for fuel and increasing efficiency.
