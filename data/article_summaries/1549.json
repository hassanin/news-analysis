President Biden, Prime Minister Albanese, and Prime Minister Kishida have reaffirmed their commitment to working together with Indo-Pacific partners to meet their needs for high-quality, sustainable infrastructure. At the G20 Summit's Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) event, it was announced that the United States International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) will provide USD50 million each in credit guarantees for Export Finance Australia's (EFA) financing package. This package was provided to support Telstra's acquisition of Digicel Pacific, the leading telecommunications operator in the Pacific with over 2.5 million subscribers in various countries. The investment aims to improve security, performance, and affordability of mobile voice and data services in the Pacific region. The project aligns with the PGII and the Partners of the Blue Pacific initiative, both established this year. It also demonstrates adherence to the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment, promoting socially inclusive, resilient, and environmentally friendly infrastructure. The support for this project builds on the shared commitment to address the infrastructure needs of the region through the Trilateral Infrastructure Partnership (TIP).
