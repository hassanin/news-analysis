President Joe Biden met with George Floyd's family in the Oval Office, marking one year since Floyd's murder. The family, like any family experiencing a profound loss, still feels the pain as if they received the news just moments ago. They have had to relive the grief each time the horrific 9 minutes and 29 seconds of Floyd's murder have been replayed. Despite this, the Floyd family has shown extraordinary courage, particularly Floyd's young daughter, Gianna. Last year, she told Biden that her father had changed the world.

Floyd's murder sparked protests across the country, reminiscent of the Civil Rights era, as people from all races and generations came together to condemn senseless killings. The recent conviction of the police officer responsible for Floyd's murder was an important step toward justice. However, Biden emphasizes that progress cannot stop there.

To bring about real change, there must be accountability when law enforcement officers violate their oaths, and trust needs to be built between the police and the communities they serve. Biden supports the ongoing negotiations on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act in Congress and hopes for a meaningful bill to be passed quickly. He believes that America is at an inflection point, where the battle for the country's soul between the ideal of equality and the reality of racism needs to be won by the American ideal.

In summary, President Biden met with George Floyd's family, acknowledging the pain they still feel one year after Floyd's murder. He calls for accountability and trust in the justice system and supports the ongoing efforts to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Biden sees this moment as crucial in the fight against racism and the pursuit of equality in America.
