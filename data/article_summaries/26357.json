Fact checkers have called out attacks on Judge Kavanaugh as false. The Washington Post and Politifact both addressed the claim that Kavanaugh referred to birth control as "abortion-inducing drugs" during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing. They concluded that the claim was taken out of context and misrepresented Kavanaugh's statement. Kavanaugh was actually quoting the views of the plaintiffs in a case, not expressing his personal opinion. Both articles gave Four Pinocchios and a False rating to Senator Kamala Harris for spreading the misleading claim. Additionally, an article in Above the Law defended Kavanaugh against accusations of lying under oath, stating that the claims lack merit and are unfair attacks on his character.
