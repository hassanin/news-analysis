On Law Day, President Donald Trump emphasizes the importance of the rule of law and the Constitution. He highlights that the rule of law requires that everyone is subject to the law and protected by it, serving as a protection against the arbitrary use of government power. Trump mentions that the Founding Fathers believed in a government of laws, not of individuals, and that the Constitution granted limited power to the Federal Government, with the rest left to the States. He also discusses the separation of powers, which has helped maintain the rule of law and protect liberty. Trump expresses concerns about improper injunctions issued by Federal district courts, which he believes undermine the separation of powers. He mentions efforts to eliminate unnecessary and burdensome regulations and to ensure that public universities uphold the First Amendment. Trump urges all Americans to appreciate how the rule of law protects their rights and acknowledges the sacrifices made by previous generations to secure and defend these rights. He proclaims May 1, 2019, as Law Day, U.S.A., and encourages Americans to reflect on the importance of the rule of law and display the flag in support of this observance. He also calls on the legal profession, the press, and the media industries to promote and participate in this day.
