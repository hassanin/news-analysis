President Obama has declared a major disaster in Alaska and ordered federal aid to assist with recovery efforts after flooding in the Kenai Peninsula Borough from October 27-28, 2013. Federal funding will be available to state, tribal, and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and repairing or replacing damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding. Dolph A. Diemont has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
