President Donald J. Trump is grateful for the support of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the full Senate in confirming General H.R. McMaster as his National Security Advisor. McMaster's extensive overseas experience and distinguished career make him well-suited to advise the President on various global challenges. The Senate's bipartisan support confirms that McMaster is the right person for the job.
