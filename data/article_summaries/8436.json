Sixty years after the signing of the Equal Pay Act, President Joe Biden emphasizes the need to continue the fight for equal pay. While progress has been made, with the gender pay gap narrowing from 59 cents in 1963 to 84 cents in 2021 for women working full-time, year-round compared to men, disparities still exist, especially for women of color and women with disabilities. To address this, President Biden has issued Executive Orders to advance pay equity for the Federal workforce and promote pay equity for job applicants and employees of Federal contractors. He has also taken steps to make child care and long-term care more accessible and affordable, particularly for women who often face caregiving challenges that affect their earnings. President Biden calls on Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to increase pay transparency, strengthen protections against discrimination, and promote equality for women and people of color. He remains committed to creating an economy that works for everyone and ensuring equal protection under the law.
