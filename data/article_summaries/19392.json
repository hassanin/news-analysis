This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran, which was declared in 1995, will continue for another year. The President issued several Executive Orders in response to the actions and policies of the Government of Iran, and these measures are deemed necessary due to the ongoing threat they pose to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The renewal of the national emergency is separate from previous renewals and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress. The notice is signed by President Barack Obama.
