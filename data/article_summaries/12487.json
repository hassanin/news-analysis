On April 11, 2013, President Barack Obama awarded Chaplain (Captain) Emil J. Kapaun, U.S. Army, the Medal of Honor for his courageous actions during combat operations in Korea in 1950. Chaplain Kapaun provided comfort and medical aid to his comrades under heavy enemy fire and chose to stay behind with the wounded when others were ordered to evacuate. He continued to make rounds and even convinced an injured Chinese officer to negotiate the safe surrender of American forces. After his capture, Chaplain Kapaun saved a comrade's life by pushing aside an enemy soldier preparing to execute him. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who display exceptional bravery and self-sacrifice beyond the call of duty.
