Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue and other members of President Donald Trump's Cabinet have held the first meeting of the Interagency Task Force on Agriculture and Rural Prosperity. The Task Force was created to address the challenges faced by rural America, which has not recovered as well as other parts of the country from the recent recession. The Task Force aims to improve the quality of life in rural areas, develop a reliable workforce, promote innovation and technology, and reduce regulations to enable growth. President Trump has asked for a report with specific recommendations within 180 days.
