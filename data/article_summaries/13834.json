The White House Council on Women and Girls, in collaboration with the Anna Julia Cooper Center at Wake Forest University, hosted a forum on Advancing Equity for Women and Girls of Color. The forum aimed to empower and increase opportunities for women and girls of color and their peers. The Council released a progress report, "Advancing Equity for Women and Girls of Color," and announced independent commitments to close opportunity gaps faced by women and girls of color. The Council identified five data-driven issue areas where interventions can promote opportunities for success: fostering school success and reducing unnecessary exclusionary school discipline, meeting the needs of vulnerable and striving youth, inclusive STEM education, sustaining reduced rates of teen pregnancy, and economic prosperity. The Administration has taken various steps to address these issues, such as supporting school discipline practices that promote safe and positive learning environments, enhancing programmatic responses for vulnerable youth, and encouraging STEM participation by highlighting accomplishments of girls and women from diverse communities. The Administration has also worked towards sustaining reduced rates of teen pregnancy and increasing economic prosperity for women of color through initiatives such as the Teen Pregnancy Prevention program and supporting tax credits for working Americans. The White House has been committed to increasing access to federal contracting opportunities for minority women-owned businesses and promoting diverse participation in career and technical training. Research and data are essential in creating pathways for success, and the Collaborative to Advance Equity through Research will play a key role in supporting this effort. Overall, the Council on Women and Girls aims to ensure that government policies address the challenges and opportunity gaps faced by women and girls of color, and inspire the private sector to do the same.
