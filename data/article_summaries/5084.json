The article discusses the release of historic industrial base reports by seven federal agencies, which marks the completion of a year-long effort to strengthen America's supply chains. The initiative was launched by President Biden through Executive Order 14017, which aimed to assess vulnerabilities and enhance the resilience of critical supply chains in the United States. Within six months, the administration completed a comprehensive review of supply chains for four critical products and established a Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force (SCDTF) to address challenges arising from the pandemic.

The actions taken have contributed to a significant recovery in American manufacturing and industrial strength. During President Biden's first year in office, the economy added 367,000 manufacturing jobs, the most in nearly 30 years. Manufacturing as a share of the GDP returned to pre-pandemic levels, and major investments in American manufacturing were announced. American ports also experienced record cargo movement, and retail inventories saw a surge, ensuring well-stocked shelves for a record-breaking holiday season. These achievements have contributed to the fastest job growth and economic growth in decades, surpassing other G7 countries.

On the one-year anniversary of the executive order, seven cabinet agencies published reports identifying weaknesses in crucial supply chains and proposing multi-year strategies to address them. The White House also published a capstone report summarizing the actions taken by the Biden-Harris Administration to reduce vulnerability in key sectors. In the coming months, federal departments and agencies will host regional summits to align regional economic development strategies with the national supply chain strategy.

Building on the conclusions of these reports, the Biden-Harris Administration announced additional actions to enhance long-term resilience across critical supply chains. The implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) is central to this effort, as it represents the most significant investment in modernizing transportation systems that support supply chains. The landmark America COMPETES Act, the United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA), and President Biden's Build Back Better Agenda will further strengthen supply chains, promote domestic manufacturing, and enhance the workforce.

The administration plans to institutionalize supply chain resilience throughout the federal government. The Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force has already fostered collaboration between agencies to respond to disruptions, and efforts are underway to formalize this resilience. The Department of Energy (DOE) has realigned resources to deploy over $60 billion in BIL funding for clean energy infrastructure. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has established a dedicated office for public health industrial base expansion and supply chain management. The Department of Transportation (DOT) will work with states to incorporate supply chain resilience in their State Freight Plans.

To build on these efforts, the Biden-Harris Administration emphasizes the need for comprehensive competitiveness legislation like the COMPETES/USICA bills to strengthen supply chains, promote domestic manufacturing, and outcompete China. These legislative measures, combined with investments from the Build Back Better Act, aim to expand the economy's productive capacity and lower costs for families.
