President Obama met with the Council of the Great City Schools to discuss the progress being made in education at the local level. He mentioned improved reading and math scores, increased graduation rates, and the turnaround of previously low-performing schools. However, he emphasized that this progress requires resources and expressed concern about the Republican budget, which may maintain sequester-level funding. He also highlighted the need to provide resources to the poorest school districts, focus on low-performing schools, assess student performance annually, set high standards, invest in special education and English learning, and provide resources to teachers and principals. President Obama urged the continuation of progress and emphasized the importance of education for the next generation.
