The article discusses the unprecedented mental health crisis among young people in the United States, which has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. President Biden has proposed a comprehensive national strategy to address this crisis and transform how mental health is understood and accessed. The Biden-Harris Administration has announced two new actions to strengthen school-based mental health services and address the youth mental health crisis. Firstly, they will disburse nearly $300 million to schools to hire more school-based mental health professionals and build a strong pipeline into the profession. This is part of a larger investment of $1 billion over the next five years. Secondly, the Departments of Education and Health and Human Services are encouraging governors to invest more in school-based mental health services, highlighting federal resources available to states and schools. Additionally, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act has authorized an additional $1.7 billion for mental health in schools and communities. These actions build upon previous investments made by the Biden-Harris Administration to expand access to mental health services for youth.
