President Obama has authorized an increase in federal funding for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in response to Typhoon Soudelor. The major disaster declaration issued on August 5, 2015, provided federal funding for Public Assistance, Hazard Mitigation, and Other Needs Assistance at 75% of eligible costs. The President's order today increases the federal share to 90% of the total eligible costs. For more information, contact the FEMA news desk.
