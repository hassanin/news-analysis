In this letter, President Barack Obama urges Congressional leaders to eliminate tax breaks for the oil and gas industry and use that revenue to invest in clean energy. He highlights that high oil and gas prices are burdening American families and slowing down economic growth. The President argues that eliminating these subsidies is necessary as the oil and gas industry already makes significant profits and high oil prices provide enough incentive for investment without special tax breaks. He expresses hope that both parties can come together to address this issue. Additionally, he emphasizes the need for a comprehensive energy strategy to reduce dependence on foreign oil and vulnerability to price fluctuations. President Obama outlines his Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future, which includes safe and responsible production of domestic oil and gas resources, increased fuel efficiency, and investment in renewable energy sources. He concludes by stressing the importance of investing in a clean energy economy to keep America competitive and reduce dependence on foreign oil.
