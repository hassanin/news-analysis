President Obama has announced plans to reform the U.S. export control system in order to strengthen national security and the competitiveness of key U.S. manufacturing and technology sectors. The current system is overly complicated and contains redundancies that diminish the ability to focus on critical national security priorities. The proposed changes include streamlining control lists, applying new criteria for determining controlled items, and creating a tiered system to distinguish different levels of control. The goal is to focus resources on protecting the most critical items and technologies. The administration also plans to enhance enforcement efforts, establish an Export Enforcement Coordination Center, and transition to a single information technology system for administering the export control system. The proposed revisions to control lists and licensing policies will be issued later this year.
