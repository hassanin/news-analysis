President Obama has unveiled a new initiative called ConnectED, which aims to connect 99% of America's students to high-speed broadband and high-speed wireless within 5 years. The President is calling on the FCC to modernize and leverage its existing E-Rate program to achieve this goal. The initiative also focuses on getting Internet connectivity and educational technology into classrooms, as well as providing training to teachers. ConnectED does not require Congressional action and relies on the support of businesses, states, districts, schools, and communities. The initiative aims to prepare students with the necessary skills to compete globally and emphasizes the importance of interactive, individualized learning experiences driven by technology. ConnectED will also benefit rural communities that have lacked connectivity. The initiative also aims to involve the private sector in providing new technologies and digital learning content to students. The Administration has been working to increase broadband access across the country over the past four years, and ConnectED builds upon these efforts.
