President Obama has announced the selection of a North Carolina-based consortium of businesses and universities to lead a manufacturing innovation institute for next-generation power electronics. The institute aims to make wide bandgap semiconductor technologies cost-competitive with current silicon-based power electronics within the next five years. This will result in power electronic devices, such as motors and consumer electronics, becoming faster, smaller, and more efficient. The Department of Energy is awarding $70 million over five years, matched by at least $70 million in non-federal commitments, to fund the institute. The President envisions a network of up to 45 manufacturing innovation institutes, which will require legislation from Congress. Two additional institutes, focused on digital manufacturing and design innovation and lightweight and modern metals manufacturing, are still in the selection process and will be awarded in the coming weeks. These institutes aim to bridge the gap between applied research and product development, bringing together companies, universities, and federal agencies to invest in technology areas that encourage investment and production in the United States.
