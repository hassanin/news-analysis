President Biden has declared a major disaster in the state of Maine due to severe storm and flooding from April 30 to May 1, 2023. Federal assistance will be provided to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in affected areas. The declaration allows for federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. William F. Roy of FEMA has been appointed to coordinate federal recovery operations. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
