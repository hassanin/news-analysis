This article is a presidential proclamation by Barack Obama, the President of the United States, regarding modifications to the duty-free treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and other purposes. The proclamation states that Argentina's designation as a beneficiary developing country under the GSP is suspended due to its failure to enforce arbitral awards in favor of US citizens. The Republic of South Sudan is designated as a beneficiary developing country and a least-developed beneficiary developing country under the GSP. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) is modified to reflect these changes. Additionally, the HTS is modified to implement provisions of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) and to reflect amendments to the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act. Technical corrections are also made to ensure conformity with the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. The modifications to the HTS mentioned in the proclamation have specific effective dates.
