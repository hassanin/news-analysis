This memorandum, issued by President Joseph R. Biden Jr., establishes uniform standards for tribal consultation to strengthen the government-to-government relationship between the United States and American Indian and Alaska Native Tribal Nations. The memorandum acknowledges the unique legal relationship between the United States and Tribal Nations and emphasizes the importance of consultation, self-governance, and Tribal sovereignty. It requires each agency to designate a point of contact for tribal consultation matters and outlines the principles and processes for conducting consultations, including providing notice, considering tribal input, and maintaining a record of the consultation process. The memorandum also emphasizes the training of agency employees on tribal consultation and allows agencies to set more specific or stringent standards if desired.
