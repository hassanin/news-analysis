President Obama has announced plans for the creation of a new, national Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) Master Teacher Corps. The Corps will consist of exceptional STEM teachers who will make a multi-year commitment and receive an annual stipend of up to $20,000 on top of their base salary. The goal is to recognize and reward leading educators in STEM subjects and strengthen STEM education in public schools. Additionally, the President will dedicate $100 million to supporting STEM teachers through the Teacher Incentive Fund. The Administration plans to launch the STEM Master Teacher Corps with $1 billion from the President's 2013 budget request.
