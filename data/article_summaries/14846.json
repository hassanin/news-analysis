The article is a fact sheet about the High-Speed Intercity Passenger Rail Program for the Pontiac-Detroit-Chicago corridor. The program aims to improve rail service between these cities, as well as connect neighboring states. The total funding for the entire corridor is approximately $244 million. The corridor will have upgraded tracks spanning 300 miles. The project includes renovations to existing stations in Michigan, the construction of a new station in downtown Dearborn, and the building of a flyover, approach bridges, embankment, and retaining walls in Illinois. In Indiana, the project focuses on the most congested and delay-prone corridor in the country, with improvements such as track relocation, reconfiguration, and addition, as well as signal system improvements and the creation of a new passing track. These investments aim to reduce congestion, increase speeds, and improve service reliability for passengers. The long-term vision for the corridor includes doubling the number of daily round trips between Detroit and Chicago and increasing speeds to 110 mph.
