In this press gaggle, Principal Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest announces that the First Lady will be addressing a conference on childhood obesity and discussing the progress made by the "Let's Move" campaign. Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will also be announcing new steps to encourage doctors and hospitals to implement health care information technology. The President is traveling to Scranton, Pennsylvania to urge Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in ensuring that taxes don't go up on 160 million Americans. There is a proposal to extend and expand the payroll tax cut, which would save Pennsylvanians $7.8 billion next year. Republicans have been opposing measures to increase taxes on millionaires and billionaires, but the President is calling on them to protect the tax cuts of working Americans. There is also discussion about the role of the President in prodding world central banks to take action, the closure of the British embassy in Iran, and the decision to delay the Keystone pipeline. The President's visit to Scranton is seen as an effort to appeal to conservative, white, working-class voters. There is also mention of the President's fundraisers in New York and his commitment to vetoing any solution that may come out of discussions on the sequestration.
