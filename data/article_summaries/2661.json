President Biden held a meeting with a bipartisan group of senators and House members to address the resilience and reliability of critical supply chains. The goal is to ensure that the American people never face shortages in goods and services they rely on. The President emphasized the need to protect and provide for the American people during national emergencies without relying on foreign countries. He signed an executive order to address vulnerabilities in supply chains across critical sectors of the economy and to invest in domestic manufacturing capacity. The President also highlighted the importance of securing and diversifying supply chains, particularly in areas such as semiconductors, minerals, pharmaceuticals, and advanced batteries. A 100-day review will be conducted on these four vital products, and a long-term review of six sectors of the economy will be initiated to identify policy recommendations and fortify supply chains. The administration will work with various stakeholders to implement these recommendations. President Biden expressed optimism about the bipartisan cooperation in strengthening supply chains and indicated that he will be speaking with the King of Saudi Arabia. He confirmed that he has read the Jamal Khashoggi report from the ODNI.
