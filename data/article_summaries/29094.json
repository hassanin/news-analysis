In this proclamation issued by President Donald J. Trump, he recognizes National Foster Care Month and highlights the dedication of foster and kinship caregivers, faith-based and community organizations, and child welfare professionals who improve the lives of children in foster care. The President emphasizes the importance of providing stable and nurturing homes for these children and expresses gratitude for the sacrifices made by foster families. He acknowledges the need to prevent abuse and neglect that lead to foster care placements, particularly due to the opioid crisis and drug abuse. The President mentions the Family First Prevention Services Act, a law aimed at keeping children at home and out of foster care by providing funding for substance abuse prevention and treatment, mental health services, family counseling, and parenting-skills training. The law also encourages the placement of children in family atmospheres rather than congregate care. President Trump calls upon all Americans to observe National Foster Care Month by helping children and youth in foster care and recognizing the commitment of foster parents and caregivers.
