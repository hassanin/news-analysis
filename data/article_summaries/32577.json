President Donald Trump has signed into law the "Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020," which provides more flexibility for small businesses to use federal loans under the Paycheck Protection Program. The Act allows businesses, such as restaurants and hotels, to use these loans to cover payroll, employee benefits, and other expenses during the coronavirus outbreak. However, President Trump expressed concern about the constitutionality of the Act due to the House of Representatives' use of a proxy voting system, which allowed members to vote on behalf of absent colleagues. He urges Congress to pass the Act again through traditional in-person voting.
