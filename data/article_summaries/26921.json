On April 18, 2019, the President signed H.R. 1839, the "Medicaid Services Investment and Accountability Act of 2019". This law brings about several changes to Medicaid authorities. It imposes penalties on manufacturers who misclassify drugs, expands a State option for health homes for children with complex medical conditions, extends and provides additional funding for certain Medicaid demonstration projects, and modifies other Medicaid funding and billing provisions.
