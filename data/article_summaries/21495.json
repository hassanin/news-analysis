Vice President Biden and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan have introduced comprehensive guidance to help schools, colleges, and universities understand their obligations under federal civil rights laws to prevent and respond to campus sexual assault. The guidance clarifies the legal obligations under Title IX for educational institutions receiving federal funds to effectively respond to sexual violence. It also provides practical examples to aid educators in ensuring student safety. The guidance emphasizes that discrimination under Title IX includes sexual violence such as rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, and sexual coercion. It details enforcement strategies for schools and the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights to end sexual violence, prevent its recurrence, and address its effects. The Vice President and Secretary of Education aim to create a safe learning environment for all students and raise awareness about sexual violence. Vice President Biden has been a long-time advocate for combating violence against women, and the guidance reflects the Administration's commitment to preventing sexual violence against women of all ages. The full text of the guidance and additional resources can be found on the Department of Education's website.
