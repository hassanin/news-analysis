According to the annual United States Government estimate, poppy cultivation in Afghanistan decreased by 33% in 2018 compared to 2017, but still remained at a near record high. Similarly, potential pure opium production dropped by 42%. These declines are attributed to drought and low opium prices. However, the large-scale cultivation and production of poppy in Afghanistan complicates the government's ability to maintain rule of law and promote peace. The drug revenue generated by the Taliban also hinders counterterrorism efforts. Although Afghanistan's heroin is not the main cause of the United States opioid epidemic, it affects the citizens of Afghanistan and countries along drug trafficking routes. The United States Government plans to continue working with the government of Afghanistan to address this issue.
