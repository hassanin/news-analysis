On National Atomic Veterans Day, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. recognizes and honors the contributions of American military service members who participated in nuclear tests between 1945 and 1962, served in or around Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or were held as prisoners of war in or near Hiroshima or Nagasaki. These veterans, known as "Atomic Veterans," served at testing sites like the Bikini Atoll and witnessed the destructive power of nuclear weapons firsthand. Many Atomic Veterans developed health conditions due to radiation exposure, but were unable to seek medical care or disability compensation because they were not allowed to discuss the nature of their service. In 1996, the United States Congress repealed the Nuclear Radiation and Secrecy Agreements Act, allowing Atomic Veterans to tell their stories and file for benefits. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of properly preparing and caring for troops and their families. President Biden calls upon all Americans to observe National Atomic Veterans Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor the bravery and devotion to duty of these veterans.
