Jared Bernstein, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers, spoke on Fox News Sunday about the strong state of the labor market and the need to bring down prices, particularly for prescription drugs. He highlighted that Americans often pay much more for the same drugs compared to Europeans and emphasized bipartisan support for addressing this issue. Bernstein also discussed the importance of a strong labor market in supporting consumer spending and mentioned the record-breaking job growth under President Biden. He acknowledged that wage growth is strong in nominal terms but is being offset by high inflation. Bernstein called for action from Congress to make prescription drugs more affordable and lower health insurance premiums, noting that this has been a shared goal across both parties, including former President Trump. He argued that lowering drug costs not only benefits individuals but also saves Medicare $100 billion over ten years.
