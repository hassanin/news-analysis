The President of the United States, Barack Obama, has sent a message to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Belarus will continue beyond June 16, 2013. This national emergency was declared in 2006 due to the actions and policies of certain members of the Belarusian government and other individuals who undermine democratic processes and institutions in Belarus. The government of Belarus has been cracking down on political opposition, civil society, and independent media, and the 2012 elections failed to meet international standards. The government has arrested and imprisoned citizens for criticizing officials and participating in demonstrations, and has also restricted independent media. These actions demonstrate that Belarus has not made progress in democratic governance and human rights. The President believes that the actions and policies of the Belarusian government and others continue to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and therefore, the national emergency needs to be extended.
