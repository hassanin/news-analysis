The Biden-Harris Administration is announcing new actions and private commitments to enhance the cybersecurity of schools in the United States. There has been a rise in cyberattacks targeting schools, with at least eight K-12 school districts being impacted in the 2022-23 academic year. These attacks have disrupted school operations and compromised sensitive personal information of students and employees. To address this issue, Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, and First Lady Jill Biden are convening school administrators, educators, and private sector companies to discuss best practices and resources for strengthening school cybersecurity. According to a report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the loss of learning following a cyberattack can range from three days to three weeks, with recovery taking up to nine months. The monetary losses to school districts can range from $50,000 to $1 million. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to securing the nation's critical infrastructure and providing resources to help school districts protect against cyberattacks. The administration is taking additional action and committing resources to strengthen the cybersecurity of K-12 school systems, including providing federal grants, improving incident response, and offering training and technical assistance. Education technology providers are also committing to providing free and low-cost resources to school districts. These efforts aim to ensure that schools are better equipped to protect their networks and keep students, educators, and employees safe.
