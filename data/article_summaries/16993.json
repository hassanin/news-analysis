President Obama welcomed more than 50 top CEOs to the White House Forum on Modernizing Government. The forum aimed to learn from those in the private sector who are using technology to save money and improve performance. The government has a lot to learn from the private sector, particularly in terms of information technology. One specific problem is the technology gap between the public and private sectors, which leads to waste, slow customer service, and a lack of transparency. The forum focused on streamlining government operations, improving customer service, and maximizing return on IT investments. After the forum, the White House will seek ideas from the public on how the government can improve its use of technology. The forum is part of a larger effort to streamline the federal government and eliminate wasteful practices.
