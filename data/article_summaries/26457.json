President Trump recently gave a commencement address to graduates of the "Hope for Prisoners" program in Las Vegas. He emphasized the importance of redemption and second chances for former inmates as they reintegrate into society. President Trump is known for his championing of criminal justice reform, having signed the First Step Act in 2018, which reformed sentencing guidelines and invested in prisoner rehabilitation programs. He also highlighted the administration's efforts to promote Second Chance Hiring, encouraging businesses to hire all Americans. The strong labor market under the Trump administration has led to record job openings and the addition of over 7 million jobs to the economy. This has resulted in significant increases in net worth for the bottom 50 percent of American households, surpassing the rate of increase for the top 1 percent.
