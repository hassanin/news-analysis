President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed September 11, 2023, as Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance. This day commemorates the heroes who demonstrated extraordinary courage and selflessness in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. It honors the civilians, service members, and first responders who risked and lost their lives to save others. The bravery and resolve of individuals on Flight 93, as well as the police officers, firefighters, and volunteers who worked tirelessly at Ground Zero and the Pentagon, are recognized. The President calls upon all departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States to display the flag at half-staff and encourages the participation of the American people in community service, remembrance services, and a moment of silence at 8:46 a.m. eastern daylight time to honor the innocent victims of the attacks.
