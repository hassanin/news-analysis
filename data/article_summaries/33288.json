The United States economy added 1.8 million jobs in July, surpassing expectations for the third consecutive month. In total, the economy has added 9.3 million jobs in the past three months, exceeding market expectations by 12 million. The unemployment rate in July was 10.2 percent, down from a high of 14.7 percent three months ago. Historically disadvantaged groups, such as Black Americans, have seen significant job gains, with nearly a million new jobs since April and a decrease in the unemployment rate. Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans also experienced declines in their unemployment rates. Industries that suffered the most job losses, such as leisure and hospitality and retail trade, have shown strong recoveries. However, there is still work to be done to fully recover from the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. The official unemployment rate likely underestimates the actual reduction in unemployment due to misclassification of workers. Despite the challenges, the pace of job growth has been unprecedented, with 9.3 million jobs added in just three months. These positive trends indicate a promising path towards economic recovery.
