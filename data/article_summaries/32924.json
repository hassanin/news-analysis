President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation imposing a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum articles, with the exception of imports from Canada and Mexico. The Secretary of Commerce had previously advised the President that imports of aluminum were threatening the national security of the United States. The tariff is intended to address this threat and revive the domestic aluminum industry. The President also stated that ongoing discussions with Canada and Mexico will determine whether the tariff exemption for those countries will continue. The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to provide relief from the tariff for aluminum articles that are not produced in sufficient quantities or of satisfactory quality in the United States, as well as for specific national security considerations. The Secretary will also issue procedures for requests for exclusion from the tariff. The tariff will go into effect on March 23, 2018, and will continue until further notice.
