The Biden-Harris Administration is praising the House's passage of a bipartisan funding bill. The bill includes investments in various areas such as support for Ukraine, the creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, education funding, and efforts to tackle crime. The legislation aims to reduce costs for families and businesses, support economic recovery, promote equity, and restore US leadership internationally. It also seeks to end the use of short-term continuing resolutions that have hindered the government's ability to address pressing issues. The administration emphasizes that these investments are being made in a fiscally responsible manner, with the deficit decreasing for the first time since 2015. The Senate is urged to send the bill to the President for signature without delay.
