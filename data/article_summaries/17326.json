In this article, President Barack Obama issues a Presidential Memorandum regarding the implementation of provisions of the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011 relating to the Keystone XL Pipeline permit. The Act requires a determination of whether the Keystone XL pipeline project would serve the national interest within 60 days of enactment. The State Department had previously stated that it needed more time to gather necessary information and review environmental issues, energy security, the economy, and foreign policy consequences. Based on this recommendation, President Obama determines that the project, as presented and analyzed at this time, would not serve the national interest. He directs the Secretary of State to submit a report to Congress and issue a denial of the Keystone XL pipeline permit application. The memorandum clarifies that it does not create any rights or benefits enforceable by any party against the United States or any other entity. The Secretary of State is also authorized to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
