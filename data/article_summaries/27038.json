In this article, President Donald Trump declares a national emergency concerning the southern border of the United States in order to address the border security and humanitarian crisis. The ongoing crisis is seen as a threat to national security, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The executive branch has already taken steps to address the crisis, but further action is needed to control unlawful migration, the flow of narcotics, and criminals across the border. As a result, the national emergency declared on February 15, 2019, will continue beyond February 15, 2021, according to Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
