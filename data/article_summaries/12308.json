During a press gaggle aboard Air Force One, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney discussed the President's decision not to go to Russia and the current state of relations with Russia. Carney stated that the decision to cancel the summit in Moscow was made after considering the utility of the summit in light of various challenges and issues encountered. He emphasized that the decision was not solely based on the Edward Snowden situation. Carney also mentioned that the US continues to have important relations with Russia and will engage with them on a variety of matters. He stated that even though there have been recent challenges, the relationship should not be viewed in black-and-white terms and that the US will continue to engage with Russia because it is in the best interests of the United States. Carney did not expect any other expressions of disappointment or frustration from the administration. He mentioned that the President had not had any discussions with the Russians since the announcement was made, but the State Department and Defense Department may have had conversations with them. Carney confirmed that the Friday meeting with the Russians would focus on a broad range of issues and was not specifically about Snowden. He also mentioned that Sweden was now on the President's itinerary and that a visit to Sweden had been under consideration for some time. Carney clarified that when the President referred to Putin as the head of the KGB, he was making the point that Putin spent a long time in his formative years in the KGB. Finally, Carney stated that he had no updates on the current threat that led to embassy closures and that the US had not made any changes in the precautions taken in reaction to the threat.
