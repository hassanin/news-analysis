President Obama has declared a major disaster in North Carolina and has ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following a severe winter storm in March 2014. The declaration makes federal funding available to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in nine counties. The funding is also available for statewide hazard mitigation measures. Elizabeth Turner has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations, and additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state.
