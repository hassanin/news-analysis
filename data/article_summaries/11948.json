President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Maine and authorized federal aid to supplement recovery efforts after a severe winter storm, snowstorm, and flooding that occurred from January 26-28, 2015. The federal funding will be available to state, tribal, and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, to assist with emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The counties of Androscoggin, Cumberland, and York are specifically eligible for this assistance. Additionally, the state and local governments in these counties can receive cost-sharing assistance for snow removal during a continuous 48-hour period. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding. James N. Russo has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments.
