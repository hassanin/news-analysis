Deputy National Security Advisor Avril Haines met with the family of Aya Hijazi, a U.S.-Egyptian dual citizen who has been detained in Egypt for over two years. Haines expressed President Obama's concern for the welfare of American citizens held abroad and assured Hijazi's family that the United States will continue to offer consular support. The United States is urging the Egyptian government to drop all charges against Hijazi and release her from prison.
