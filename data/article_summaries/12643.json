In September 2014, President Barack Obama issued a proclamation to expand the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. The monument was initially established in 2009 to protect the marine environment around several islands and atolls in the Pacific Ocean. The expansion includes the waters and submerged lands around Jarvis, Wake, and Johnston Islands. The purpose of the expansion is to preserve the historic and scientific objects in these areas, which include unique biodiversity, deep-sea corals, and important habitat for species such as turtles, seabirds, and manta rays. The proclamation also emphasizes the importance of scientific exploration and research within the monument and adjacent areas. The Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce are responsible for the management of the monument and its expansion, including regulating fishing and ensuring the proper care and management of the protected areas. The proclamation also acknowledges the importance of national security and the rights of other nations in the management of the monument. The Secretaries of Defense and Commerce may permit activities necessary for emergencies, national security, and law enforcement purposes. The proclamation does not limit the activities and exercises of the Armed Forces, but they are expected to act in a manner consistent with the goals of the monument. The establishment of the monument expansion is subject to valid existing rights, and it does not create any new rights or benefits enforceable against the United States.
