Yesterday, the White House hosted a roundtable conversation in celebration of Lesbian Day of Visibility. The event featured trailblazing lesbian and LGBTQI+ senior leaders from the White House and the broader Biden-Harris Administration. Among the participants were Ambassador Chantale Wong, the first out lesbian to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate to an ambassador post, and Admiral Rachel Levine, the first openly transgender woman to achieve the rank of four-star admiral in any of the country's uniformed services. The discussion focused on the unique barriers and challenges faced by lesbians and LGBTQI+ women, including health equity, reproductive justice, mental health, isolation, discrimination, economic justice, and housing issues. Administration officials highlighted the actions taken by the Biden Administration to advance equity and visibility for lesbians and other LGBTQI+ women, reaffirming the President's commitment to full equality for all.
