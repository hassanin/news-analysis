On June 25, 2022, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, S. 2089, also known as the "Keep Kids Fed Act of 2022," extends certain flexibilities for child nutrition programs and provides temporary increases in reimbursement rates for school meals and meals provided at child care centers. The second bill, S. 2938, also known as the "Bipartisan Safer Communities Act," enhances certain restrictions and penalties on firearms purchases, promotes evidence-based best practices for school safety, authorizes grants to expand access to mental health services, and appropriates emergency funding for mental health resources and school safety measures. The President expressed gratitude to Senators Debbie Stabenow, John Boozman, Murphy, Cornyn, Sinema, Tillis, as well as Senate and House leadership, and other Congressional leaders for their leadership and support in passing these bills.
