President Joe Biden has proclaimed April 16 through April 23, 2023, as a week of observance of the Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust. In his proclamation, he mourns the six million Jews who were murdered during the Holocaust, as well as the millions of other individuals who were killed by the Nazis and their collaborators. He emphasizes the importance of remembering and honoring the victims and survivors of the Holocaust and vows to fight against antisemitism and hate. President Biden has appointed a Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism, developed a national strategy to counter antisemitism, and increased funding for the security of nonprofits, including synagogues and Jewish Community Centers. He also convened a White House summit on combating hate-fueled violence. The proclamation concludes with the message that hate will not prevail and that together, we can ensure "never again" is a promise we keep.
