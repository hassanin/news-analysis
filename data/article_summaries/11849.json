John Dingell, the longest-serving Member of Congress in U.S. history, has announced his retirement. Dingell served in the House of Representatives for nearly six decades, representing southeastern Michigan. Throughout his career, Dingell was known for his influential legislative work, including his support for the Civil Rights Act, Medicare, and the authorship of important environmental legislation such as the Clean Air Act and the Endangered Species Act. However, his most notable accomplishment was his tireless fight for quality, affordable healthcare for all Americans. Dingell's father had introduced a comprehensive health reform bill, and John continued to introduce healthcare legislation every session. As an original author of the Affordable Care Act, Dingell played a significant role in providing millions of families with the security of knowing they won't lose everything if they get sick. The people of Michigan and the entire country are grateful for Dingell's service.
