The article is a statement released on January 29, 2017, regarding immigration. The statement emphasizes that America is a proud nation of immigrants and will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression, but it will do so while protecting its own citizens and border. The policy mentioned is similar to President Obama's ban on visas for refugees from Iraq in 2011. The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror. The statement clarifies that this is not a Muslim ban, but rather a measure to address terrorism and ensure the safety of the country. It also mentions that there are over 40 different majority-Muslim countries that are not affected by this order. The statement concludes by stating that visas will be issued to all countries once secure policies have been reviewed and implemented over the next 90 days. The President expresses concern for the humanitarian crisis in Syria and states that while protecting and serving the country is a priority, efforts will be made to help those who are suffering.
