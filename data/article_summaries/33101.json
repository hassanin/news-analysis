President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation on November 30, 2017, declaring December 2017 as National Impaired Driving Prevention Month. The proclamation emphasizes the need to eliminate impaired driving and highlights the fact that every 50 minutes, a person in the United States dies in a vehicle crash involving alcohol. It acknowledges the progress made in reducing impaired driving, but also notes an increase in alcohol-impaired traffic fatalities in recent years. The proclamation calls for raising awareness about the dangers of impaired driving, supporting technological advancements to address the issue, providing resources to law enforcement, and taking individual responsibility to prevent impaired driving. The President urges all Americans to make responsible decisions and take appropriate measures to prevent impaired driving.
