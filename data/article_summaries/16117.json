The article discusses the continuation of the national emergency with respect to persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism. This national emergency was declared on September 23, 2001, in response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The President took this action to address the threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States posed by these acts of terrorism. The national emergency and the measures taken to deal with it will continue beyond September 23, 2011, as these individuals continue to pose a threat. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
