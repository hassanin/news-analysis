President Biden signed an Executive Order on his first day in office, directing the federal government to advance equity and racial justice. He has now announced the American Families Plan, which aims to deliver a more equitable America through investments in education, workers, and the tax code. The plan is projected to lift over 10 million people out of poverty in 2022, with significant reductions in poverty rates for Black, Latino, and Asian American communities. The plan includes provisions for universal pre-school for 3- and 4-year-olds, free community college, investments in education and preparation for teachers, affordable child care, paid leave, nutrition programs, and tax cuts for families and workers. These investments aim to provide opportunities for children and create a fairer society.
