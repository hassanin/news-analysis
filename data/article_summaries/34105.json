In a press briefing, National Security Advisor General H.R. McMaster and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin discussed the Trump administration's response to the recent actions of the Maduro regime in Venezuela. They announced that the United States has sanctioned Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, freezing all of his assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction and prohibiting U.S. citizens from dealing with him. McMaster stated that Maduro is now a dictator and that the United States stands with the people of Venezuela in opposing his regime. Mnuchin added that the sanctions highlight the potential cost and personal consequences that enablers of the regime may face. The briefing also addressed the resignation of White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci. He will not have another role in the administration, and General John Kelly, the new White House Chief of Staff, has full authority to operate within the White House. The briefing concluded with updates on the First Lady's upcoming trip to the Invictus Games, Vice President Mike Pence's visit to Eastern Europe, and a partnership between American energy and the government of Ukraine.
