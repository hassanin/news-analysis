The Presidential Delegation to the funeral of President Moise is safe and accounted for. The delegation, led by Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield and joined by Representative Meeks and Representative Fortenberry, has returned safely to the United States from Haiti. The United States remains deeply concerned about the situation in Haiti and urges all parties to express themselves peacefully. The leaders of Haiti are called upon to ensure that their supporters refrain from violence. It is crucial for Haiti's leaders to work together and engage in a broad and inclusive dialogue that reflects the will of the Haitian people. The United States will continue to provide requested assistance, including equipment and training, to the Haitian National Police and the Government of Haiti, despite ongoing security challenges. The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security are also providing investigative assistance to the Haitian authorities at their request, in order to hold accountable those responsible for the assassination of President Moise. The United States stands with the people of Haiti during this difficult time.
