President Barack Obama has proclaimed May 17 through May 23, 2014, as National Safe Boating Week. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of taking precautions and practicing responsible behavior when boating. It encourages boaters to take a boating safety course, conduct a vessel safety check, and file a float plan with family or friends. Boaters are also advised to understand the marine forecast and to always wear life jackets and avoid consuming alcohol or drugs. The proclamation recognizes the work of the United States Coast Guard in preventing boating accidents and thanks their partners across the nation. The Congress has authorized and requested the President to proclaim the 7-day period prior to Memorial Day weekend as "National Safe Boating Week" annually.
