President Barack Obama has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13611 with respect to Yemen will continue beyond May 16, 2015. The actions and policies of certain members of the Yemeni government and others continue to threaten the country's peace, security, and stability. These actions include obstructing the implementation of a 2011 agreement for a peaceful transition of power and obstructing the political process in Yemen. As a result, President Obama has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
