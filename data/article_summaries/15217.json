President Obama called President Putin to address the escalating violence in eastern Ukraine and Russia's support for the separatists. Obama reiterated America's support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. He emphasized the human toll of the fighting and the importance of reaching a peaceful resolution through ongoing discussions between Russia, France, Germany, and Ukraine. Obama also stressed the need for a negotiated settlement based on the commitments in the Minsk agreement. However, if Russia continues its aggressive actions, the costs for Russia will rise.
