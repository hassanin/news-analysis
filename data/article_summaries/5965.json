The article highlights the condemnation of Houthi attacks against commercial vessels in the Red Sea by 44 countries on December 19, 2023. The UN Security Council also expressed its concern on December 1, 2023. The ongoing attacks, which have escalated significantly in the past week, involve missiles, small boats, and attempted hijackings. The article reiterates that these attacks are illegal, unacceptable, and destabilizing, with no lawful justification. They pose a direct threat to the freedom of navigation and global trade in a critical waterway. The attacks impact innocent lives worldwide and require collective action. The Red Sea accounts for a significant portion of global seaborne trade, including grain, oil, and liquefied natural gas. Shipping companies are rerouting vessels, leading to increased costs and delays in the delivery of goods, potentially affecting critical food, fuel, and humanitarian assistance. The article calls for an immediate end to these attacks and the release of unlawfully detained vessels and crews. The Houthis will be held responsible for the consequences if they continue to threaten lives, the global economy, and the free flow of commerce. The international rules-based order will be upheld, and those responsible for unlawful seizures and attacks will be held accountable.
