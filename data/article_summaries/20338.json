The United States and Panama have a long history of cooperation in various areas such as economics, security, and politics. Panama is currently the fastest growing economy in the region and the United States is its largest trading partner, accounting for about 23% of all two-way trade. The trade between the two countries has been increasing since the U.S.-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement came into effect in 2012. The strategic location of Panama and the expansion of the Panama Canal will further enhance the importance of trade between the two countries. The Panama Canal is a crucial part of global commerce, with roughly 5% of world trade passing through it every year. The opening of the expanded Canal in 2015 is expected to double cargo volume by 2025, benefiting U.S. exporters by reducing shipping costs. In order to facilitate increased business and travel between the United States and Panama, joint efforts have been announced to expedite travel and clearance for pre-approved travelers. The security cooperation between the two countries is also strong, with Panama seizing a significant amount of cocaine with the support of the United States. Panama has shown its commitment to the security of the Canal by intercepting a vessel transporting arms in violation of UN Security Council sanctions. Panama has also demonstrated leadership by signing onto the G-20 joint statement on Syria.
