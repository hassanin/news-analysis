In a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest highlighted the progress made by the U.S. economy since the financial crisis in 2008. He mentioned that Wall Street has made important progress, economic output has increased, and the housing market has improved. Earnest also emphasized the importance of passing a budget that reverses harmful cuts and avoids a government shutdown. He mentioned that President Obama will be speaking at the quarterly meeting of the Business Roundtable to make the case for increasing investments in infrastructure, supporting American jobs, strengthening education and innovation, and fighting efforts to undermine Wall Street reform. Earnest also addressed questions on the migrant crisis in Europe, Russia's involvement in Syria, the Iran nuclear deal, cyber security, and the upcoming presidential debates.
