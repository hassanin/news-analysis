President Obama will be traveling to Elkhart, Indiana on June 1 to highlight the economic progress that the city and America have made, as well as the economic challenges that still remain. He will be visiting Concord Community High School, the site of his first trip as President.

The arrival and departure of Air Force One will be open to pre-credentialed media but closed to the public. The President's remarks at Concord Community High School will also be open to pre-credentialed media and will be streamed live on the White House website. There will be limited distribution of tickets for members of the public, available on May 31 at Concord Community High School on a first-come, first-served basis.
