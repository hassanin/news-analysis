The GDP numbers for the first year of the American economy in the 21st century indicate the fastest economic growth in nearly four decades, as well as the greatest year of job growth in American history. This growth has surpassed that of China's for the first time in 20 years. The article attributes this success to a deliberate economic strategy focused on creating good jobs, rebuilding manufacturing, and strengthening domestic supply chains to enhance the competitiveness of American companies. The author highlights the positive impact of these efforts, such as better jobs with improved pay and benefits, low layoff rates, and increased investment in manufacturing within the United States. Additionally, there has been a significant rise in new small business applications, indicating a renewed sense of optimism and belief in the American dream. The author urges Congress to sustain this momentum by passing legislation to further enhance American competitiveness, support supply chains, strengthen manufacturing and innovation, invest in families and clean energy, and reduce household expenses.
