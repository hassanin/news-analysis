President Barack Obama has published a notice stating that the national emergency with respect to Lebanon, which was declared in Executive Order 13441 in 2007, will continue beyond August 1, 2015. This decision was made due to ongoing activities, such as arms transfers to Hizballah, that undermine Lebanese sovereignty, contribute to instability in the region, and pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
