On July 26, 2021, the President signed a new law called H.R. 26, also known as the "Construction Consensus Procurement Improvement Act of 2021." This law amends the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and corrects a provision related to the use of reverse auctions for awarding Federal contracts. The law is a result of the efforts of Representatives James Comer and Ro Khanna, as well as Senators Rob Portman and Mazie Hirono, who showed leadership in pushing for this amendment.
