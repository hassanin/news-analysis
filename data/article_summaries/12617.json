President Barack Obama has transmitted a proposed Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Russian Federation for Cooperation in the Field of Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy to the Congress. This agreement aims to promote cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The proposed agreement has been negotiated in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and other applicable laws. It allows for the transfer of technology, material, equipment, and components for nuclear research and power production, subject to subsequent U.S. licensing decisions. The agreement does not permit transfers of Restricted Data, and transfers of sensitive nuclear technology and facilities require an amendment to the agreement. The President believes that the situation in Georgia is no longer an obstacle to proceeding with the agreement and that the level and scope of U.S.-Russia cooperation on Iran justifies resubmitting the proposed agreement to the Congress for review. The President urges the Congress to give the proposed agreement favorable consideration.
