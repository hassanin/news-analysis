The Biden-Harris Administration has announced a temporary pause on decisions regarding the export of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) to non-FTA countries. The Department of Energy will update the underlying analyses for authorizations, as the current ones are outdated and do not adequately consider factors such as potential energy cost increases and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions. The pause aims to integrate these critical considerations and protect the health of communities, particularly those disproportionately affected by pollution. However, the pause will not affect the U.S.'s ability to supply LNG to allies in the near-term. The U.S. is already the top exporter of LNG globally, and exports are expected to double by the end of the decade. The administration reaffirms its commitment to supporting allies while taking ambitious climate action. Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress who deny climate change are being criticized for attempting to undermine the economic, environmental, and health benefits of the administration's climate investments.
