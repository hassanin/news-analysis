President Donald Trump has signed a proclamation imposing a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on steel articles imported into the United States, with the exception of Canada and Mexico. The decision was made after a report by the Secretary of Commerce concluded that steel imports threaten to impair the national security of the United States. The tariff is intended to revive the domestic steel industry, prevent further closures of steel production facilities, and reduce reliance on foreign producers for steel. The President also authorized the Secretary of Commerce to exclude certain steel articles from the import restrictions if there is a lack of sufficient domestic production capacity or for specific national security-based considerations. The President will continue ongoing discussions with Canada and Mexico regarding steel imports.
