President Barack Obama has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran will continue beyond its anniversary date. This national emergency was initially declared in 1995 and is being extended due to the unresolved crisis between the United States and Iran. The actions and policies of the Iranian government are seen as contrary to the interests of the United States and continue to pose a threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy. As a result, comprehensive sanctions against Iran will remain in place.
