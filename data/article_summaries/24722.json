The President of the United States, in a statement, congratulates Reuven Rivlin on his election as the next President of Israel. The US and Israel have a strong relationship based on shared democratic values, commitment to Israel's security, and partnership in research and technology. Rivlin has a long history of public service, and the US looks forward to continued strong ties under his presidency. The statement also praises outgoing President Shimon Peres for his legacy of courage, conviction, and compassion, particularly his dedication to peace. Peres will be honored with the Congressional Gold Medal during his visit to Washington later in the month.
