On February 20, 2013, President Barack Obama deployed approximately 40 additional U.S. military personnel to Niger with the consent of the Government of Niger. This deployment is to provide support for intelligence collection and facilitate intelligence sharing with French forces in Mali and other partners in the region. The total number of U.S. military personnel deployed to Niger is around 100. The recently deployed forces are armed for their own protection and security. President Obama directed this deployment in line with U.S. national security interests and his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. He is providing this report to Congress as part of his efforts to keep them fully informed, in compliance with the War Powers Resolution. President Obama expresses his appreciation for the Congress's support in this action.
