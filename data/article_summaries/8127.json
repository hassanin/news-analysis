President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13848, which addresses the threat of foreign interference in United States elections, is to continue beyond September 12, 2022. While there is no evidence of a foreign power altering election outcomes, the proliferation of digital devices and internet-based communications has increased the vulnerability to foreign interference. The ability of foreign entities to undermine public confidence in US elections through unauthorized access to election infrastructure and the dissemination of propaganda and disinformation remains a significant threat to national security and foreign policy. Therefore, President Biden has determined it necessary to extend the national emergency.
