The American AI Initiative, launched by President Donald J. Trump, aims to prioritize and accelerate the development of artificial intelligence (AI) in the United States. The initiative focuses on five key areas: investing in AI research and development (R&D), making AI resources more available, setting AI governance standards, building the AI workforce, and protecting the country's AI advantage internationally. By directing federal agencies to prioritize AI investments, making federal data and resources more accessible to AI experts, establishing guidance for AI development and use, prioritizing AI-relevant skills training programs, and promoting an international environment that supports AI R&D, the initiative aims to maintain American leadership in AI and ensure that AI technologies benefit the American people.
