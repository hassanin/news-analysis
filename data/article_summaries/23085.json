The United States welcomes the convening of Somalia's New Federal Parliament, seeing it as an important milestone in completing the Roadmap to End the Somali Transition. They commend the people of Somalia for their hard work and commitment to a better future, urging those communities that have not yet nominated their members of parliament to do so urgently. The US also calls for increased participation of women in the Parliament and other national institutions. The Parliament must now adopt rules of procedure and hold elections for Speaker and President in a timely manner. The US reminds Somali leaders of their responsibility to fulfill their obligations and warns that any attempt to impede the political transition will not be tolerated. The convening of the new Parliament is seen as a step towards ending instability and restoring governance. The US will continue to work with the international community, regional stakeholders, and the people of Somalia to promote transparency, good governance, and development for a better future.
