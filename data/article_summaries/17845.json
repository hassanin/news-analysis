The article is a statement from the White House Press Secretary regarding the Senate's action on the Buffett Rule. The President proposed this rule to ensure that millionaires do not pay a lower share of their income in taxes than middle-class families. The President believes that the wealthiest individuals should pay their fair share while protecting 98% of Americans from tax increases. The statement criticizes the Ryan Republican approach, which provides significant tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans at the expense of investing in the economy, job creation, and the middle class. Congress will have the opportunity to vote on the Buffett Rule in the coming weeks, and the American people will see whether they are willing to support fairness for the middle class. The statement urges Members of Congress to vote in favor of this common-sense approach.
