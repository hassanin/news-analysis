The Council of Economic Advisers criticizes the Joint Committee on Taxation's (JCT) dynamic economic growth estimate of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The CEA believes that the JCT's estimate underestimates the growth effects of the proposed tax changes and fails to consider the impact of overseas investment. The CEA also criticizes the lack of documentation and transparency in the JCT's analysis. The CEA conducted its own research, which concluded that GDP would be 3 to 5 percent higher over time because of the tax bill. They argue that their assessment is more accurate and is supported by international experience and the replication of results. The CEA also mentions a recent letter from nine prominent economists that supports their estimates of growth.
