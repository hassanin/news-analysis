The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has released information on how States can cover the cost of treating babies suffering from neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS occurs when babies are exposed to opioids or other addictive drugs during pregnancy and experience painful withdrawal symptoms during their first few weeks of life. The HHS is dedicated to bringing attention to successful programs like Lily's Place in West Virginia, which provides addiction recovery treatment to the entire family. The HHS encourages States, hospital groups, and nonprofits to explore the benefits and waivers available to help these babies and their parents.
