The Obama Administration has announced new actions to promote clean energy savings for all Americans. The amount of electricity generated from solar energy has increased significantly, and the price of residential solar energy systems has been cut by more than 50 percent. The U.S. Department of Energy's SunShot program has set a new target to cut the cost of solar in half by 2030. The administration has launched a challenge called Solar In Your Community to expand solar access to low and moderate-income households, state and local governments, and non-profit organizations. They aim to bring 1 gigawatt of solar to low and moderate-income families by 2020. The National Community Solar Partnership aims to increase access to solar for renters and those without adequate roof space. Best practice guidelines for residential PACE financing programs have been issued to protect consumers. The Department of Housing and Urban Development has partnered with EDF Climate Corps fellows to improve energy efficiency in HUD-Assisted and Public Housing. The Department of Energy is working with Historically Black Colleges and Universities to establish the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Clean Energy Coalition, which will focus on energy education, solar deployment, job creation, and reducing environmental impacts in low and moderate-income communities.
