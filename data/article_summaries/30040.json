The presidential memorandum titled "Developing a Sustainable Spectrum Strategy for America's Future" emphasizes the importance of efficiently and effectively using radiofrequency spectrum (spectrum) to achieve economic, national security, science, safety, and other federal mission goals. The memorandum acknowledges the significant impact of mobile wireless broadband connectivity on various aspects of American life and the increasing demand for spectrum access due to technological advancements such as autonomous vehicles, precision agriculture, and the Internet of Things. It highlights the need for the United States to lead in fifth-generation (5G) wireless technologies and emphasizes the importance of spectrum access for both federal and non-federal entities. The memorandum directs executive departments and agencies to report their future spectrum requirements and review their current frequency assignments and spectrum usage. It also calls for reports on emerging technologies and research and development priorities related to spectrum access and efficiency. The memorandum further mandates the submission of reports on existing and planned spectrum repurposing initiatives and the development of a long-term National Spectrum Strategy that includes policy recommendations to increase spectrum access, promote efficient spectrum use, develop advanced technologies and spectrum-sharing tools, and improve the competitiveness of US industries. A Spectrum Strategy Task Force is established to coordinate the implementation of the memorandum, and various provisions ensure compliance with applicable laws, protection of sensitive information, and the availability of appropriations. The memorandum revokes previous presidential memoranda on wireless broadband revolution and wireless innovation.
