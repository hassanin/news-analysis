President Obama announced on February 23, 2009, that states will be able to access the first two quarters of Federal Medical Assistance Percentage funding (FMAP) starting on February 25. This funding, totaling over $15 billion, is part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and will help cover the costs of Medicaid programs in the states. The funding aims to provide relief to Americans affected by the economic crisis and ensure that essential services are not cut. Medicaid provides health care coverage to over 49 million Americans, and this funding could potentially help an additional 20 million Americans get covered. The Department of Health and Human Services' Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will administer the funding, and states will need to meet Medicaid eligibility requirements to receive the funds. The announcement was made during a meeting of the nation's governors at the White House.
