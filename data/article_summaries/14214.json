National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice is currently in Afghanistan on a planned trip to visit troops and civilians during the holiday season. This trip is an opportunity for her to assess the situation on the ground and meet with American troops and civilians. Afghanistan remains a top national security priority for the United States, and Ambassador Rice will be thanking those who are serving away from their families on Thanksgiving. She will also be hearing directly from U.S. troops, diplomats, and development professionals about ongoing efforts as the combat mission comes to a responsible conclusion in 2014. Additionally, Ambassador Rice will meet with Afghan civil society leaders, Afghan officials, and visit U.S.-supported assistance projects.
