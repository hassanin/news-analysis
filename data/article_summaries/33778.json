The article discusses the changing public opinion regarding the tax law signed by President Trump in December. Initially, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi referred to the benefits from tax cuts as "crumbs" and claimed that the investments by American companies would be insignificant. However, recent polls show that a majority of Americans now approve of the tax law. Over 400 companies have announced worker bonuses, raises, or 401(k) boosts as a result of tax cuts. Examples include Walmart raising its minimum wage and issuing bonuses, Fiat Chrysler issuing bonuses, and Southwest Airlines donating to charity. The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that the impact of tax reform could be more than $4,000 annually for the average American family. Other surveys indicate that tax cuts are driving optimism throughout the economy. Some Democrats have acknowledged the importance of tax relief, while others continue to criticize the tax cuts.
