President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation designating September 15 through October 15, 2019, as National Hispanic Heritage Month. The proclamation celebrates the accomplishments of Hispanic Americans and highlights their contributions to American society, culture, and the economy. President Trump emphasizes that his administration has worked to create opportunities for all Americans, including Hispanic Americans, by reducing unemployment and poverty rates, signing pro-growth legislation like the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and promoting economic and political relationships with Latin American partners. The proclamation also mentions the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the administration's support for liberty and democracy in the Western Hemisphere. President Trump calls upon public officials, educators, librarians, and all Americans to observe National Hispanic Heritage Month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
