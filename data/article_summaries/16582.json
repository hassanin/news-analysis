The Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, had a meeting with President Park of South Korea to discuss various alliance and regional issues, including North Korea and China's air defense identification zone. They both agreed that China's announcement of the zone was destabilizing and increased tensions, and they reaffirmed that they do not recognize the zone and it will not affect their operations. They also discussed the implications for South Korea's air defense identification zone and the importance of freedom of overflight and lowering tensions. The Vice President also expressed the United States' commitment to South Korea's security. They also discussed trade and economic issues, including South Korea's interest in joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The Vice President emphasized the importance of improved relations between South Korea and Japan and trilateral security cooperation among the United States, Japan, and South Korea. The Vice President also had private conversations with both Prime Minister Abe of Japan and President Park of South Korea on this issue. The Vice President expressed understanding for South Korea's approach to potential adjustments to its air defense identification zone. The United States and South Korea are closely coordinating on the issue and are on the same page in terms of taking actions that are consistent with international practice and do not escalate tensions. The issue of U.S. bases in South Korea was not discussed as it is not a point of friction and is seen as a core element of the U.S.-South Korea partnership. The Vice President and President Park also discussed North Korea and Iran separately. They both have the same view that the only way to get back to dialogue with North Korea is if they take concrete steps to show they are serious about it. The Vice President also discussed the Iran nuclear deal and the importance of continued pressure on Iran.
