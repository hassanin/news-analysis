Vice President Pence is representing the United States at the 8th Summit of the Americas, at the request of President Trump. He aims to promote policies that will strengthen the U.S. economy and hold undemocratic actors in Latin America accountable for their actions. Last year, Pence traveled to Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Panama to increase pressure against the Maduro regime in Venezuela and negotiate better trade deals for American workers. He also met with Venezuelan dissidents and hosted the Northern Triangle Conference on Prosperity and Security in Central America. Next month, he will travel to Brazil to further advance U.S. policies and commitment to the region.
