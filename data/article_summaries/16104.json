President Barack Obama has vetoed H.R. 1735, the "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016." Although there are some provisions in the bill that he supports, such as the codification of interrogation-related reforms and positive changes to the military retirement system, there are several reasons why he has chosen to veto it. 

Firstly, the bill would constrain the Department of Defense's ability to conduct multi-year defense planning and align military capabilities with the national defense strategy. It would also impede the closure of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and prevent essential defense reforms from being implemented. 

Furthermore, the bill fails to authorize funding for national defense in a fiscally responsible manner. It underfunds the military in the base budget and relies on an irresponsible budget gimmick of using $38 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations funding, which was meant to fund wars and is not subject to budget caps. This threatens the readiness and capabilities of the military and does not provide the support that the men and women in uniform deserve. 

President Obama has repeatedly called for the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, as he believes it weakens national security, strains resources, and damages relationships with allies. However, this bill not only fails to remove restrictions on detainee transfers but also seeks to impose more onerous ones. The President argues that the executive branch should have the flexibility to determine when and where to prosecute and transfer detainees based on national security interests and humane treatment policies. 

Lastly, the bill does not adopt many essential defense reforms, including force structure, weapons systems, and military healthcare. The President believes that the defense strategy should invest every dollar where it will have the greatest effect and proposes critical reforms to divest unnecessary force structure, slow compensation growth, and reduce wasteful overhead. However, the bill would require the Department of Defense to retain unnecessary force structure and weapons systems that are unaffordable in the current fiscal environment. 

Due to the bill's potential negative impact on national security, President Obama has vetoed it.
