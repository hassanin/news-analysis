President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Mississippi due to severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred from April 23-24, 2010. This declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to affected individuals in certain counties for temporary housing, home repairs, and low-cost loans for uninsured property losses. Federal funding is also available for debris removal, emergency protective measures, and hazard mitigation measures. Michael Bolch has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Damage assessments are still ongoing, and more counties may be designated for assistance. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by calling FEMA.
