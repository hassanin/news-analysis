Second Lady Karen Pence has revealed the 2019 Christmas decorations at the Vice President's Residence, with the theme being "Victorian Christmas." The decorations highlight the historic Victorian-era residence, which was built in 1893. Devers Design assisted in the design and installation of the decorations, with the help of over 40 volunteers. The decorations include 300 feet of indoor garland, Victorian ornaments made from paper cones filled with dried baby's breath and gold ribbons, fresh cranberries, wreath chandeliers, and hundreds of ornaments and white and gold beads. Outside the Residence, there are 2,100 feet of garland and 160 velvet bows lining the fence, as well as a 16.5 foot Frasier Fir adorned with lights and ornaments designed by children from Riley Hospital for Children. Inside the historic home, there are 7 Christmas trees provided by Wyckoff's Christmas Tree Farm. The Pence family will welcome over 3,000 guests into the Vice President's Residence during the holiday season.
