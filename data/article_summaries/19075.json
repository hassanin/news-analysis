President Obama has declared an emergency in the state of Colorado due to severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides. This declaration allows federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts. The Department of Homeland Security, specifically the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), will coordinate all disaster relief efforts to alleviate hardship and suffering caused by the emergency. FEMA is authorized to provide equipment and resources to mitigate the impacts of the emergency. Emergency protective measures will be funded at 75 percent federal funding. William J. Doran III has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
