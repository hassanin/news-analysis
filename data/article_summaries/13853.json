President Barack Obama has announced a Presidential Delegation to commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall. On November 9, 1989, Germans from both sides of the wall were able to freely move between East and West Germany for the first time in over a generation. This year, the President recognizes their decision, as well as the decisions of the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe in 1989, to choose freedom over oppression. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will lead the delegation, which includes U.S. Ambassador to Germany Philip D. Murphy, Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft (Ret.), Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski, and Craig Kennedy.
