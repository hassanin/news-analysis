President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Florida due to severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred from April 28 to May 6, 2014. This declaration allows federal funding to be provided to affected individuals in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Hazard mitigation measures will also be funded on a cost-sharing basis statewide. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has named Gracia B. Szczech as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Damage assessments are ongoing in other areas, and more counties and forms of assistance may be designated once assessments are complete. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance online or by calling FEMA's toll-free numbers.
