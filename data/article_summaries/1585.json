The President and a bipartisan group have reached an agreement on a $550 billion infrastructure investment plan. The deal aims to improve the economy, create jobs, and make the country's infrastructure more sustainable and resilient. It includes investments in roads, bridges, public transit, passenger and freight rail, electric vehicle infrastructure, airports, ports, waterways, resilience and climate change mitigation, clean drinking water, high-speed internet, environmental remediation, and power infrastructure. The plan will also prioritize the needs of disadvantaged communities and promote equity. The funding will come from a combination of sources, including redirecting unspent emergency relief funds, corporate user fees, tax enforcement, and increased economic growth.
