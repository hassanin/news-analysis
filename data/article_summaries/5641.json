The U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) will hold its second ministerial meeting on May 15th and 16th in Saclay, near Paris. The TTC was established last year to update the rules of the road for a 21st-century economy and technology ecosystem. The co-chairs of the TTC include Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, and EU co-chairs Margrethe Vestager and Valdis Dombrovskis. The goal of the TTC is to promote transatlantic cooperation on trade, technology, and innovation. Some of the outcomes expected from the upcoming meeting include deeper information sharing on technology exports, joint approaches to international standard-setting bodies, and a transatlantic approach to semiconductor investments. The TTC will also address issues related to non-market trade practices, supply chain disruptions, and misinformation. The focus of the meeting will be on both Russia and China, with discussions on countering non-market economy policies and practices. The TTC aims to strengthen the U.S.-EU economic partnership and advance a common agenda based on democratic values.
