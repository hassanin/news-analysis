Secretary Colin Powell dedicated his life to defending our nation, serving as National Security Advisor, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Secretary of State. He was known for being an independent thinker and a barrier breaker, inspiring leaders in the military and throughout the country. Powell served with courage and unwavering belief in the principles and promise of the nation. As the son of immigrants, he rose through the ranks of the United States Army, becoming a decorated veteran and a devoted patriot. Powell represented the nation with dignity, grace, and strength, upholding the highest standards. His legacy can be seen in America's national security and the leaders he mentored. Condolences are sent to his wife, Alma Powell, and their children and grandchildren.
