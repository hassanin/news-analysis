The Obama Administration has announced new actions to promote innovation and efficiency in cars and trucks. Heavy duty vehicles account for over 20% of carbon pollution from transportation, so the administration is finalizing rules to improve fuel economy and reduce carbon emissions for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles for the next decade. They are also investing $140 million in new technologies for fuel efficient trucks and other vehicles. These actions will reduce approximately 1.1 billion tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to taking all cars in the US off the road for a year. The US Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation will adopt new standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles that will cut carbon pollution and improve fuel efficiency. These standards will save vehicle owners nearly $170 billion in fuel costs and reduce oil consumption by up to 82 billion gallons. The program includes carbon and fuel efficiency standards for trailers used with heavy-duty combination tractors for the first time and allows manufacturers to achieve the standards through a mix of different technologies. The Department of Energy will also invest $140 million to improve vehicle and truck efficiency. They will invest $80 million to develop fuel efficient truck technologies and $57 million in new projects for light duty vehicles. These investments will help reduce carbon emissions and petroleum consumption. The Obama Administration's efforts have already improved fuel economy and reduced emissions, and they aim to continue moving towards a cleaner transportation system.
