The President of the United States, Joseph R. Biden Jr., has issued a notice stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Zimbabwe. The national emergency was declared on March 6, 2003, by Executive Order 13288, under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The purpose of the emergency declaration is to address the threat posed by certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other individuals who seek to undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes and institutions. These actions have resulted in the breakdown of the rule of law, politically motivated violence, intimidation, and instability in the southern African region. The President has determined that the threat continues to exist and, therefore, the national emergency and associated measures will remain in effect beyond March 6, 2021, for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
