The United States has announced its decision to suspend its obligations under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and begin the process of withdrawing from the treaty. The US accuses Russia of violating the treaty by developing and deploying a prohibited missile system that poses a threat to allies and troops abroad. The US will complete its withdrawal in six months unless Russia destroys all violating missiles, launchers, and associated equipment. NATO allies are said to fully support the US in this decision. The US is committed to effective arms control that enhances security, is verifiable and enforceable, and involves partners fulfilling their obligations. The US is also open to engaging with Russia on arms control negotiations and building a positive relationship on economic, trade, political, and military levels.
