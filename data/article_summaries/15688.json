President Obama has launched the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership Steering Committee "2.0" to maintain U.S. leadership in emerging technologies and create manufacturing jobs. The committee will comprise leaders from industry, academia, and labor and will build on the progress made by the inaugural committee. The initial committee called for a national effort to strengthen the U.S. advanced manufacturing sector and made recommendations such as sustaining investments in science and technology, establishing a National Network of Manufacturing Innovation Institutes, upgrading workforce training programs, and improving the business climate for manufacturing investment. The new committee will continue to make America a magnet for jobs and manufacturing. Several of the initial committee's recommendations are already underway, including the formation of new manufacturing-innovation institutes and investment in community colleges. The committee will function as a working group of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology and will engage with the broader manufacturing community to identify innovative strategies for building U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. The committee will be chaired by Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical and Rafael Reif of MIT, and includes leaders from various industries and universities.
