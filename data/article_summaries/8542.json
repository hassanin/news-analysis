President Biden has announced five new federal judicial nominees, all of whom are highly qualified and dedicated to upholding the rule of law and the Constitution. These nominations reflect the President's commitment to ensuring diversity in the nation's courts, both in terms of personal and professional backgrounds. If confirmed, the slate of nominees would include Cindy K. Chung, who has served as the United States Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania since 2021. Kelley B. Hodge, a partner at Fox Rothschild in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, would also be nominated, along with John Frank Murphy, a partner at Baker & Hostetler in Philadelphia. Judge Mia Roberts Perez, who has served on the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas since 2016, and Judge Kai Scott, who has served on the same court since 2015, complete the slate of nominees. President Biden has made it a priority to fill judicial vacancies promptly, and these nominations mark his twenty-first round of nominees for federal judicial positions and his eighth slate of nominations in 2022, bringing the total number of announced federal judicial nominees to 112.
