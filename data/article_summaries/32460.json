The United States Trade Representative (USTR) has determined that China has engaged in unfair practices to obtain America's intellectual property, which has caused concern globally. As a result, the USTR has proposed $50 billion in tariffs on imports from China. In response to China's retaliation, President Trump is considering an additional $100 billion in tariffs and instructing the Secretary of Agriculture to protect American farmers. Despite these actions, the US is still open to discussions for fair trade and protecting American technology and intellectual property. The goal is to remove trade barriers and promote economic growth while ensuring a level playing field for American companies and workers.
