The White House has released a presidential memorandum regarding the determination of major illicit drug transit and drug-producing countries for fiscal year 2013. The memorandum identifies countries such as Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela as major drug transit and/or major illicit drug producing countries. However, being on this list does not necessarily reflect negatively on a country's counternarcotics efforts or cooperation with the United States. The memorandum also designates Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela as countries that have failed to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements. Despite this, the United States deems support for programs aiding these countries as vital to its national interests. The memorandum highlights the drug-related challenges faced by Afghanistan, particularly its high illicit opium production, and emphasizes the importance of international support for the country's drug control strategies. The memorandum also discusses the significance of countering the drug trade in the Caribbean, and the efforts made by the United States and other organizations to assist countries in the region. Additionally, it mentions the smuggling of illegal drugs from South America to the United States through Central America, Mexico, and the Eastern Pacific, and the initiatives taken by the United States to address this issue. The memorandum concludes by authorizing the submission of this determination to Congress and its publication in the Federal Register.
