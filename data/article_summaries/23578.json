President Barack Obama has issued a notice stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13611 with respect to Yemen will continue beyond May 16, 2015. The President cites the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Yemen and others as continuing to threaten Yemen's peace, security, and stability. These actions include obstructing the implementation of an agreement for a peaceful transition of power and obstructing the political process in Yemen. Therefore, President Obama has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
