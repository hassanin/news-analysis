President Biden has announced a proposal to fix the "family glitch" in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that would save hundreds of thousands of families hundreds of dollars a month. The current regulations define employer-based health insurance as "affordable" if it only covers the employee, making family members ineligible for a premium tax credit to purchase coverage on the ACA's health insurance marketplaces. The proposed rule would allow family members of workers who are offered affordable self-only coverage but unaffordable family coverage to qualify for premium tax credits. It is estimated that 200,000 uninsured people would gain coverage and nearly 1 million Americans would see their coverage become more affordable. Additionally, President Biden has signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies to continue expanding affordable, quality health coverage through Medicaid and the ACA. These actions are part of the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to protect and build on the ACA, making health care more accessible and affordable for all Americans.
