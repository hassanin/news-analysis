President Obama has declared a state of emergency in Georgia and ordered federal aid to help with the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew. The Department of Homeland Security, through FEMA, will coordinate relief efforts and provide assistance to save lives and protect property. The assistance will be provided in the counties affected by the hurricane, and FEMA is authorized to mobilize equipment and resources as needed. The federal funding for emergency protective measures will be at 75 percent. Warren J. Riley has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area.
