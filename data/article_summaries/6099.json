President Biden has been using the bully pulpit to drive change in the private sector and bring down costs for Americans. Several companies have voluntarily taken steps to lower medical bills and make it easier for families to fly together after Biden called for crackdowns on insulin prices and "junk fees" in his State of the Union address. American Airlines revised its family seating policies, and Eli Lilly announced a significant reduction in the cost of insulin. These actions align with the administration's goals of lowering prescription drug costs, expanding affordable child care options, and eliminating "junk fees." The president's top economic priority is to lower costs for American families, and he will continue to implement his competition agenda and use the bully pulpit to benefit consumers, workers, and families.
