This executive order, issued on September 19, 2019, focuses on modernizing the domestic influenza vaccine enterprise in the United States. It acknowledges the constant changes in influenza viruses and the potential for pandemics to cause significant harm. The order directs actions to reduce reliance on egg-based vaccine production, expand capacity for alternative manufacturing methods, develop more effective and longer-lasting vaccines, and promote increased influenza vaccination. It establishes a National Influenza Vaccine Task Force to monitor and report on the implementation of these actions. The order also outlines specific responsibilities for various executive departments and agencies, such as estimating costs, conducting research, and assessing current frameworks. The Task Force is to submit a report within 120 days, and subsequent updates on the implementation of the plan and new recommendations. The order terminates the Task Force upon direction from the President or the Task Force Co-Chairs.
