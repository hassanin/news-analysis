The White House has announced that 53 jurisdictions, covering over 41 million people, have committed to the Police Data Initiative (PDI), with over 90 data sets released to date. The PDI is a community of practice that aims to improve the relationship between citizens and police through the use of data that increases transparency, builds community trust, and strengthens accountability. The Administration has also announced new federal commitments to further the PDI, including initiatives from the Department of Justice Office of Community Oriented Policing Services and the Department of Justice Office on Violence Against Women. Additionally, several private sector and nonprofit organizations have committed to providing policy, technical assistance, and digital tools to support the PDI's goals.
