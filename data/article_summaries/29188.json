The President has declared a major disaster in Wyoming and has ordered Federal assistance to help with recovery efforts from a severe winter storm and straight-line winds that occurred in February 2017. The Federal funding will be available to State, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also be eligible for funding. Nancy M. Casper has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Further designations may be made in the future based on damage assessments. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA news desk.
