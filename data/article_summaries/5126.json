The Women, Peace, and Security Act of 2017 (WPS Act) is a U.S. government commitment to promoting gender equity and equality in security, peace-making, and peacekeeping. It is based on the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 and aims to engage women as leaders and participants in addressing global peace and security challenges. The WPS agenda is a priority for the Biden-Harris Administration, and it is integrated into various strategies and policies.
