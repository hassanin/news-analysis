The President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, has issued a notice to continue the national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria. This national emergency was declared in 2004 and has been modified and extended several times since then. The actions of the Syrian government, including supporting terrorism, maintaining occupation of Lebanon, pursuing weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, and obstructing stabilization and reconstruction efforts in Iraq, pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The brutality and repression of the Syrian regime towards its own people also generate instability in the region. The United States condemns the violence and human rights abuses of the Assad regime and calls for a political transition in Syria that will lead to greater freedom, democracy, and justice. The United States will evaluate the actions of the Syrian government in the future to determine whether to continue or terminate the national emergency.
