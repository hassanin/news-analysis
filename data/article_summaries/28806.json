The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released the Employment Situation Report for December 2020, showing a decrease in employment by 140,000 jobs from November to December. This ended a seven-month streak of job gains, as many states implemented partial lockdowns due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The leisure and hospitality industry, which employs low-wage earners, experienced the largest job loss with 498,000 jobs lost. The report also highlights the regressive nature of government-mandated closures, as the leisure and hospitality industry has been more susceptible to changes in the prevalence of COVID-19 compared to other industries. Despite some gains in the industry, employment in leisure and hospitality was still at only 77 percent of its February level, while other industries reached 96 percent of their pre-pandemic employment levels. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 6.7 percent in December, with Black Americans experiencing a decrease in unemployment to 9.9 percent, the first time it fell below 10 percent since February. Hispanic Americans, however, saw an increase in unemployment to 9.3 percent, likely due to their higher representation in the leisure and hospitality industry. The report emphasizes the need for policymakers to monitor employment trends in response to the evolving dynamics of the pandemic.
