The article is a statement of administration policy regarding H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure Appropriations Act, 2018. The administration supports the bill, which provides funding for defense, military construction, Veterans Affairs, energy and water development, and other purposes for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018. The bill aims to fulfill the President's promise of putting the safety of the American people first by funding operations to defeat ISIS, rebuilding the military, improving missile defense capabilities, and constructing the border wall. The administration also supports the inclusion of $1.6 billion for physical barrier construction along the southwest border. The bill provides $667.7 billion for the Department of Defense and $78.3 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The administration has some objections to certain provisions in the bill, such as the prohibition of a new Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round, reduction in funding for missile defense programs, and reductions to the Counter-ISIL Train and Equip Fund (CTEF) and Coalition Support Fund (CSF). The administration also opposes the continued construction of the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility and the reduction in funding for the disposal of excess facilities at the Department of Energy sites. The administration looks forward to working with Congress as the appropriations process moves forward.
