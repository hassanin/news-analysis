This article announces the continuation of a national emergency with respect to the situation in Zimbabwe. The President declared this emergency in 2003, blocking the property of individuals undermining democratic processes or institutions in Zimbabwe. The actions and policies of these individuals have led to a breakdown in the rule of law, politically motivated violence, and instability in the southern African region. Additional measures were taken in 2005 and 2008 to address this emergency. The President has determined that the threat to the foreign policy of the United States still exists, so the national emergency will continue for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
