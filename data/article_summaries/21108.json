The Normandy Landings, also known as Operation Neptune, took place on June 6, 1944, and played a crucial role in the liberation of Europe during World War II. The invasion was initially planned for May 1944 but was delayed due to a lack of landing craft. Despite adverse weather conditions, General Dwight Eisenhower decided to proceed with the operation. The assault began with an air bombardment followed by the landing of American, British, and Canadian troops. However, the coastal bombing at Omaha Beach was ineffective due to clouds. The airborne divisions also faced difficulties with thick cloud cover and missed their landing zones. The second phase of the operation involved six Allied divisions landing on five beaches. In total, over 160,000 troops, including 73,000 Americans, landed at Normandy. On the first day, none of the assault forces achieved their objectives, and casualties were estimated at 10,000. Over the following days, the Allies gradually expanded their foothold, and the tide turned when German forces were encircled near Falaise. The Allies broke out of Normandy on August 15 and liberated Paris on August 25. The Normandy campaign resulted in high casualties on both sides, with over two million Allied troops landing in northern France and suffering more than 226,386 casualties. German losses included over 240,000 casualties and 200,000 captured. The Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial is the resting place for 9,387 Americans who lost their lives during the landing operations. The cemetery is located on land granted by France to the United States and is one of 14 permanent World War II military cemeteries constructed on foreign soil by the American Battle Monuments Commission. The memorial features a semi-circular colonnade with a bronze statue called "The Spirit of American Youth Rising from the Waves" and is surrounded by pebbles taken from the invasion beach.
