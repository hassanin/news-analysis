The article is a memorandum from Dominic J. Mancini, Acting Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, to regulatory policy officers at executive departments and agencies. The memorandum provides guidelines and procedures for publishing the Spring 2017 Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions. The Unified Agenda is a compilation of each entity's regulatory agenda and is a key component of the regulatory planning mechanism prescribed in Executive Order 12866 and EO 13563. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of managing costs associated with regulatory compliance and highlights the principles and requirements identified in EO 13771, EO 13659, EO 13563, EO 13610, and EO 13609. It also requests agencies to include a preliminary estimate of the total costs or savings associated with their planned fiscal year 2018 significant regulatory actions and offsetting deregulatory actions. The memorandum provides instructions on how agencies should prepare and transmit their Unified Agenda submissions, and suggests ways for agencies to make their submissions more open and informative to the public. Finally, the memorandum provides information on the format and organization of the Spring 2017 edition of the Unified Agenda, and outlines the data elements that should be included for each regulation in the agency agenda.
