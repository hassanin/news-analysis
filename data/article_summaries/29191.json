This executive order, issued by President Donald Trump on March 4, 2019, aims to support employment opportunities for United States military veterans and promote the growth of trained United States mariners. The policy states that members of the United States Armed Forces should receive appropriate credit for their military training and experience towards credentialing requirements as a merchant mariner. The order also emphasizes the importance of a robust merchant marine for national and economic security, as well as for supporting domestic and international trade, military sealift operations, and Federal vessel operations. It acknowledges a shortage of qualified merchant mariners and highlights the need to attract trained and credentialed mariners, particularly from active duty service members and military veterans. The order includes provisions for credentialing support, such as identifying military training and experience that qualifies for merchant mariner credentialing, waiving fees for active duty service members, providing payment for Transportation Worker Identification Credential cards, and ensuring timely certification or verification of sea service for discharged or released service members. The United States Committee on the Marine Transportation System is tasked with pursuing innovative ways to support merchant mariner credentialing and providing annual status reports on its efforts. The executive order concludes with general provisions clarifying that it does not impair existing authorities or create any new rights or benefits enforceable against the United States or its entities.
