Vice President Mike Pence led a discussion with the chief executives and senior leaders of approximately 50 states, territories, and the White House Coronavirus Task Force. They discussed local, state, and federal COVID-19 response and recovery efforts, as well as vaccine distribution and administration planning. The Vice President encouraged governors to collaborate with healthcare professionals in their states to ensure the earlier use of monoclonal antibodies. The discussion also included updates on the recent bipartisan COVID relief package, Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine emergency use authorization, vaccine distribution efforts, ACIP COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, PPE status, data and trends, and continued collaboration at every level of government. The Trump Administration has organized and hosted 45 governors-only briefings since January 2020 to drive effective communication and collaboration.
