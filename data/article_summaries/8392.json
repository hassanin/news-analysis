In a teleconference, a senior administration official provided an update on the relocation of at-risk Afghans to the United States. The official mentioned that the U.S. is conducting one of the biggest airlifts in world history, evacuating American citizens, green card holders, Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants and their families, and other vulnerable Afghans. The individuals are being flown to third-party countries in Europe and Asia as transit hubs, where they undergo rigorous security screenings before being allowed into the United States. The official emphasized that the process involves biometric and biographic security screenings conducted by intelligence, law enforcement, and counterterrorism professionals. The official also discussed the measures being taken to ensure the safety and health of the individuals, such as COVID testing upon arrival and the provision of medical services and assistance in applying for work authorizations. The official acknowledged that the numbers are fluid due to the rapidly evolving situation, but stressed that the goal is to safely and efficiently welcome the individuals while avoiding overburdening military bases and communities in the U.S. The official also mentioned that the Department of Defense is exploring the possibility of utilizing additional military installations if needed. The official did not provide specific numbers on the arrivals or the breakdown of different categories of individuals.
