During a press gaggle aboard Air Force One, Press Secretary Jay Carney discussed several topics. He mentioned that President Obama would be speaking at a school in Denver about the American Jobs Act, specifically focusing on the provisions aimed at modernizing and rebuilding schools. Carney also addressed complaints from the Pakistani Prime Minister about the US statements on its relationship with the ISI, stating that the Haqqani network was responsible for attacks on the US embassy in Kabul and that the Pakistani government needs to take action. He mentioned that the US is always reviewing aid programs to Pakistan and discussing these matters with Pakistani counterparts. Carney expressed disappointment with the announcement of 1,100 settlements in East Jerusalem and reiterated the US position that both sides should take steps towards direct negotiations. He also addressed concerns about surface-to-air missiles missing in Libya and mentioned that the US has been actively engaged with the Transitional National Council (TNC) to secure conventional weapons stockpiles. Carney defended the need for the American Jobs Act, stating that providing assistance to states helps keep teachers and other public employees at work. He called on House Republicans to clarify their opposition to the act and said that the program is designed to put teachers back to work. Carney expressed satisfaction with Congress reaching a one-month extension for government funding and stated that the President's message about the jobs act is having an effect on Congress. He mentioned that the Senate is expected to move forward with legislation in October, although the specific date is yet to be determined.
