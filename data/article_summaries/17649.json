President Obama has declared a major disaster in West Virginia and authorized federal aid to support recovery efforts following a severe winter storm and snowstorm that occurred from December 18-20, 2009. The federal funding will be available to the state, local governments, and certain non-profit organizations for emergency work, facility repairs, and replacements. The affected counties include Boone, Calhoun, Clay, Fayette, Greenbrier, Kanawha, McDowell, Mingo, Nicholas, Pendleton, Pocahontas, Raleigh, Ritchie, Roane, and Wyoming. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has appointed Regis Leo Phelan as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations, and additional designations may be made if requested by the state and deemed necessary based on further damage assessments.
