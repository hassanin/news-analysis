Karen Pence, the Second Lady of the United States, recently showed the Senate Spouses the work being done by Tracy's Kids at Children's National Health System in Washington, DC. Tracy's Kids is an organization that uses art therapy to help young cancer patients and their families cope with the emotional stress and trauma of cancer treatment. The art therapy sessions provided by Tracy's Kids are free of charge and are available at seven locations throughout the United States. During the visit, the Senate Spouses were able to witness an art therapy session and hear success stories from the art therapists themselves. Pence expressed her passion for this therapy and thanked the Senate Spouses for taking the time to understand art therapy. She also thanked Children's National Health System and Tracy's Kids for their work in bringing relief and joy to the lives of children and families affected by cancer.
