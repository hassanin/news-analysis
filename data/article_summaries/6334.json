On September 16, 2022, the President signed three bills into law. The first is H.R. 5754, also known as the "Patient Advocate Tracker Act," which aims to enhance the ability of veterans to submit and track complaints about the delivery of healthcare services by the VA electronically. The second is S. 3103, the "Eliminating Limits to Justice for Child Sex Abuse Victims Act of 2022," which eliminates the federal statute of limitations for minor victims of sexual abuse, human trafficking, forced labor, or child pornography to file civil actions. Lastly, S. 4785 extends the authorization for the special assessment for the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund until September 30, 2022. The President expressed gratitude to the lawmakers who showed leadership in advancing these bills.
