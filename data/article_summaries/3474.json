President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Lebanon, declared in Executive Order 13441 on August 1, 2007, is to continue beyond August 1, 2021. The President cites ongoing activities, such as Iran's arms transfers to Hizballah, which undermine Lebanese sovereignty, contribute to regional instability, and pose a threat to US national security and foreign policy. Therefore, President Biden has determined it necessary to extend the national emergency.
