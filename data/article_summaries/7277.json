Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese recently held a meeting with inter-agency principals to discuss the Colonial Pipeline incident. The meeting focused on updates regarding fuel supply in the affected region and steps that agencies have taken or are considering to address supply shortages. The Department of Transportation has allowed several states, including Alabama, Georgia, and Virginia, to use Interstate highways to transport overweight loads of gasoline and other fuels under existing disaster declarations. The Environmental Protection Agency has issued a second emergency fuel waiver, expanding on a previous waiver, which exempts certain requirements for gasoline in specific areas, including the District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Additionally, the waiver now includes Alabama, Delaware, Georgia, specific counties in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. The Maritime Administration of the Department of Transportation has assessed available assets in the Jones Act fleet for transporting petroleum products within the Gulf and up the Eastern Seaboard. The Department of Homeland Security is prepared to review temporary Jones Act waiver requests from companies that can demonstrate insufficient capacity on Jones Act-qualified vessels to transport fuel to the affected region.
