In this article, President Barack Obama declares the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Cuba. The proclamation modifies and extends the national emergency, authorizing the regulation of the anchorage and movement of vessels. The article states that the descriptions of the national emergency set forth in previous proclamations no longer reflect the current international relations between the United States and Cuba. The United States and Cuba have reestablished diplomatic relations, and the United States is committed to pursuing the normalization of relations with Cuba. The article also mentions that the United States is committed to supporting safe, orderly, and legal migration from Cuba. The Cuban economy is described as relatively weak, leading to an outflow of Cuban nationals towards the United States and neighboring countries. The United States maintains an embargo with respect to Cuba, and unauthorized entry of vessels into Cuban territorial waters is considered a violation of U.S. law and policy. The article emphasizes that a mass migration from Cuba would endanger the security and international relations of the United States. President Obama authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue rules and regulations to regulate the anchorage and movement of vessels. The Secretary is also granted the authority to inspect vessels and take possession and control of them if necessary. The Secretary may request assistance from other departments and agencies of the United States, as well as seek assistance from state and local authorities. The powers and authorities delegated in this proclamation can be further delegated by the Secretary. Any provisions of previous proclamations inconsistent with this proclamation are superseded. The proclamation is to be transmitted to Congress and published in the Federal Register.
