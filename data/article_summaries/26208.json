Vice President Mike Pence delivered remarks at the Uline Distribution Warehouse in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, discussing the importance of passing the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). He praised the success of Uline, a company that started in a basement and has since created thousands of jobs and generated billions of dollars in sales. Pence highlighted the positive impact of President Trump's economic policies, including tax cuts, deregulation, and energy independence. He emphasized the need for Congress to pass the USMCA, which would benefit Wisconsin and the entire country by creating jobs and expanding trade opportunities. Pence called on the people of Wisconsin to reach out to their elected representatives and urge them to support the USMCA. He expressed confidence that the trade deal would pass on a bipartisan basis once Speaker Nancy Pelosi brings it to the floor. Pence concluded by encouraging faith in the President, the American people, and in God for the future of the nation.
