The White House has released a statement by National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice expressing the importance of having a highly qualified Administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in order to address global humanitarian crises. Rice is pleased that Gayle Smith has been confirmed by Senators from both parties as the Administrator of USAID. Smith is described as a humanitarian and a leader of the highest caliber, with a successful track record in shaping global development policy, promoting food security, improving global health, and working on initiatives such as Power Africa and the Ebola response. It is expected that Smith will continue to transform the lives of vulnerable populations and tackle global challenges in her role as Administrator of USAID.
