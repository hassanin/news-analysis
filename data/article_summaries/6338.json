The United States is committed to the eradication of chemical weapons and is leading by example in their destruction. They support the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons' efforts to verify, inspect, and counter chemical weapons. The US encourages other nations to join the Chemical Weapons Convention and calls for accountability for violations, such as Syria's use of sarin and chlorine and Russia's use of Novichok nerve agents. The goal is to create a world where children can grow up without the threat of chemical weapons.
