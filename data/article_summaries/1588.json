President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13818 will continue beyond its anniversary date of December 20, 2022. This decision is based on the prevalence and severity of human rights abuse and corruption originating from outside the United States, which pose a threat to international political and economic stability. Such abuse and corruption undermine essential societal values, impact individuals negatively, weaken democratic institutions, degrade the rule of law, perpetuate violent conflicts, aid dangerous individuals, disrupt economic markets, and pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, President Biden has determined that it is necessary to maintain the national emergency declaration in order to address serious human rights abuse and corruption.
