The article discusses the uncertainty and errors involved in forecasting macroeconomic growth, particularly in relation to the President's proposed policies. It mentions that historical data on Administration macroeconomic forecasts can be used to evaluate the accuracy of growth forecasts. The article presents figures comparing growth in each Administration's first year in office to their initial forecast, as well as how the second set of growth forecasts predicted growth in the current year. The data show that the current Administration is the first on record to have experienced economic growth that meets or exceeds its own forecasts in each of its first two years in office.
