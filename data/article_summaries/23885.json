A new report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers states that failure by Congress to extend unemployment benefits will have severe consequences for Americans. If Congress does not act, two million Americans in December alone and nearly seven million over the next year will lose support that helps them with daily expenses while they search for jobs. This loss of benefits could also result in 600,000 job losses by the end of next year. The report emphasizes that extending unemployment benefits is not only the right thing to do, but also the right economic policy, as it will prevent further hardship and support consumer spending. The holiday season is particularly crucial for providing support to jobless individuals and stimulating the economy, as families tend to spend more during this time.
