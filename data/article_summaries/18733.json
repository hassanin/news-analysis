President Obama has declared a major disaster in Missouri due to a severe winter storm and snowstorm that occurred from January 31 to February 5, 2011. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and emergency protective measures. The assistance will be provided to various counties in Missouri on a cost-sharing basis. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has named Elizabeth Turner as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA.
