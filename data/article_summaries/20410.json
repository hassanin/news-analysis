This article is a notice and message from the White House regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the actions of certain persons undermining the sovereignty of Lebanon or its democratic processes and institutions. The President declared a national emergency in 2007 and ordered measures to block the property of these individuals. Despite some positive developments, such as the establishment of diplomatic relations between Syria and Lebanon, certain persons continue to contribute to instability in Lebanon and pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2007 will continue for another year.
