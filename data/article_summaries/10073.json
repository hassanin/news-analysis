In this statement, President Obama applauds Democrats and Republicans in Congress for coming together to give the United States the opportunity to negotiate strong, high-standard agreements for free and fair trade. He also praises Congress for expanding support for American workers and strengthening economic relations between sub-Saharan Africa and the United States. The President emphasizes the need for more work to be done to support American workers and encourages Congress to pass trade enforcement legislation. He states that his top priority is to grow the economy and strengthen the middle class, and he believes that the United States should write the rules of the global economy rather than countries like China. The President looks forward to signing the bipartisan bills into law once they reach his desk.
