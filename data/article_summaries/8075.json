President Biden's $2 billion American Climate Corps program aims to train and prepare young people for jobs in the clean economy and advance environmental justice. Since its announcement, nearly 50,000 Americans have expressed interest in joining the initiative. To further advance the program, the Biden-Harris Administration is launching virtual listening sessions where prospective applicants and partners can share their priorities. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is also using funding from President Biden's Investing in America agenda to create pathways for young people into environmental justice careers through the American Climate Corps. Furthermore, seven federal agencies, including the Departments of Commerce, Interior, Agriculture, Labor and Energy, EPA, and AmeriCorps, are forming a partnership to guide the initiative's implementation. The partnership will prioritize compensating members, expanding workforce pathways in disadvantaged communities, and improving climate resilience, public health, energy security, and economic opportunity. The administration plans to launch the recruitment portal in spring 2024 and establish the first cohort of American Climate Corps members by next summer.
