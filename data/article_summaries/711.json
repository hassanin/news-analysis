In this press briefing, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre covers several topics. She begins by acknowledging the 100th day since journalist Evan Gershkovich was wrongfully detained by Russian authorities and reiterates the administration's commitment to securing his release. She then introduces National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who gives a preview of President Biden's upcoming trip to the NATO Summit. Sullivan discusses the agenda for the summit, including discussions on strengthening NATO's eastern flank and demonstrating unity in support of Ukraine. He also addresses the provision of cluster munitions to Ukraine, explaining the rationale behind the decision and emphasizing that Ukraine needs artillery to defend itself against Russian aggression. Sullivan emphasizes that the cluster munitions provided to Ukraine have a much lower dud rate than those used by Russia and that Ukraine has provided assurances that it will use the munitions in a way that minimizes civilian harm. The press briefing concludes with Jean-Pierre providing updates on other topics, including the launch of the global coalition to address synthetic drug threats, President Biden's efforts to cut costs for American families, the latest jobs report, and the White House's response to extreme weather events and climate change denial.
