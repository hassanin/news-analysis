In this speech, the President discusses the American Jobs Act and urges Congress to pass it. He emphasizes the need to put more people back to work and provide financial relief to those who are already working. The plan includes creating jobs in various sectors such as construction, teaching, and for veterans. It also includes tax breaks for companies that hire new workers and cuts payroll taxes for individuals and small businesses. The President believes that passing this plan will stimulate the economy and give companies the confidence to invest and hire.
