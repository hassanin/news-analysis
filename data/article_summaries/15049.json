The Obama Administration is launching a new initiative to make government services available on mobile devices. The directive requires major federal agencies to make two key government services accessible on mobile phones within the next year. The administration also aims to make government data more accessible to the public to encourage the development of innovative mobile applications. The goal is to create new opportunities, businesses, and jobs. The initiative is part of a larger digital strategy aimed at maximizing the use of digital information. The administration recognizes that mobile devices are becoming the preferred platform for accessing the internet and wants to ensure that government services are available on mobile devices. The U.S. Chief Information Officer, Steven VanRoekel, is tasked with releasing a roadmap to guide the federal government in adapting to the mobile shift. In conjunction with this strategy, the U.S. Chief Technology Officer, Todd Park, is launching a Presidential Innovation Fellows program to bring in outside innovators to work on projects to make government information more accessible. The Open Data Initiatives program will speed up the release of government data in machine-readable form and stimulate the creation of new apps and services.
