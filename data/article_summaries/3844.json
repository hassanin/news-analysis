The United States is supportive of President Erdogan's decision to send Finland's NATO accession protocols to the Turkish Parliament and hopes for a swift conclusion to the process. The US also encourages Turkey to promptly ratify Sweden's accession protocols and urges Hungary to conclude its ratification process for both Finland and Sweden without delay. Sweden and Finland are seen as strong and capable partners that share NATO's values and will contribute to European security. The United States believes that both countries should become NATO members as soon as possible.
