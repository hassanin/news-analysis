Deputy Secretary of the Department of Energy Daniel Poneman will be leading a delegation to Brazil to launch the U.S.-Brazil Strategic Energy Dialogue. This partnership was announced by President Obama and Brazilian President Rousseff in March 2011. The launch will be co-chaired by Poneman and his Brazilian counterpart, Dr. Márcio Zimmermann. The U.S. delegation will include officials from various departments and agencies, and they will meet with public and private enterprises in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The Strategic Energy Dialogue will focus on developing safe, secure, and affordable energy in an environmentally friendly manner, including oil, natural gas, biofuels, clean energy, and civilian nuclear energy.
