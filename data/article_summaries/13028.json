President Obama visited Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, Nevada, to tour the photovoltaic array and see how solar energy is being used to generate clean electricity. The Nellis solar power system, completed in 2007, is the largest solar photovoltaic array in the United States. It generates more than 30 million kilowatt-hours of clean electricity annually, supplying 25% of the base's total power. The system covers 140 acres of land, including 33 acres of a capped landfill. It consists of over 72,000 solar panels that track the sun to maximize renewable energy. The project cost over $100 million to construct, but through a public/private partnership, the Air Force spent less than $100,000 in capital costs and saved Nellis over $1.2 million in the first year of operation. The Nellis solar power system is a joint venture between the U.S. Air Force, Renewable Ventures, SunPower Corporation, and N.V. Energy. Colonel Howard D. Belote, Commander of the 99th Air Base Wing at Nellis Air Force Base, led President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on the tour. Colonel Belote is responsible for all installation support at Nellis and Creech Air Force Bases, as well as the Nevada Test and Training Range.
