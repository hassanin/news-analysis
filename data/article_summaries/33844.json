During a press briefing, Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert discussed President Trump's executive order on cybersecurity. The order aims to protect federal networks, modernize IT systems, and enhance cybersecurity efforts for critical infrastructure. Bossert emphasized the need to reverse the trend of increasing cyberattacks from both nation states and non-nation state actors. The executive order directs federal departments and agencies to implement the NIST risk-reduction framework, prioritize shared IT services, and centralize risk management. The President's American Technology Council will oversee the modernization effort, while the President's bipartisan advisory commission on election integrity was also announced. The briefing also addressed questions about the firing of FBI Director James Comey and the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
