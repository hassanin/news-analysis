He emphasized that the Roe v. Wade decision was a recognition of a woman's constitutional right to choose and expressed his belief that it was the right decision. He condemned the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade, and highlighted the negative consequences it has had on women's access to healthcare. The President mentioned a specific case in Texas where a woman was blocked from receiving necessary care and had to travel out of state. He criticized the cruelty of politicians forcing women to wait until their lives are in danger before receiving care. President Biden also criticized proposed national bans on abortion and the efforts to limit women's access to medication. He stressed the importance of codifying Roe v. Wade and called on Congress to pass laws that restore its protections for women in every state. The President emphasized the need to stop playing politics with women's lives and highlighted the actions his administration has taken to support women's healthcare. He thanked Vice President Kamala Harris and others for their leadership on this issue and urged the American people to continue voicing their support for reproductive rights. President Biden concluded by stating that the fight to protect women's rights is not over and that their voices will have a final say.
