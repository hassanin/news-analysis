The White House has announced new initiatives to provide more Americans with affordable access to education and job training opportunities. The President will be traveling across the country to highlight the need for affordable, quality career and education choices for students. The initiatives include expanding apprenticeships and making community college free for responsible students. The Department of Labor will award $175 million in American Apprenticeship Grants to train and hire over 34,000 new apprentices in high-growth and high-tech industries. The College Promise Advisory Board, led by Dr. Jill Biden, will work to make two years of community college free and highlight success stories and best practices. The Heads Up America campaign will raise awareness about the importance of community colleges and call on everyone to support making two years of community college free. The initiatives build on the progress made in job-driven training efforts and the success of the America's College Promise proposal to make two years of community college free for responsible students.
