The United States congratulates the Government of Colombia on reaching agreements with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) on a bilateral ceasefire, disarmament, and security guarantees for demobilized combatants. While challenges still exist, this announcement represents significant progress in ending Colombia's 52-year conflict. The United States has been a partner to Colombia through Plan Colombia, providing assistance to strengthen democratic institutions, protect citizens, and improve the lives of the Colombian people. President Obama announced Peace Colombia in February, a new framework for bilateral assistance focused on peace accord implementation. The United States will continue to support Colombia as it works towards a just and lasting peace.
