Second Lady Karen Pence led a call with the current PREVENTS Ambassadors to thank them for their work and encourage them to use their platforms to promote suicide prevention during National Suicide Prevention Month. She also urged the ambassadors to spread the REACH campaign messaging, which includes a pledge for Americans to sign, committing to help prevent suicide and raise awareness of mental health issues. Mrs. Pence emphasized the significant mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to address mental health and suicide prevention practices. A recent CDC report found that a significant percentage of Americans, particularly those between the ages of 18-44, have seriously considered suicide in the past 30 days. Mrs. Pence highlighted the importance of everyone coming together online and in their communities to save lives and build a mentally healthier nation. PREVENTS, established through an executive order by President Trump, aims to empower all Americans to play a role in preventing suicide, with Second Lady Karen Pence serving as the Lead Ambassador.
