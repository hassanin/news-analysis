The article is a summary of the technical understandings related to the implementation of the Joint Plan of Action on the Islamic Republic of Iran's nuclear program. The Joint Plan of Action is an agreement between the P5+1 countries (United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and China) and Iran to limit Iran's nuclear program and provide unprecedented access for international inspectors. The technical understandings specify the actions that Iran will take to limit its enrichment capacity, halt the production of near-20% enriched uranium, and disable centrifuge cascades. Iran has also committed to not fuel the Arak reactor, halt the production and testing of fuel for the reactor, and not construct a facility capable of reprocessing. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will be responsible for verifying and confirming Iran's compliance with these commitments. The P5+1 and EU will provide limited, temporary, and targeted relief to Iran in return for its compliance. The relief includes suspending certain sanctions on Iran's petrochemical exports, import and export of gold and other precious metals, and providing spare parts and services for Iran's civil aviation sector. The P5+1 and EU have also committed to facilitating Iran's access to $4.2 billion in restricted Iranian funds on a set schedule throughout the six-month period of the agreement. The ultimate goal is to pursue a comprehensive resolution that addresses concerns over Iran's nuclear program.
