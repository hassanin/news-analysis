Karen Pence, the Second Lady, recently showcased the work of Tracy's Kids at the Children's National Health System in Washington, DC. Tracy's Kids is an organization that uses art therapy to help young cancer patients and their families cope with the emotional stress and trauma of cancer and its treatment. The organization provides this service at no cost to children and families at seven locations across the United States. During the visit, the Senate Spouses were able to witness an art therapy session and hear success stories from art therapists, parents, and hospital administrators. The art therapists at Tracy's Kids not only alleviate the burden of cancer but also bring relief and joy to the lives of these young patients. Karen Pence expressed her gratitude to the Senate Spouses for taking the time to understand art therapy and thanked Children's National Health System and Tracy's Kids for their important work.
