During a press gaggle on Air Force One en route to Chicago, Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz and Christy Goldfuss, a senior advisor at the Council on Environmental Quality, discussed President Obama's initiative called "Every Kid in a Park." This initiative will provide every fourth-grade student and their families with a free pass to national parks and federal lands and waters for a year starting in September. The aim is to give all Americans, especially children, the opportunity to explore the outdoors and historic sites. In addition to this initiative, the President also announced the designation of three new national monuments: Pullman National Monument in Chicago, Browns Canyon National Monument in Colorado, and Honouliuli National Monument in Hawaii. These designations have widespread community support and aim to preserve important cultural and historical sites. The press gaggle also covered other topics such as the President's support for Rahm Emanuel's reelection campaign, the situation in Greece, Walmart's decision to raise wages for its workers, the situation in Ukraine, and Rudy Giuliani's recent comments about President Obama.
