The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 through 11. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will make its clinical recommendations on vaccinations for this age group soon. The government has secured enough vaccine for all 28 million kids in this age group. Vaccines for kids ages 5 through 11 are specifically formulated for younger children, so none of the vaccines already in use can be used for this age group. The vaccine program for kids is expected to be fully up and running starting the week of November 8th. Parents will have a range of options to get their kids vaccinated, including pediatricians, family doctors, pharmacies, and other trusted providers. The vaccination program for kids will be in addition to the ongoing efforts to vaccinate unvaccinated Americans and provide booster shots. The booster program is off to a strong start, with millions of Americans already receiving booster shots.
