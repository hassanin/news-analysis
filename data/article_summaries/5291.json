The PACT Act, signed by President Biden, marks the most significant expansion of benefits and services for toxic exposed veterans in over 30 years. It addresses toxic exposures that have impacted veterans, their families, and caregivers, providing them with the healthcare and benefits they deserve. The act aims to properly prepare and equip troops and care for them and their families upon their return. It acknowledges the increased health risks veterans face and the difficulty in establishing a direct connection between service and disabilities resulting from military environmental exposures. The legislation is named after Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson, a combat medic who died from lung cancer, and will deliver timely benefits and services to over 5 million veterans. The PACT Act builds on the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to address the harmful effects of environmental exposures on service members.
