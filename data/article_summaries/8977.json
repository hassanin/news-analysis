On February 25, 2021, the United States conducted a targeted military strike in eastern Syria against infrastructure used by Iran-supported non-state militia groups. These groups were responsible for recent attacks against US and Coalition personnel in Iraq. The decision to take military action was made to protect and defend US personnel and partners against these attacks and future threats. The US believes it has the right to act in self-defense when the government of the state where the threat is located is unable or unwilling to prevent such attacks. President Biden directed this action to fulfill his responsibility to protect US citizens and advance national security and foreign policy interests.
