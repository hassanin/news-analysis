This article discusses a proclamation made by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. regarding the adjustment of imports of steel articles into the United States. The Secretary of Commerce previously conducted an investigation and found that steel articles being imported into the US threatened to impair national security. In response, the President imposed a 25 percent ad valorem tariff on steel articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. However, an agreement has been reached between the United States and Japan to address the national security concerns caused by imports of steel articles from Japan. This agreement includes measures such as a tariff-rate quota that restricts the quantity of steel articles imported from Japan without the application of the tariff. The President has determined that imports of specified volumes of eligible steel articles from Japan will no longer threaten national security and will be excluded from the tariff. The article also mentions other provisions and modifications related to the tariffs on steel articles from various countries.
