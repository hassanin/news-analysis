On the anniversary of the fraudulent Belarusian election of August 9, 2020, President Joe Biden has signed an Executive Order (E.O.) imposing further consequences on Belarusian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka and his regime. This E.O. aims to address the ongoing assault on democratic aspirations and human rights of the Belarusian people, transnational repression and abuse, affronts to international norms, and corruption. The order expands the scope of the national emergency declared in E.O. 13405 of June 16, 2006, allowing for the imposition of blocking sanctions on individuals and entities operating in specific sectors of the Belarusian economy. These sectors include defense and related materiel, security, energy, potassium chloride (potash), tobacco products, construction, transportation, and potentially others as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the Secretary of State. The U.S. Department of the Treasury is also issuing its largest round of sanctions to date against Belarusian individuals and entities. The United States welcomes the coordinated steps taken by the United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union in response to the actions of the Lukashenka regime. The Biden administration is following through on its pledge to hold the Belarusian regime accountable by calling for a legitimate international investigation into the Ryanair flight diversion, the release of all political prisoners, an end to the targeting of activists and dissidents, and the initiation of a genuine political dialogue with democratic opposition and civil society figures leading to a free and fair presidential election under OSCE observation. If these steps are not taken, the U.S. government will continue to impose costs on the Lukashenka regime and its support network using the E.O. and other authorities.
