On the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, the United States reaffirms its commitment to end the drug abuse epidemic. The rate of opioid overdose deaths has quadrupled since 1999, with drug overdoses now being the leading cause of accidental death in the US. The proposed Fiscal Year 2018 Budget includes $27.8 billion in drug control efforts, supporting law enforcement, drug treatment facilities, and prevention programs. The administration has also taken executive actions to protect communities, dismantle criminal organizations, and address opioid addiction. Treatment options for addiction have improved, and efforts will be made to expand access to treatment and recovery support programs. The US will collaborate with international partners to restrict drug production and trafficking globally. The goal is to end drug abuse and restore safety and peace to communities.
