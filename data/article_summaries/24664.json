President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the state of Iowa, providing federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred from June 21 to June 28, 2013. The declaration allows for federal funding to be available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. The affected counties include Allamakee, Benton, Buchanan, Butler, Cedar, Clayton, Delaware, Howard, Jones, and Winneshiek. Joe M. Girot has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
