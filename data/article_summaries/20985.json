The article provides an overview of the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, which targets significant foreign narcotics traffickers, their organizations, and operatives. The Kingpin Act aims to deny these individuals and entities access to the U.S. financial system and prohibit trade and transactions with U.S. companies and individuals. The Act authorizes the President to impose sanctions when a foreign person plays a significant role in international narcotics trafficking. The President can designate foreign entities and individuals as "kingpins" and impose sanctions on them. The Department of the Treasury has the authority to make derivative designations of individuals and entities that support or are owned or controlled by designated traffickers. Violators of the Kingpin Act can face criminal penalties and fines. The President has identified three Mexican organizations, the Sinaloa Cartel, Los Zetas, and La Familia Michoacana, as appropriate for sanctions under the Kingpin Act.
