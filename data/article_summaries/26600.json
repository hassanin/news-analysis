He urges Americans to remember those lost to heart disease, raise awareness of its warning signs and symptoms, and commit to a healthier lifestyle. The article highlights the progress made in understanding the causes of heart disease, such as smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, lack of physical activity, obesity, diabetes, and prediabetes. It emphasizes that it is never too late or too early to improve heart health through small changes like adopting a healthy diet and regular exercise.
