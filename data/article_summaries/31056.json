The White House has issued statements and releases supporting President Trump's designation of Mick Mulvaney as Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The White House claims that the law is clear and that Mulvaney is the rightful Acting Director. They also highlight that the CFPB's own General Counsel, who was hired under Richard Cordray, agrees with the Administration's reading of the law. The Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel also supports the White House's legal position. They state that the President has the authority to designate an Acting Director of the CFPB under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (FVRA). The White House further argues that the Obama Administration took a similar position in a case involving a vacancy on the National Labor Relations Board, where they argued that a presidential designation under the FVRA supersedes the succession statute of an independent agency.
