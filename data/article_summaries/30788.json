The executive order issued on March 21, 2019, aims to enhance the quality of postsecondary education in the United States by making it more affordable, transparent, and accountable. The order emphasizes the importance of free and open debate on college and university campuses, as well as the need to address the financial burden of higher education. It calls for institutions to be transparent about the average earnings and loan repayment rates of former students who received Federal student aid, and for the government to make this information readily accessible to the public. The order also promotes greater access to critical information regarding the prices and outcomes of postsecondary education, with the goal of helping individuals make educational choices suited to their needs. It further encourages institutions to promote free inquiry and comply with applicable laws and policies regarding freedom of speech. The order also seeks to align the incentives of institutions with those of students and taxpayers to ensure that institutions share the financial risk associated with Federal student loan programs. Additionally, it aims to help borrowers avoid defaulting on their Federal student loans by educating them about risks, repayment obligations, and repayment options. The order includes provisions for improving transparency and accountability on campus, including the expansion and updating of the College Scorecard to provide program-level and institution-level data. It also calls for reporting requirements and the compilation of information about successful state and institutional efforts to promote students' timely and affordable completion of a postsecondary program of study. The order concludes with general provisions regarding its implementation and its effects.
