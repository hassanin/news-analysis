The White House conducted a background conference call to discuss the aerial resupply of forces fighting against ISIL near Kobani, Syria. The United States military delivered weapons, ammunition, and medical supplies to the forces fighting against ISIL on the ground in Kobani. These supplies were provided by Kurdish authorities in Iraq and were focused on enabling Kurdish forces in Syria to continue their fight against ISIL. The resupply was part of the President's broader strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. The United States has been conducting airstrikes in Kobani to degrade ISIL and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe. The forces fighting on the ground have been in a tough fight for several weeks and were running low on supplies, which prompted the resupply operation. The airdrops were conducted by three U.S. Air Force C-130 aircraft, and the majority of the supplies were successfully delivered to Kurdish forces. The Turkish government was notified in advance of the mission, but their response was not characterized. The United States has been providing support to the Syrian opposition for some time, but this was the first time they provided weapons to the Syrian rebel fighters in Kobani. The resupply operation may not be a one-off, and the United States will assess the needs of the forces fighting in Kobani and explore different ways to provide support. The situation in Kobani remains uncertain and tenuous, and there is a possibility that the town could fall to ISIL. However, the Kurdish resistance on the ground has been impressive, and the airstrikes have slowed ISIL's advances into the city.
