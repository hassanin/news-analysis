President Trump's fiscal year 2018 budget includes $27.8 billion in drug control efforts to combat the opioid epidemic. The budget supports $1.3 billion for Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act programs, 21st Century CURES Act programs, and other opioid-specific initiatives. The goal is to prevent drug use, provide treatment, and support law enforcement efforts. The budget reflects the Trump Administration's commitment to addressing the opioid crisis by investing in public health and public safety. The overall rate of drug use among Americans has been increasing gradually, driven by an increase in marijuana use. Earlier this year, President Trump created the President's Commission on Combatting Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis to study ways to combat drug misuse and make recommendations for improving the federal response to the crisis. The Office of National Drug Control Policy aims to reduce drug use and its consequences by fostering healthy individuals and safe communities.
