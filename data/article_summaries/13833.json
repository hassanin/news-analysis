The White House Press Secretary, Jay Carney, held a press briefing to discuss the sanctions that the United States announced against individuals involved in the situation in Ukraine and Crimea. Carney mentioned that the executive order signed by President Obama allows for a more expansive series of categories that sanctions can be applied against. He also stated that the US has the authority to impose further sanctions depending on what happens in the coming days and weeks. When asked if President Putin could be sanctioned, Carney responded that the authority exists to apply sanctions to a variety of individuals and entities, and that the US will evaluate what the right step is as the situation evolves. Carney also addressed questions about the referendum in Crimea, stating that it was not valid under the Ukrainian constitution and that the actions Russia took make the whole process suspect and illegitimate. He emphasized that the US does not recognize the annexation of Crimea and will continue to press Russia to pursue a diplomatic resolution to the situation. Carney also discussed the meeting between President Obama and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, stating that the US is focused on pressing both sides to make tough decisions in order to move the peace process forward.
