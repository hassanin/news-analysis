In this article, First Lady Jill Biden discusses the importance of patient navigation programs in the fight against cancer. She shares her personal experience with her sister's lymphoma diagnosis and the crucial role that a patient navigator played in providing support and guidance throughout the treatment process. Biden emphasizes the need for improved patient experiences and highlights the Biden Cancer Moonshot initiative, which aims to prevent cancer, provide support to those affected by the disease, and ultimately eradicate it. She praises the effectiveness of patient navigation programs but acknowledges that many medical practices cannot afford to offer them. Biden expresses gratitude to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for working towards a solution that would allow Medicare to cover patient navigation services. She sees this proposed rule as a significant step towards ensuring that critical support is accessible to more individuals in various locations, ultimately leading to longer, healthier, and happier lives. Biden also calls on the private sector to contribute to this cause. She concludes by acknowledging that cancer still evokes fear and isolation, but this proposed rule has the potential to empower patients and their families in the fight against cancer.
