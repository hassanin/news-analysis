The White House has released the first edition of its Bipartisan Infrastructure Law guidebook, which provides comprehensive information on the over 375 programs included in the law. The guidebook aims to help state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments access the benefits of the historic investments in infrastructure. It serves as a roadmap to the funding available under the law and includes an accompanying data file for easy sorting of programs. The Biden-Harris Administration has already made progress in implementing the infrastructure investment, with over $80 billion allocated to states for various projects. The guidebook will be updated in the future with additional information and resources. The Administration also recognizes the strain on state and local capacities and aims to provide technical assistance and support to underserved communities. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law aims to rebuild infrastructure, provide high-speed internet access, and create jobs while advancing equity and resilience to climate change.
