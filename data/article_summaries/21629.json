Leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, under the chairmanship of President Obama, agreed on measures to increase economic growth and job creation in the Asia-Pacific region. They adopted market-driven innovation policies, reduced tariffs, and eliminated barriers to trade in environmental goods and services. These steps aim to expand export opportunities for the US in the fastest-growing region in the world. APEC comprises 21 member economies, representing 2.7 billion consumers, accounting for 44% of world trade, and 55% of global economic output. The US and APEC economies took concrete steps to create a "seamless regional economy" by reducing barriers to trade and investment, supporting green growth and green jobs, and promoting regulatory practices that facilitate trade and investment. APEC has played a central role in reducing tariffs and increasing US exports to the region. Since 1993, US exports to APEC member economies have nearly tripled, supporting five million American jobs.
