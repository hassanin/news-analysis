On the 75th anniversary of D-Day, President Donald Trump paid tribute to the veterans who participated in the invasion of Normandy during World War II. He hugged one of the veterans, Private First Class Russell Pickett, who had been wounded in the first wave of soldiers that landed on Omaha Beach. Pickett had returned to battle after being treated in a hospital and was gravely wounded twice more. President Trump spoke at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial, where 9,388 American service members are buried. He emphasized the significance of D-Day in changing the course of the war and eventually leading to the liberation of Europe from Nazi rule. The president also read the same prayer that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt delivered on the night of June 6, 1944. The commemoration ceremony was attended by leaders from 15 other countries, including Germany, Canada, and France. President Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron visited the Normandy American Cemetery to honor the fallen soldiers. The president acknowledged the sacrifice made by the troops and how it secured a future for the nation and the survival of civilization.
