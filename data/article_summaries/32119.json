President Donald J. Trump has announced his Senate trial counsel, which will be led by Counsel to the President Pat A. Cipollone and Jay Alan Sekulow. They will be joined by several attorneys, including Kenneth Starr, Alan Dershowitz, Pam Bondi, Jane Serene Raskin, Eric D. Herschmann, and Robert Ray. President Trump believes that this team will defend him and our democracy against the baseless impeachment charges brought by House Democrats. He hopes that Congress will focus on the work of the American people and put an end to this partisan and unconstitutional impeachment.
