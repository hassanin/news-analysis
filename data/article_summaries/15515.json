On July 9, 2012, the President signed three bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 33, called the "Church Plan Investment Clarification Act," amends the Securities Act of 1933 to provide an exemption from Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements for church pension plans participating in collective trust funds. 

The second bill, H.R. 2297, makes technical amendments to the District of Columbia Code to facilitate the development of the Southwest Waterfront in the District of Columbia.

The third bill, S. 3187, known as the "Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act," reauthorizes several FDA user fee programs, including the Prescription Drug User Fee Act and the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act. It also increases the FDA's ability to review and approve applications for prescription drugs and medical devices in a timely manner. The bill also authorizes new user fee programs for generic drugs and biosimilar biological products, extends and modifies FDA authorities related to drugs for children, and improves the drug approval process to help reduce drug shortages.
