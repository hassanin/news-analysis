President Trump gave a speech at the Loren Cook Company in Springfield, Missouri, where he discussed the need for tax reform. He expressed his commitment to working with Congress to create a tax code that is simple, fair, and benefits middle-class families. Trump also emphasized the importance of reducing the tax burden on American businesses and bringing back trillions of dollars in wealth that is currently parked overseas. He called on members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, to support pro-American tax reform and create a level playing field for workers and businesses. Trump believes that by implementing these reforms, the United States can add millions of new jobs and give the country a competitive advantage.
