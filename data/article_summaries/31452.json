President Donald J. Trump has declared a state of emergency in Florida and ordered federal assistance to supplement the state's response efforts to Hurricane Isaias. The declaration authorizes the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA to coordinate disaster relief efforts in order to alleviate hardship and suffering caused by the emergency. The assistance will be provided in the form of emergency measures to save lives, protect property and public health, and prevent a catastrophe. FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide necessary equipment and resources. The federal funding for emergency protective measures, including evacuation and shelter support, will be provided at 75 percent. Terry L. Quarles has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. For further information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
