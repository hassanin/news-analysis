Vice President Kamala Harris visited Eastway Middle School in Charlotte, North Carolina to discuss the issue of gun violence and its impact on children. Harris met with students who had experienced gun violence and listened to their perspectives on their rights and the responsibilities of adults. She highlighted the alarming statistics that gun violence is the number one cause of death for children in the United States and that one in five Americans has a family member killed by gun violence. Harris emphasized the need to address the trauma experienced by children and the importance of creating safe spaces for them to express their feelings. She also advocated for reasonable gun safety laws, such as background checks for gun buyers. As part of the administration's initiative, Harris announced $285 million to hire and train mental health counselors in schools, with $12 million allocated for North Carolina. The funding aims to provide support and counseling for students affected by trauma.
