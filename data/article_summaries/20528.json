During a press briefing aboard Air Force One en route to Ethiopia, senior administration officials discussed the upcoming meeting between President Obama and regional leaders to discuss the situation in South Sudan. The officials stated that the IGAD negotiating process is close to finalizing a proposal for the warring parties in South Sudan and that a response is expected by August 17th. They also mentioned that if this proposal fails, there will be discussions on the next steps and potential strategies, including the possibility of a transitional government and the application of additional sanctions. The officials acknowledged the challenges in reaching a successful outcome due to the parties' recalcitrance and divisions within IGAD. They also emphasized the importance of unity among the regional leaders and the need to address the humanitarian situation in South Sudan. The officials noted that besides South Sudan, discussions will also cover other regional security issues, such as counterterrorism and countering violent extremism.
