According to a survey by the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), American manufacturers are more optimistic in 2018 than they have been in at least two decades. In the third quarter, 92.5 percent of manufacturing executives had a positive outlook for their business. This year, manufacturers are on track to record their highest confidence levels in the survey's 20-year history, thanks in part to the Trump administration's economic agenda, which included comprehensive tax reform and reduction in regulations. In addition, employers are expecting to raise wages by 2.7 percent over the next year, the fastest pace since 2001. In September, the US economy added 18,000 manufacturing jobs.
