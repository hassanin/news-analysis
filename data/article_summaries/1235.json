The United States and the European Union (EU) are coming together to update the rules that govern their economic relationship and address global challenges. They share a commitment to the multilateral system and the protection of human rights. The U.S.-EU Summit aims to protect health, climate, and democracy, as well as improve technology. President Biden's participation signifies the U.S.'s dedication to a strong Transatlantic partnership. The leaders will launch the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council to shape the 21st-century economy, deepen trade ties, and align policies on technology and standards. They will also focus on fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, reforming the World Health Organization, and reopening travel safely. Climate change is another priority, with a commitment to becoming net zero greenhouse gas economies by 2050 and conserving land and sea areas. The leaders will work together to support democracy, combat corruption, and protect human rights. They will also address foreign policy concerns, such as Belarus, China, Iran, Russia, and migration.
