The President is urging Congress to pass an agreement that will prevent a tax hike on working Americans. The agreement will extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance. The President thanks the American people for their input in the debate and emphasizes that this agreement will make a real difference in people's lives. It also includes reforms to discourage layoffs and connect workers with jobs, as well as investments in innovation and a nationwide public safety network. The President promises to sign the agreement into law as soon as Congress sends it to his desk, but states that more needs to be done to help businesses create jobs and provide security for middle class families.
