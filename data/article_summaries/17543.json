National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice has issued a statement condemning the attacks on hospitals and first responders in Syria. Reports from aid organizations indicate that all remaining hospitals in Eastern Aleppo, as well as first responder staging locations, have been destroyed in attacks by forces loyal to the Asad regime, with support from Russia. Rice emphasizes that there is no excuse for these actions and highlights the bravery of the Syrian Civil Defense "White Helmets" and medical professionals who risk their lives to save innocent civilians. The United States has been working with international partners to support relief efforts and provide humanitarian aid to the Syrian people, who have been suffering due to Asad's war against his own people, with assistance from Moscow. Rice joins allies in demanding the immediate cessation of these attacks and calls on Russia to deescalate violence and facilitate humanitarian aid for the Syrian people.
