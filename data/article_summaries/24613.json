During a flight between Santiago, Chile and El Salvador, President Obama made three calls. The first call was with his national security team to get an update on military activity in Libya and review diplomatic efforts. The second call was with President Sarkozy of France, and the third call was with Prime Minister Cameron of the United Kingdom. They discussed the progress made in halting Qaddafi forces and the establishment of a no-fly zone. They also agreed that NATO should play a key role in the command structure for enforcing the no-fly zone. The President also had a bilateral meeting with President Funes of El Salvador and did interviews with CNN Espanol and Univision. He also visited the Tomb of Father Romero and attended an official dinner. There were discussions about the role of NATO and other partners in the command and control structure, and the progress made in Libya was discussed. The opposition in Libya was pleased with the advances made against the Qaddafi regime, but their next steps were not discussed. The President spoke with the Emir of Qatar, who offered to contribute to the effort, and there was political support from the Arab League. The command and control issue is still being resolved, and once it is resolved, the U.S. participation will transition to supporting the enforcement of the no-fly zone led by allies and partners. There were no specific plans for a speech or address by the President, but he has been consistent in communicating the goals of the mission. The pilots of the downed aircraft are safe. There was also mention of a personal appeal for help with an investigation into a death, but no further details were given. The schedule for the next day was not yet determined.
