President Biden addressed the audience, thanking Gretchen Carlson for her advocacy and acknowledging the survivors of sexual harassment present. He emphasized the prevalence of sexual harassment in the workplace and the importance of giving survivors a voice and a fair chance to address their experiences. The President signed a bipartisan bill into law that aims to address the issue of forced arbitration in cases of sexual harassment and assault. Forced arbitration prevents survivors from going to court and keeps proceedings secret, often favoring employers. The President expressed his belief that no worker should have to give up their access to justice and supported legislation to ban mandatory arbitration for all employment disputes. He also highlighted the need to strengthen and renew the Violence Against Women Act. The President signed the bill into law and expressed his hope for further progress in addressing sexual harassment and assault.
