The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law in December 2017, has enacted several tax cuts and reforms. The article discusses the stagnant wage growth that has been observed over the past two decades. Between 2007 and 2016, wage growth was negative, which is the first time this has happened since at least 1980. The article suggests that one possible reason for this departure from historical wage growth is the decline in capital deepening, which measures capital per worker and influences productivity. The article also highlights the potential role of policies that discouraged capital investment in the US, such as the corporate tax rate. With the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the corporate tax rate is expected to encourage investment and wage growth in America. Additionally, the article mentions that the corporate tax reform is projected to increase GDP growth by 0.3 to 0.5 percent this year, with additional growth expected through 2019.
