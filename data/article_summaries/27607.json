The Office of National Drug Control Policy, in partnership with the Department of Justice and other federal departments and agencies, has released a training video to educate first responders on how to protect themselves from the harmful effects of fentanyl exposure. The video provides recommendations on protective actions to take, including the use of personal protective equipment such as gloves and respirator masks. It was developed with the help of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and involved input from various stakeholder associations representing medical, public health, law enforcement, fire/EMS, and occupational safety and health disciplines. The video can be accessed on the Trump White House website.
