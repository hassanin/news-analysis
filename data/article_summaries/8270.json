Vice President Kamala Harris recently convened voting rights leaders in Atlanta, Georgia to discuss ongoing threats to ballot access and the actions being taken to counter those threats. During the discussion, Harris called out extremists for their assault on the freedom to vote, highlighting the introduction of over 300 anti-voter bills last year. She also outlined steps that the Biden-Harris Administration is taking to protect voting rights, including making voter registration information available in 17 languages on vote.gov. Harris urged Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The voting rights leaders expressed concerns about mis- and disinformation, voter intimidation, harassment of poll workers, and mass ballot challenges. They also shared the work they are doing to protect voters, such as engaging young people and rural communities, recruiting election and poll workers, and educating voters about their rights. Harris thanked them for their efforts and announced that the next convening would take place in February. Since taking office, President Biden and Vice President Harris have been working to protect and advance voting rights for all Americans. Harris has brought together leaders from various communities to strategize on ensuring access to the ballot.
