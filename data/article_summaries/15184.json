The Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction (Global Partnership) is an initiative launched in 2002 to prevent terrorists and states from acquiring or developing weapons of mass destruction. Initially focused in Russia and other former Soviet Union states, the Global Partnership has since expanded globally and now includes 29 partner countries. It aims to fund and coordinate projects in chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological security, as well as work on countering weapons of mass destruction terrorism risks. The Global Partnership collaborates with international organizations and non-governmental stakeholders, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and INTERPOL. The United States is a major participant in the Global Partnership, contributing both funding and expertise to improve nuclear and radiological security.
