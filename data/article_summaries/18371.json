The White House Office of the Press Secretary has announced the appointment of the 2013-2014 Class of White House Fellows. The Fellows come from diverse backgrounds and professions and have shown a strong commitment to public service and leadership. The program was created in 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson to give promising American leaders first-hand experience with the workings of the Federal government and to increase their sense of participation in national affairs. The Fellows also take part in an education program designed to broaden their knowledge of leadership, policy formulation, and current affairs. Community service is another essential element of the program, and Fellows participate in service projects throughout the year in the Washington, DC area. Selection as a White House Fellow is highly competitive and based on a record of professional achievement, evidence of leadership potential, and a proven commitment to public service. The 2013-2014 Class of Fellows includes individuals from various fields such as chemistry, education, law, medicine, and the military.
