The White House will host the first-ever White House Tribal Youth Gathering on July 9, 2015, in Washington, DC. The gathering aims to provide American Indian and Alaska Native youth with the opportunity to interact with senior Administration officials and the White House Council on Native American Affairs. This event is a collaboration between the White House and UNITY Inc. and is part of the President's Generation Indigenous (Gen-I) initiative, which focuses on improving the lives of Native youth through new investments and increased engagement. The Gen-I Native Youth Challenge invites Native youth and organizations to join the National Native Youth Network and offers them the chance to attend the White House Tribal Youth Gathering. More details about the conference will be released at a later date.
