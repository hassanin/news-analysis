This article is a technical trade proclamation issued by the President of the United States regarding Bangladesh. The proclamation states that Bangladesh's designation as a beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) is suspended due to its failure to provide internationally recognized worker rights. The proclamation also discusses modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) and the waiver of competitive need limitations for certain eligible articles from beneficiary developing countries. Additionally, the proclamation includes technical corrections to the HTS to maintain intended tariff treatment for certain products covered under trade agreements. The proclamation concludes by stating that any provisions of previous proclamations and executive orders inconsistent with this proclamation are superseded.
