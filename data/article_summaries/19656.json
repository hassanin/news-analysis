President Obama will be hosting the second White House Science Fair on February 7th, where he will highlight the winners of various science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) competitions from across the country. The event aims to inspire students to excel in these subjects and will feature exhibits of student work, ranging from breakthrough research to new inventions. The President will also announce key steps that the Administration and its partners are taking to help more students excel in math and science and earn degrees in these subjects.

Some of the exhibits include a student making and starting a small business to sell his invention, a student designing a more efficient way to collect solar energy, a student designing targeted cancer treatment using nanotechnology, a teenage CEO inventing dissolvable sugar packets to reduce waste, and a team of Girl Scouts seeking a patent on a prosthetic hand device.
