The United States has taken several immediate steps to demonstrate its commitment to Article 5 collective defense and reassure NATO allies, including Romania, in response to Russia's occupation and attempted annexation of Ukrainian territory. These steps include maritime deployments to the Black Sea, air-to-air refueling missions, enhancements to previously planned operations, ongoing steady-state measures, and the European Phased Adaptive Approach. The US has deployed naval vessels to the Black Sea, conducted port visits and bilateral operations with Romania and Georgia, and conducted refueling missions in support of NATO flights. The US is also exploring options for increasing the readiness of its NRF-committed Brigade Combat Team. Additionally, there are approximately 1,000 US troops in Romania, including Marines, sailors, airmen, and soldiers. The Black Sea Rotational Forces, based out of Romania, include 250 Marines and sailors tasked with maintaining positive relations with partner nations and providing rapid crisis response capabilities. The US is also contributing to European missile defense through the Aegis Ashore sites in Romania and Poland. The US force presence in Europe consists of approximately 67,000 service members, and the US has committed several thousand service members to the NRF. The US will also send a battalion-sized unit to Europe twice a year for up to two months per rotation.
