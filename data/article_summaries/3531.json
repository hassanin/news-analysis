President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to the situation in Nicaragua will continue beyond November 27, 2022. This emergency was initially declared in Executive Order 13851 on November 27, 2018, and additional measures were taken in Executive Order 14088 on October 24, 2022. The decision to continue the national emergency is based on the ongoing situation in Nicaragua, including the violent response by the Nicaraguan government to protests that began on April 18, 2018. The regime of Ortega-Murillo is accused of systematically dismantling and undermining democratic institutions, using indiscriminate violence and repressive tactics against civilians, and engaging in corruption that destabilizes Nicaragua's economy. President Biden believes that this situation poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
