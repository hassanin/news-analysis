President Biden has announced the appointments of Neera Tanden as Assistant to the President and Domestic Policy Advisor, Stefanie Feldman as Assistant to the President and Staff Secretary, and the promotion of Zayn Siddique to Principal Deputy of the Domestic Policy Council. Tanden, who currently serves as Senior Advisor and Staff Secretary, will continue to drive the formulation and implementation of Biden's domestic policy agenda. She has extensive experience in public policy and has served three Presidents. Feldman, one of Biden's longest-serving advisors, has been appointed Staff Secretary and will provide advice and counsel to the President. Siddique, currently Deputy Assistant to the President for Economic Mobility, will now serve as Principal Deputy Director of the Domestic Policy Council. These appointments reflect the administration's commitment to diverse representation, as Tanden will be the first Asian-American to lead any of the three major White House policy councils.
