During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders announced the release of a framework for responsible immigration reform. The framework includes four pillars: border security, DACA legalization, ending extended-family chain migration, and eliminating the visa lottery. Sanders also announced some of the guests who will be sitting in the First Lady's Box during the State of the Union Address, including a skilled welder, parents of two girls murdered by MS-13 gang members, a blind double amputee Marine, and a police officer who adopted a baby from parents suffering from opioid addiction. Sanders addressed questions about the Deputy Director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, stepping down, stating that the decision was not made by the White House and that the President had no involvement. She also mentioned that the White House wants full transparency regarding the release of the Nunes memo and that the President's family, excluding Barron, will be present at the State of the Union. Sanders emphasized the positive state of the union, mentioning the booming economy, progress against ISIS, and the remaking of the judiciary. She also discussed the administration's efforts to improve unemployment rates for all Americans and expressed hope for a greater relationship with the African American community.
