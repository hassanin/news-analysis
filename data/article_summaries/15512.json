The proclamation recognizes the important role that employers play in supporting these service members by accommodating their participation in the National Guard and Reserve, bearing financial and organizational responsibilities, and providing support to their families. The proclamation calls on all Americans to express their gratitude to the members of the National Guard and Reserve and their employers, and encourages State and local officials, private organizations, and military commanders to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
