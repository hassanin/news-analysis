President Biden's economic plan has sparked a boom in American electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing, creating new job opportunities and union positions across the country. Companies like Toyota, Honda, Ford, General Motors, and Panasonic have made investments in EV manufacturing in various states, including North Carolina, Michigan, Ohio, Missouri, and Kansas. President Biden aims to have EVs account for 50% of all vehicles sold in the United States by 2030, and his economic agenda, which includes "Made in America" policies, has encouraged domestic manufacturing of EVs, EV chargers, and batteries. The Inflation Reduction Act is also making EVs more affordable for consumers. Since President Biden took office, companies have announced over $36 billion in EV manufacturing investments and $48 billion in battery investments in the US. Automakers are responding to President Biden's leadership by creating more models of EVs, including trucks and SUVs. The number of available plug-in models has now exceeded 70, with more affordable options on the way. The passing of President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has provided an opportunity to increase domestic manufacturing by requiring the use of Made in America content. This will stimulate private sector investments, strengthen supply chains, and create union jobs. The Department of Transportation has proposed that federally-funded EV chargers be built in the US with over 55% domestic content starting in January 2023. The proposal also includes workforce standards, such as the Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program (EVITP), to ensure the safety and reliability of charging stations and create skilled union jobs. Additionally, the federal fleet is set to lead by example, with the goal of having 100% of new light-duty federal vehicles be zero-emission by 2027.
