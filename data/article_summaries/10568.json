The article discusses President Obama's State of the Union address and his proposal for a new retirement account called MyRA. MyRA is a simple and safe retirement account that is targeted towards people who are not currently participating in any retirement savings. It has a low threshold for participation, with a minimum of $25 to open an account and minimum contributions of $5 per pay period. The account is modeled on the Roth IRA and the contributions are after taxes, while the income is tax-free until retirement. The account will roll over at $15,000 into a different investment vehicle.
