The Senate has ratified the Kigali Amendment, which aims to phase down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), super-polluting chemicals that contribute to climate change. This bipartisan move is expected to create 33,000 new manufacturing jobs, increase exports by $4.8 billion annually, and boost economic output by $12.5 billion each year. By ratifying the amendment, the United States is taking a leading role in combating climate change and protecting communities from extreme impacts. The article acknowledges the support of Democrats, Republicans, industry leaders, and environmental organizations in this effort. The President expresses gratitude to Chairman Menendez, Ranking Member Risch, and Senators Carper and Kennedy for their leadership and looks forward to signing the instrument of ratification.
