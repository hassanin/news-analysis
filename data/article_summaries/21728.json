First Lady Michelle Obama will be hosting a student workshop called "A Celebration of Song" as part of the "In Performance at the White House" series. The workshop will involve 60 middle school students from the Greater Washington region who will have the opportunity to write and perform their own songs with artists such as Smokey Robinson, Keb' Mo', MC Lyte, Esperanza Spalding, and Trombone Shorty. The workshop will take place before an evening concert in the East Room, which is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act. The concert will feature performances by various artists including Buddy Guy, Queen Latifah, Audra McDonald, James Taylor, and Usher. The evening performance will be broadcasted on PBS stations in January 2016 and will also be featured on the American Forces Network for service men and women and civilians at U.S. Department of Defense locations worldwide. This event is the fifteenth "In Performance at the White House" program during President Barack Obama's administration.
