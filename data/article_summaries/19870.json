On January 24, 2012, U.S. Special Operations Forces conducted a successful operation in Somalia to rescue a U.S. citizen, Jessica Buchanan, who had been kidnapped by a group linked to Somali pirates and financiers. A Danish national, Poul Hagen Thisted, who was also kidnapped with Buchanan, was rescued in the operation as well. The operation was carried out by a small number of joint combat-equipped U.S. forces after receiving reliable intelligence on the hostages' location. The forces left Somalia on January 25, 2012. President Barack Obama directed this action to protect U.S. citizens and national security interests, exercising his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. This letter is provided to Congress in accordance with the War Powers Resolution to keep them informed, and the President expresses his appreciation for their support.
