President Donald J. Trump and his administration are taking action to address the opioid epidemic in the United States. In partnership with the National Safety Council, the administration has unveiled the "Prescribed to Death" opioids memorial in Washington. The memorial features engravings of 22,000 people who died in 2015 from prescription opioid addiction. President Trump declared the opioid epidemic a Nationwide Public Health Emergency last October and has announced initiatives to reduce opioid abuse, cut off the illicit drug supply, and reduce over-prescription. The administration aims to cut nationwide opioid prescriptions by one-third over the next three years and strengthen criminal penalties for those involved in dealing and trafficking illicit drugs. The memorial also provides resources for patients, such as "Opioids: Warn Me" labels for insurance cards and pre-paid mail envelopes for safe disposal of excess prescription opioids. The administration is committed to ending the scourge of drug addiction in America.
