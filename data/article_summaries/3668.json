President Biden has signed an Executive Order to amend the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) in order to strengthen the military justice system's response to gender-based violence. This Executive Order implements key recommendations from the Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault in the Military and establishes sexual harassment as a specific offense under the UCMJ. It also strengthens the military justice response to prosecuting cases of domestic violence and criminalizes the wrongful broadcast or distribution of intimate visual images. These actions build on the military justice reform signed into law last month through the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which includes the shift of legal decisions from commanders to independent prosecutors in cases of sexual assault, domestic violence, and other serious crimes. The Biden administration is committed to ending gender-based violence and has taken additional steps, such as directing funding for domestic violence and sexual assault prevention and services and releasing the National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality. The administration will continue to advance prevention, promote safe military climates, and provide support for survivors of gender-based violence in the military.
