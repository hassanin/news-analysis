President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the state of California due to severe winter storms, flooding, and mud flows that occurred between January 17 and February 6, 2010. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The funding will be available to governments and nonprofit organizations for emergency work, facility repairs, and hazard mitigation measures. Michael H. Smith has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
