The White House has issued a fact sheet outlining improvements to student loan repayment options. The goal is to make higher education more affordable and ensure that responsible borrowers are aware of their repayment options. The President has already extended Pell Grants to 3 million more students and signed a tax credit to help middle-class families cover tuition costs. However, high debt levels may discourage potential students from enrolling and hinder graduates from starting businesses or pursuing public service careers. The administration has been working to improve repayment options, including capping monthly payments at 10% of discretionary income for borrowers starting in 2014. To streamline the process and improve information available to borrowers, a Presidential Memorandum will be issued to create a streamlined online application process for income-based repayment (IBR). The Department of Education will also enhance online and mobile resources for loan repayment options and develop a tool to help students make better financial decisions. Additionally, borrowers will be made aware of the IBR option before leaving school, and a model exit counseling module will be provided for institutions of higher education. These improvements will be implemented in the coming months.
