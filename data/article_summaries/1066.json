In this letter, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. reports that he has issued an Executive Order to take additional steps in response to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13851. The additional measures are aimed at increasing targeted pressure on the Ortega-Murillo regime in Nicaragua to change its behavior. The President cites the violent response by the Nicaraguan government to protests, the dismantling of democratic institutions, the use of violence against its people, and corruption leading to economic destabilization as reasons for the need for these measures. The President also mentions the shrinking democratic space in the country since the November 2021 elections, with the closure of non-governmental organizations and harsh conditions for political prisoners. These human rights abuses and threats to national security and foreign policy of the United States justify the amendment of Executive Order 13851.
