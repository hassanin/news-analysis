On April 11, 2016, the President signed into law S. 1180, also known as the "Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Modernization Act of 2015." This act requires FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) to update and implement the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS). The purpose of IPAWS is to enable Federal, State, tribal, and local governments to effectively alert the public in areas that are at risk due to natural disasters, acts of terrorism, and other threats to public safety.
