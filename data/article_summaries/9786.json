President Obama has signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 after vetoing an earlier version of the bill that did not provide adequate funding for national defense. The revised bill includes funding changes and important reforms to the military retirement system and other military compensation programs. However, the President expressed disappointment that the Congress has failed to take action to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, stating that maintaining the facility weakens national security and damages relationships with allies. The President also expressed disappointment that meaningful reforms to reduce wasteful overhead and modernize military healthcare were not included in the bill.
