Yesterday, senior White House officials hosted a roundtable with national civil rights leaders to discuss how the Administration plans to advance equity and racial justice through the implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The officials outlined President Biden's commitment to ensuring that federal infrastructure funding reaches underserved communities, addresses persistent poverty, creates equitable job opportunities, narrows wealth gaps, improves accessibility for people with disabilities, and advances civil rights. They also expressed gratitude to the civil rights leaders for their advocacy and partnership in advancing equitable implementation of the law. During the roundtable, civil rights leaders shared ideas on how the law can lead to equitable outcomes in underserved communities and make necessary investments in communities of color, those facing persistent poverty, Tribal and territorial communities, and urban and rural communities that have experienced disinvestment or harmful infrastructure projects. They also emphasized the importance of collaboration with businesses, workers, and communities to achieve these goals.
