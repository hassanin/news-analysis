The article is a press gaggle by Press Secretary Jay Carney, who is on a trip with President Obama to Fort Bragg. Carney discusses the President's visit to the troops and emphasizes their sacrifice and professionalism. He also mentions an encounter the Speaker of the House had with reporters, where he failed to name any small businesses affected by a surtax on millionaires and billionaires. Carney argues that the Republican talking point against the tax increase is false. He then addresses questions about the payroll tax cut extension, the continuing resolution, and the economic message behind the President's visit to Fort Bragg. Carney explains that the President's position on the Iraq war has not changed and that history will judge whether it was worth it. He also discusses the President's commitment to ensuring veterans have job opportunities and the challenges they face in a tough economy. Carney ends the gaggle by addressing questions about the influence of Iran in Iraq and the President's upcoming visits with troops.
