White House Gender Policy Council Director Jennifer Klein and White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director Julie Chavez Rodriguez recently led a meeting with state legislative leaders to discuss protecting access to reproductive health care. This meeting comes in response to the passage of proactive reproductive rights measures in several states during the 2022 legislative session. The states mentioned include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Washington. These states have taken action to protect and expand access to reproductive health care, which stands in contrast to the wave of abortion bans and restrictions that have been passed in other states.

During the meeting, state legislative leaders shared the steps they have taken so far to protect access to abortion and discussed their plans for further expanding care. They also discussed ways in which the Biden Administration can support state and local efforts. Senior White House officials expressed their gratitude for the leaders' efforts and reaffirmed their support for state action to strengthen reproductive rights.
