On June 23, 2009, President Obama declared an emergency in the State of Oklahoma due to the record snowfall that occurred in March of that year. This declaration allowed for federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts in the affected area. The counties of Beaver, Ellis, Woods, and Woodward were eligible for federal funding. The assistance provided was for emergency protective measures undertaken to save lives and protect public health, safety, and property. W. Craig Fugate, the Administrator of FEMA, named Douglas G. Mayne as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. For more information, contact FEMA at (202) 646-4600.
