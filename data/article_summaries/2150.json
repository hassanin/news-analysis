In a report to the Congress of the United States, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. states that he has issued an Executive Order terminating the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13712 of November 22, 2015, and revoking that Executive Order. The national emergency was declared in response to the situation in Burundi, which included violence against civilians, political repression, and threats to peace and security. The President has determined that the situation in Burundi has significantly improved over the past year, including the transfer of power after elections in 2020, decreased violence, and President Ndayishimiye's pursuit of reforms. Therefore, the President deems it necessary to terminate the national emergency and revoke the previous order.
