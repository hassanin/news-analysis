President Biden's Administration is facilitating the air shipment of Nestlé Health Science Alfamino® Infant and Alfamino® Junior formula from Luxembourg to Chicago on August 3. This delivery will include approximately 259,131 8-ounce bottles of formula, weighing around 19,291 pounds. The formula will primarily be distributed to hospitals and home health care providers and is intended for use under medical supervision. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has allowed Nestlé to export additional infant formula into the U.S., and the company plans to bring approximately 42 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents into the market. President Biden launched Operation Fly Formula to expedite the import of infant formula, partnering with various government agencies to ensure formula meets U.S. health and safety standards and reaches store shelves, hospitals, and home health care providers faster. Operation Fly Formula has already transported nearly 64 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents to the U.S. The Biden Administration has also invoked the Defense Production Act, reached a consent agreement with Abbott Nutrition to reopen a facility, and issued FDA guidance to safely import formula not currently produced for the U.S. market.
