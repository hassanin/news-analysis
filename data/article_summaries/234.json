The Inflation Reduction Act is being hailed as the largest investment in climate change mitigation in history. It includes measures such as offering working families $1,000 per year in savings through rebates for purchasing energy-efficient appliances and weatherizing homes. The act also provides tax credits for heat pumps, rooftop solar, and both new and used electric vehicles. The installation of 500,000 charging stations will be handled by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), while laborers, iron workers, operating engineers, and sheet metal workers will be responsible for building the necessary roads, highways, and bridges. The aim is to make Infrastructure Decade a reality, with over 25,000 infrastructure projects already announced in 4,500 towns across the country. Union workers will play a vital role in transforming America and completing these projects.
