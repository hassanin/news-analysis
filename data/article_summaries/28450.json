President Donald J. Trump has signed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Transition Authorization Act of 2017, the first comprehensive NASA authorization passed by Congress in more than six years. The bill demonstrates bipartisan support for NASA and aims to ensure that the agency remains at the forefront of exploration and discovery. The Act authorizes the development and execution of a long-range plan for deep space human exploration, invests in science, technology, and aeronautics portfolios, and endorses efforts to nurture a new commercial market that will boost the economy and create more jobs. It also guarantees improved healthcare for astronauts. The President's proposed $19.1 billion budget for NASA, along with the Authorization Act, provides a framework for NASA's future and reaffirms the agency's commitment to its core missions.
