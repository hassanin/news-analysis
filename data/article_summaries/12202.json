Vice President Joe Biden announced $300 million in funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for the Clean Cities Program. The program aims to expand the use of clean and sustainable vehicles and develop the necessary fueling infrastructure. The funding will help reduce carbon emissions, increase energy security, and decrease reliance on foreign oil. State and local governments, as well as transit authorities, can apply for the funding to support alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles projects. The program also includes support for refueling infrastructure, public awareness campaigns, and training programs. The pilot projects are expected to create tens of thousands of jobs.
