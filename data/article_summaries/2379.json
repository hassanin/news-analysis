The White House has released state-by-state fact sheets that emphasize the urgent need for investments proposed by President Biden in the American Jobs Plan. These fact sheets highlight various infrastructure needs in each state, such as the number of bridges and miles of road in poor condition, the percentage of households without broadband access, and the funding required for water infrastructure. This release is part of a series of fact sheets that showcase the benefits of the American Jobs Plan for communities. Additional fact sheets on different issues will be released in the future. The American Jobs Plan aims to create jobs, rebuild infrastructure, and position the United States competitively against China. The fact sheets are categorized by state and issue, including racial equity and support for rural communities.
