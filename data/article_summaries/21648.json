On November 14, 1979, President Obama declared a national emergency with respect to Iran due to the unusual and extraordinary threat it posed to the United States' national security, foreign policy, and economy. This national emergency has not yet been resolved, and the process of implementing agreements with Iran is still ongoing. As a result, President Obama has decided to continue the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
