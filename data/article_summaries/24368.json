President Barack Obama has proclaimed January 2015 as National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month in the United States. The proclamation acknowledges that although the country has a history of slavery, it now serves as a beacon of hope for those who value freedom and opportunity. However, human trafficking remains a significant issue both domestically and globally. Millions of men, women, and children are victims of modern-day slavery, facing various forms of exploitation. The United States is actively working to combat human trafficking by prosecuting perpetrators, assisting victims in recovery, and developing tools and initiatives to prevent and respond to this crime. The government is also collaborating with international partners and faith-based organizations to strengthen counter-trafficking efforts worldwide. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of individual action in ending slavery, such as demanding products free of forced labor and ensuring supply chains do not exploit individuals. It calls upon businesses, organizations, families, and all Americans to observe the month with appropriate programs and activities.
