President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Mississippi due to severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred from April 23-24, 2010. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Affected individuals in five counties are eligible for assistance, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other recovery programs. Federal funding is also available for debris removal, emergency protective measures, and hazard mitigation measures. Michael Bolch has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Damage surveys are ongoing, and additional counties and assistance may be designated once assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone.
