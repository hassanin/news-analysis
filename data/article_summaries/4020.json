On July 24, 2011, President Biden declared a national emergency due to the activities of significant transnational criminal organizations, citing threats to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States. On March 15, 2019, additional measures were taken to address this national emergency. The President now states that these organizations continue to pose a significant threat, and therefore, the national emergency must continue beyond July 24, 2023. This declaration is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act, and the notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
