This article provides background information on President Obama's visit to Miami Central Senior High School. The visit is aimed at discussing the importance of investing in education to ensure a successful future. The school, which has historically been one of Miami's lowest achieving schools, has received funding through the School Improvement Grant (SIG) program. Miami Central Senior High School has implemented the turnaround model, which involves replacing the principal, rehiring less than half the teachers, adopting a new governance structure, and implementing curriculum reform, professional development, and extended learning time. The school has also received additional instructional support and has implemented various interventions such as common planning among teachers, the use of technology, and a positive behavior support system. Prior to receiving SIG funds, the school had already made improvements, moving from an "F" to a "D" on the state's report card, and then to a "C" last year. The school has also seen improvements in graduation rates and has implemented programs to empower students to become entrepreneurs.
