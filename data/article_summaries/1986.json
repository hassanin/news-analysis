President Biden has signed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2024 into law. The Act provides appropriations for the Department of Defense, Department of Energy national security programs, Department of State, and the Intelligence Community. It aims to build the military necessary for deterring future conflicts and supporting service members and their families. However, the President raises concerns about certain provisions of the Act. Section 1033 and 1031 continue to prohibit the transfer of Guant√°namo Bay detainees to certain foreign countries and the United States, respectively. The President believes these provisions limit the executive branch's ability to determine the prosecution and release of detainees. The President urges Congress to eliminate these restrictions. Additionally, certain provisions of the Act require the President and other officials to disclose highly sensitive classified information to congressional committees. The President asserts that the Constitution grants him the authority to protect national security by preventing the disclosure of such information. He expects the congressional committees to respect this authority while fulfilling their oversight and legislative functions. The President also notes that some provisions may interfere with his constitutional authority to articulate the positions of the United States in international negotiations or forums. However, he will make efforts to comply with these provisions while preserving his discretion. Lastly, the Act includes a provision that requires recipients of certain Department of Defense advertising contracts to certify that they will not place advertisements based on personal or institutional political preferences or biases. The Department of Defense will implement this certification while ensuring compliance with the First Amendment.
