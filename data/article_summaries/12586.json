President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Tennessee, providing federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following a severe winter storm that occurred from March 2-4, 2014. The declaration allows for federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in several counties. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding. Terry L. Quarles has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact the FEMA News Desk.
