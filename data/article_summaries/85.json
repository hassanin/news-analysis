The passing of Sidney Poitier, a renowned actor and advocate, has saddened Jill and the author. Poitier's work on and off the screen carried immense dignity, power, and grace that had a profound impact on the world. He was not only one of the finest actors in history but also an icon whose performances in films such as The Defiant Ones, A Raisin in the Sun, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, and In the Heat of the Night reflected and challenged America's racial attitudes in the 1950s and 1960s. Poitier's on-screen presence, warmth, depth, and stature opened the hearts of millions and transformed America's perception of itself. As the first Black man to win the Academy Award for Best Actor, Poitier's trailblazing extended far beyond his background or profession, leaving a lasting legacy that influences every aspect of society today. The author and Jill express their love and prayers to Poitier's wife, Joanna, his daughters, and his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and offer blessings to Sidney Poitier.
