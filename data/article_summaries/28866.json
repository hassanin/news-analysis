The article highlights widespread support for Gina Haspel as the right choice to lead the CIA. 72 former CIA officers have endorsed her, and many of her current and former colleagues have also expressed their support. Senator Tom Cotton praises her professionalism, work ethic, and character, and emphasizes that she has dedicated her life to defending the country. Haspel's qualifications are also praised, with her experience in various agency disciplines, including counterterrorism and offensive intelligence operations. It is noted that she is breaking glass ceilings as a nominee who comes from the ranks of the CIA rather than a political background. The article argues that Haspel is the type of leader the CIA needs, and her confirmation would send a positive message to the intelligence community. Despite widespread agreement on her qualifications, Senate Democrats are still raising concerns based on a small period in her career.
