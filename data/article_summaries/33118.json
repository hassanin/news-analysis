President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Louisiana due to the impact of Hurricane Laura from August 22 to August 27, 2020. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The parishes of Allen, Beauregard, Calcasieu, Cameron, and Jefferson Davis are eligible for assistance, which includes grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other recovery programs for individuals and business owners. Federal funding is also available for debris removal, emergency protective measures, and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. John E. Long has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing, and additional parishes and forms of assistance may be designated once assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated parishes can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will be available from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week.
