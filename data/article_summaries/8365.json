On September 24, 2021, the President signed two laws. The first law, S. 272, called the "Congressional Budget Justification Transparency Act of 2021," requires that agency budget justification materials be made publicly available online. The second law, S. 325, extends the deadline for the Alyce Spotted Bear and Walter Soboleff Commission on Native Children to submit its report to the President and Congress by two years. The President expressed gratitude to the senators and representatives who showed leadership in passing these laws. Senators Peters, Portman, Carper, Cornyn, and Ernst, as well as Representatives Quigley, Comer, Holmes Norton, Fitzpatrick, Cooper, Khanna, Axne, and Cline were specifically mentioned for their leadership on the Congressional Budget Justification Transparency Act of 2021. Senators Murkowski, Schatz, Sullivan, and Tester, and Representatives Young, Case, and Kahele were specifically mentioned for their leadership on extending the deadline for the Alyce Spotted Bear and Walter Soboleff Commission on Native Children.
