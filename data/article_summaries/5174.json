Governor Kim Reynolds of Iowa has signed an extreme abortion ban into law, which has drawn criticism for taking away a woman's right to choose. This law is part of a trend among Republican elected officials following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The new law in Iowa will penalize healthcare providers and potentially lead to delays and denials of health and life-saving care. In contrast, President Biden and Vice President Harris support personal healthcare decisions being made between a woman and her doctor, and they will continue to push for Congress to codify the protections of Roe v. Wade into federal law. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to defending access to reproductive healthcare and opposing any attempts to pass a national abortion ban.
