This article discusses the President's plan to raise the minimum wage in order to reward work and strengthen the middle class. The President believes that no one who works full-time should have to live in poverty. Currently, a full-time minimum wage worker makes $14,500 a year, which is not enough for many families to make ends meet. The President is calling on Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $9 by the end of 2015 and index it to inflation thereafter. This would directly boost wages for 15 million workers and reduce poverty and inequality. Raising the minimum wage has been shown to increase earnings and reduce poverty without jeopardizing employment. It would also help parents make ends meet, as around 60% of workers benefiting from a higher minimum wage are women. Additionally, raising the minimum wage would benefit over 15 million workers and help more families achieve the American Dream. The proposal also includes raising the minimum wage for tipped workers and indexing it to inflation to ensure that lower-income workers can keep up with expenses. Leading economists support a higher minimum wage, stating that it would help the economy by increasing demand and job growth. Multiple economic studies have shown that increasing the minimum wage does not have a negative effect on employment and may even improve turnover and productivity. Businesses like Costco, Wal-Mart, and Stride Rite have supported past increases to the minimum wage because it helps build a strong workforce and profitability in the long run. Raising the minimum wage mostly benefits adults, especially working women. The average worker who would benefit from a rise in the minimum wage brought home 46% of their household's total wage and salary income in 2011. The extra income from raising the minimum wage would help families cover essential expenses such as groceries, utilities, gasoline, and housing.
