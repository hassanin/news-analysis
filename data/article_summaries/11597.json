The White House Council of Economic Advisers has released a report on women's participation in education and the workforce, highlighting economic trends facing working families and how the administration's policies can help. The President will visit Rhode Island College to discuss the economy's progress and his vision for expanding opportunities for women and working families. The latest GDP report shows that the US economy is heading in the right direction, but there is still more work to be done. The President has been committed to helping women succeed and has implemented policies such as raising the minimum wage, ensuring equal pay, and increasing access to childcare and paid family leave. He has also convened the White House Summit on Working Families to find solutions that benefit everyone. However, Republican lawmakers have blocked many of these initiatives. During his visit to Rhode Island, the President will discuss how these policies can help working families and grow the economy.
