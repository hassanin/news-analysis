The Biden-Harris Administration is implementing new programs to lower electricity costs for low-income families and increase access to affordable clean energy. They are announcing six actions to achieve this goal, including providing national guidance that excludes community-net-metering credits from household income and utility allowance calculations. This will prevent an increase in housing costs for residents participating in HUD Multifamily, Public Housing, and Housing Choice Voucher rental assistance programs. These initiatives are supported by funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which aims to create good-paying jobs in the clean energy sector. The administration is also focused on addressing the disproportionate energy costs faced by low-income households, with the average low-income household spending almost 9% of their income on energy. These efforts align with the President's Justice40 Initiative, which aims to deliver at least 40% of the benefits from federal climate and clean energy investments to disadvantaged communities.
