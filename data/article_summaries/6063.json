President Joseph R. Biden Jr. issued a proclamation recognizing May 2023 as Older Americans Month, honoring senior citizens for their hard work, devotion to family, and commitment to community. The proclamation acknowledges the progress made in improving the lives of seniors, such as Medicare and Social Security, but highlights the need for further action to ensure dignity and financial security for older Americans. President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which caps the cost of insulin and out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries. He also issued an Executive Order making hearing aids available over the counter without a prescription. The President emphasizes the importance of defending Social Security and Medicare and extends the life of the Medicare Trust Fund in his budget. He calls on Congress to expand access to high-quality care, support caregivers and home care workers, and improve nutrition services for seniors. The President also emphasizes the need to improve the quality and safety of nursing homes and continue the fight against cancer and other deadly diseases. The proclamation concludes by urging all Americans to celebrate older adults, support their independence, and recognize their value to the nation.
