This article discusses an executive order issued by President Donald Trump on July 11, 2019, regarding the inclusion of a citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census. The Supreme Court had previously ruled that the Department of Commerce could lawfully include a citizenship question on the census, but the explanation provided by the Department was deemed insufficient. As a result, it became impractical to include the question on the census due to logistical and timing issues. The executive order directs all executive departments and agencies to provide the Department of Commerce with maximum assistance in determining the number of citizens and non-citizens in the country through other means, such as accessing administrative records. The order also establishes an interagency working group to improve access to administrative records and considers mechanisms to expand the collection of citizenship data in the future. The article highlights the importance of accurate citizenship data for understanding the effects of immigration on the country, evaluating policy proposals, implementing programs, and generating a more reliable count of the unauthorized alien population. The order emphasizes that the data obtained will be used solely for producing statistics and subject to confidentiality protections, and will not be used for immigration enforcement actions. The policy of the United States is to develop complete and accurate data on the number of citizens, non-citizens, and illegal aliens in the country. The order concludes by stating that it does not impair existing authorities or create any enforceable rights or benefits.
