In his weekly message, President Obama discusses the progress made in Elkhart, Indiana, a city severely affected by the economic crisis. The unemployment rate in Elkhart has dropped from nearly 20% to around 4% over the past seven years. More families are financially stable, more people have health insurance, and more high school students are graduating. The President attributes this progress to the sacrifices of American workers and smart decisions made early in his presidency, such as rescuing the auto industry, helping families refinance their homes, and investing in job training, high-tech manufacturing, clean energy, and infrastructure. He emphasizes the need to continue working together towards economic goals and reject policies that protect powerful interests over Americans. The President believes that the future will be brighter if we continue this progress in the months and years to come.
