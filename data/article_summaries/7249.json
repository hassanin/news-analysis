The article discusses President Biden's modern American industrial strategy, which aims to address market failures and build a clean energy economy. It emphasizes the need for large-scale adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) to achieve the goal of net zero emissions by 2050. The U.S. consumer market for EVs is growing rapidly, with EV and hybrid sales accounting for 18 percent of light-duty vehicle sales in the third quarter of 2023. To support this growing demand, President Biden has set ambitious goals for the EV transition and has worked with Congress to lower the price of EVs and incentivize American EV and battery manufacturing.

While overall consumer satisfaction with EVs is high, the lack of public charging availability remains a barrier to adoption. Concerns about charging infrastructure, range anxiety, and charging time deter people from considering EVs for their next vehicle purchase. Investing in an extensive EV charging network is a cost-effective way to overcome these market failures and increase EV adoption. President Biden has allocated $7.5 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to build a national network of EV chargers.

The article highlights that the current charging network faces a problem of incompatibility, with multiple types of chargers and plugs in use. To tackle this issue, the Biden-Harris Administration has established minimum standards for EV chargers funded through federal programs, requiring them to support widely-used charging systems. The administration also prioritizes transparency in charging pricing and reliability of chargers. The Infrastructure Talent Pipeline Challenge has trained thousands of individuals to install EV chargers across the country, creating jobs for American workers.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides a down payment on establishing a nationwide EV charging network, with a cumulative investment of $31 to $55 billion estimated to meet anticipated charging needs by 2030. The law incentivizes private investment and requires charging infrastructure to be manufactured in America. The article notes the significant growth in U.S.-based production of fast chargers since President Biden took office, with more than 40 facilities now capable of producing over a million charging stations annually.

The investments in publicly accessible EV chargers are crucial for accelerating consumer EV adoption and helping the United States meet its climate goals. These investments are complemented by other measures, such as establishing clean power grids and generating more electricity from clean sources. The Inflation Reduction Act provides tax incentives to lower the cost of purchasing an EV and facilitate the installation of personal EV chargers. Overall, the article presents the President's economic strategy as a case study of making smart investments, attracting private sector investment, supporting high-quality jobs, and ensuring fair and competitive markets.
