The Biden administration is focused on lowering child care costs for hard-working families. President Biden signed executive actions to make care more affordable and accessible, and Vice President Harris is announcing new steps to strengthen the Child Care & Development Block Grant (CCDBG) program. The proposed rule would cap child care copayments at no more than 7% of a family's income, reducing financial strain for families. It also encourages states to waive copayments for families at or below 150% of the federal poverty level. The rule would stabilize operations for child care providers by ensuring they are paid prospectively and based on program enrollment. Additionally, the rule encourages states to streamline eligibility and enrollment processes, making it easier for families to access child care assistance. These changes aim to lower child care costs for families and improve the financial stability of child care providers.
