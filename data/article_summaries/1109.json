On Religious Freedom Day, President Joe Biden reflects on the importance of the right to practice, pray, and preach one's faith peacefully and openly. He highlights the diversity of religions practiced in the United States and the need to protect religious freedom, as enshrined in the Constitution. The President acknowledges the rising tide of antisemitism and attacks against religious groups in the country and worldwide. He emphasizes the government's efforts to combat hate and protect places of worship through the establishment of committees, increased funding for security, and the development of national strategies to fight antisemitism and other forms of bias. The administration is also collaborating with faith and community leaders on various projects, such as disaster recovery, vaccine distribution, and refugee resettlement. The United States is actively speaking out against religious persecution globally, providing financial support, appointing ambassadors for religious freedom and antisemitism, and coordinating with international partners. President Biden shares that faith has been a source of strength for him and calls for a collective commitment to ending hate and ensuring equal dignity and respect for people of all religions or no religion. In recognition of Religious Freedom Day, President Biden proclaims January 16, 2023, as a day to reaffirm these principles.
