Karen Pence, the Second Lady, recently participated in a children's music therapy group session at Children's Medical Center Dallas. The session included using instruments to express emotions, introducing themselves through a song, and writing their own song lyrics. The music therapy program has been in existence for 20 years and works with various populations, including newborns, dialysis patients, and inpatient clients. Pence received a piece of artwork from the children and gave them coloring books featuring her pets. She also spoke with the music therapists and expressed her support for art therapy. Pence aims to use her platform to raise awareness about art therapy and will share stories about her visits across the United States and around the world.
