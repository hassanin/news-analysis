The United States has allocated $144 million in new humanitarian aid to assist those affected by the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. This brings the total U.S. humanitarian aid in Afghanistan and for Afghan refugees in the region to approximately $474 million in 2021, which is the largest amount of assistance provided by any nation. The aid will be channeled through independent humanitarian organizations that directly support over 18.4 million vulnerable Afghans in the region, including Afghan refugees in neighboring countries. These organizations offer critical assistance such as protection, shelter, livelihood support, healthcare, winterization aid, emergency food supplies, water, sanitation, and hygiene services. The humanitarian needs in Afghanistan have been intensified by healthcare shortages, drought, malnutrition, and the upcoming winter season.
