President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of New York and ordered federal assistance to supplement state and local recovery efforts following a severe winter storm and snowstorm in March 2017. Federal funding will be available to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The affected counties include Albany, Broome, Chenango, Clinton, Columbia, Cortland, Delaware, Dutchess, Essex, Franklin, Fulton, Greene, Hamilton, Herkimer, Madison, Montgomery, Oneida, Orleans, Otsego, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, Suffolk, Sullivan, Tioga, Tompkins, and Ulster. The funding will also cover snow assistance for a continuous 48-hour period and hazard mitigation measures statewide. Seamus K. Leary has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas, and additional designations may be made if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments.
