The Obama Administration and the state of California are partnering to drive renewable energy and energy efficiency in multifamily housing. The goal is to install 100 megawatts of renewable energy across federally subsidized housing by 2020. Improving the energy efficiency of multifamily buildings nationwide by 20% would save nearly $7 billion in energy costs each year and cut 350 million tons of carbon pollution in a decade. The actions announced include unlocking financing for energy efficiency and solar energy improvements in multifamily housing, driving on-bill repayment for affordable multifamily properties, engaging philanthropy and the financial sector to support renewable energy in affordable housing, empowering communities to deploy solar, and announcing new commitments to advance energy efficiency investments in multifamily housing. The administration is also calling on Section 202 Project Rental Assistance Contract (PRAC) properties to take advantage of the PRAC Shared Savings incentive to make energy and water improvements. Additionally, efforts are being made to make energy data more accessible for multifamily housing owners to help them reduce energy consumption. These actions build on the progress made in deploying renewable energy and promoting energy efficiency.
