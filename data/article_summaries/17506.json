President Barack Obama issued a proclamation for Memorial Day in 2014, recognizing and honoring the sacrifices made by men and women who have served in the military. He called on the nation to remember and pray for fallen troops, and to support their families. The proclamation also designated Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace, and asked Americans to observe a National Moment of Remembrance at 3:00 p.m. local time. The President requested that flags be flown at half-staff until noon on Memorial Day, and encouraged individuals to display the flag at half-staff in the morning.
