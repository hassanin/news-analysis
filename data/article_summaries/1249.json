During Minority Enterprise Development Week, President Biden honors minority-owned businesses and commits to providing them with the resources they need to succeed. Minority enterprises play a crucial role in the economy, generating nearly $2 trillion in revenue each year. However, they often face barriers such as limited access to capital and government contracts. To address these challenges, the Biden Administration has taken steps to advance racial equity and support underserved communities. For example, they have increased the share of federal contracts going to small disadvantaged businesses and provided billions of dollars in loans to Black, Latino, and Asian American-owned small businesses. Additionally, investments have been made to support minority entrepreneurs through Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions. The American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law have also provided funding and support for small businesses. President Biden emphasizes the importance of promoting economic equality and ensuring that every American has the opportunity to build a successful business. As a result, he proclaims October 22 through October 28, 2023, as Minority Enterprise Development Week and calls upon the people of the United States to celebrate the achievements and contributions of minority business owners and enterprises.
