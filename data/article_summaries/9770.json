In this press gaggle aboard Air Force One, Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton discusses BP's efforts to contain the leaking oil in the Gulf of Mexico. He mentions that BP has outlined a plan to contain more than 50,000 barrels of oil per day by the end of June, two weeks earlier than originally suggested. The plan also includes methods to provide greater redundancy beyond June to account for bad weather or unforeseen circumstances. Burton emphasizes that the administration will continue to hold BP accountable and bring all possible resources and innovations to bear. He also provides a schedule of the President's activities during the visit to the Gulf region. Additionally, Admiral Allen answers questions about BP's change in plans and their ability to meet the new goals. He explains that the plan has evolved as flow-rate estimates have been refined and that BP has been responsive to feedback from the administration. Allen discusses the different methods BP is implementing to increase production capacity and mentions that the ultimate flow rate is still being determined. The press also asks questions about the escrow account for claims and the upcoming Oval Office address by the President.
