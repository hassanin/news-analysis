The White House Press Secretary released a statement praising the approval of the DREAM Act in the House of Representatives. They agree with the Senate's decision to table the version under consideration in favor of taking up the version approved in the House. Eight Republicans voted with Democrats to approve the bill in the House. The Press Secretary believes the DREAM Act is the right thing to do for the nation, the economy, and security, and it also reduces the deficit. The President is looking forward to the Senate approving the bill so that he can sign it into law.
