The President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, has issued a notice to continue the national emergency with respect to the Central African Republic. This national emergency was initially declared on May 12, 2014, due to the breakdown of law and order, sectarian tension, widespread violence and atrocities, and the use of child soldiers in the Central African Republic. The situation in the country continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. As a result, the national emergency will remain in effect beyond May 12, 2017, for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
