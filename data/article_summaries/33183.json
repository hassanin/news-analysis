The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released its monthly Employment Situation Report, which shows robust employment growth in September. The unemployment rate fell to 3.5 percent, the lowest it has been since May 1969. The lowest unemployment rates on record were also matched or set in September 2019 for African Americans, Hispanics, and people with disabilities. The unemployment rate for those without a high school diploma fell to 4.8 percent, the lowest rate since 1992. The U-6 unemployment rate, which is a broader measure of underutilization in the labor market, fell to its lowest point since 2000. The labor force participation rate remained constant at 63.2 percent and the employment-population ratio increased to 61.0 percent. The BLS's establishment survey shows that nonfarm payroll employment increased by 136,000 jobs in September. Overall, the September employment data show that the American labor market remains historically strong.
