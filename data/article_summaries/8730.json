The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of the Interior (DOI), the Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have announced a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to collaborate on protecting communities from the impacts of wildfire smoke and reducing the risk of severe fires. The agencies have also released a joint plan outlining their priorities for the next two years. The MOU focuses on advancing public health preparedness, minimizing smoke impacts, and accommodating greater use of prescribed fire. The agencies commit to coordinating policies, communications, and programs related to prescribed fire, forest restoration, and community protection. The joint workplan aligns with the recent Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission Report to Congress, which emphasizes the need for coordination and collaboration among agencies. The announcement complements President Biden's investments in increasing the resilience of lands facing wildfire threats and supporting federal wildland firefighters.
