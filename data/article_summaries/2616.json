The United States strongly condemns Russia's fraudulent attempt to annex Ukrainian territory. These actions violate international law and demonstrate Russia's disregard for peaceful nations. The United States pledges to uphold Ukraine's recognized borders and will support their efforts to regain control of their territory through military and diplomatic means. The United States, along with its allies and partners, will impose new sanctions on individuals and entities that support illegal attempts to change the status of Ukrainian territory. The international community will be rallied to denounce these moves and hold Russia accountable. The United States will continue to provide Ukraine with the necessary equipment to defend itself, despite Russia's brazen attempt to redraw borders. Additionally, the United States looks forward to signing legislation to provide an additional $12 billion in support to Ukraine. The international community is urged to reject Russia's illegal annexation attempts and stand with Ukraine.
