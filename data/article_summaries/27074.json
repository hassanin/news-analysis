On March 12, 2018, President Donald Trump issued an executive order regarding the proposed takeover of Qualcomm Incorporated by Broadcom Limited. The order states that there is credible evidence that Broadcom, along with its partners, subsidiaries, or affiliates, might take actions that threaten to impair the national security of the United States. The order prohibits the proposed takeover of Qualcomm by Broadcom and any substantially equivalent merger, acquisition, or takeover. It also disqualifies 15 individuals listed as potential candidates for election as directors of Qualcomm. The order requires Qualcomm to hold its annual stockholder meeting within 10 days of providing notice to stockholders. The order further mandates that the Purchaser and Qualcomm immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover and certify the termination to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The order also prohibits any transaction or device employed to avoid or circumvent the order. The Attorney General is authorized to enforce the order, and the President reserves the authority to issue further orders to protect national security. The order was published in the Federal Register and a copy was transmitted to Qualcomm and Broadcom.
