President Barack Obama announced that he will posthumously award Jan Karski with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. Karski was a former officer in the Polish Underground during World War II and one of the first to provide eye-witness accounts of the Holocaust. He witnessed Jews being transported on cattle cars and saw the killings firsthand. Karski met with President Roosevelt to share his accounts and later published his experiences in a book called "Story of a Secret State." He became a U.S. citizen in 1954 and passed away in 2000. The award will be presented at a White House ceremony later in the spring.
