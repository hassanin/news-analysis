The White House has announced that President Obama has submitted the Protocols to the African Nuclear Weapon Free Zone Treaty and the South Pacific Nuclear Weapon Free Zone Treaty to the U.S. Senate for ratification. This move aligns with the President's commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and a world without nuclear weapons. These regional nuclear weapon free zone agreements reinforce the commitment of nations to not pursue nuclear weapons and the non-use of nuclear weapons for the past 65 years. Once ratified, the protocols will extend the United States' policy of not using or threatening to use nuclear weapons against regional zone parties that are members of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and are in compliance with their non-proliferation obligations. The United States also plans to engage with parties to two other regional agreements in Southeast Asia and Central Asia to sign protocols to those treaties as well.
