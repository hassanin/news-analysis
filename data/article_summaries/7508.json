The United States has welcomed the two-week extension of the ceasefire in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This extension shows the commitment of the parties involved in the conflict, as well as neighboring countries, to reducing tensions. It follows a previous 72-hour ceasefire brokered by the United States and recent engagement by Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines with President Felix Tshisekedi of DRC and President Paul Kagame of Rwanda. The extension commits the parties to advancing the implementation of confidence-building measures, such as enforcing the DRC Government's directive against supporting rebel groups and withdrawing forces from certain areas. The Governments of DRC and Rwanda also emphasize the importance of deploying inter-positional forces to facilitate the safe return of displaced civilians. The United States commends the parties involved and regional governments for their support and will continue to monitor compliance with the ceasefire. The United States also supports the resumption of processes aimed at addressing the factors perpetuating the conflict.
