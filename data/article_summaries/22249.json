President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Kansas due to flooding that occurred between June 1 and August 1, 2011. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The counties of Atchison, Doniphan, Leavenworth, and Wyandotte are eligible for federal funding for emergency work, facility repair or replacement, and hazard mitigation measures. Bradley Harris has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and deemed necessary based on further damage assessments. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
