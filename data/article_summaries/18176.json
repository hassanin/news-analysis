The United States has committed to taking several actions to increase transparency of company ownership and control. These actions include updating the national risk assessment to address abuse of legal entities, advocating for comprehensive legislation to require identification and verification of beneficial ownership information, regulating company formation agents to include anti-money laundering obligations, ensuring accessibility of beneficial ownership information to law enforcement authorities, mandating entities to update information on beneficial owners, providing exemptions for certain entities, and imposing penalties for providing false information. The United States is also working on developing customer due diligence standards for financial institutions and assessing the effectiveness of existing international cooperation on beneficial ownership.
