The Biden-Harris administration is taking key steps to combat the monkeypox outbreak in the United States. The White House National Response Coordinator for monkeypox, Bob Fenton, announced that the administration is implementing a whole-of-government approach to scale up and accelerate the response. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has made over 1.1 million vaccine doses available across the country, with more than 620,000 doses already delivered. Additionally, HHS has deployed over 15,000 courses of the TPOXX treatment and increased the country's testing capacity to 80,000 tests per week. HHS Secretary Becerra declared a public health emergency last week, and today he exercised his authority under Section 564 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to allow the FDA to take further measures to increase the availability of vaccines. The FDA has issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Jynneos vaccine, allowing healthcare providers to use an alternative dosing regimen that can increase the total number of doses available by up to fivefold. The EUA also permits the use of the vaccine in individuals younger than 18 years old who are at high risk of monkeypox infection. The FDA and CDC will continue to monitor the vaccine's effectiveness through ongoing studies and data collection. The CDC will provide resources and education to healthcare providers and the community to support the transition to the intradermal administration of the vaccine. The administration is working to ensure that there is a sufficient supply of vaccines to meet demand and is continuing to accelerate vaccine production and distribution.
