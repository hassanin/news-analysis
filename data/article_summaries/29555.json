The President has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13664, with respect to South Sudan, is to continue beyond April 3, 2017. The situation in South Sudan continues to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States due to activities such as violence, atrocities, human rights abuses, recruitment and use of child soldiers, attacks on peacekeepers and humanitarian workers, and obstruction of humanitarian operations.
