The article discusses the President's plan to encourage private investment in America's infrastructure. The plan includes partnering with the private sector to create jobs and invest in infrastructure projects, giving state and local governments flexible tools to invest in infrastructure, and building a transportation network that supports businesses and workers. The President calls for the establishment of a National Infrastructure Bank to leverage private and public capital for infrastructure projects. The plan also includes the America Fast Forward Bonds program, which broadens the use of qualified private activity bonds to finance infrastructure projects.
