In this article, President Donald Trump proclaims the week of October 13-19, 2019, as National School Lunch Week. He highlights the importance of school lunch programs in providing nutritious meals to children, which helps them learn and succeed academically. The National School Lunch Program, established in 1946, serves low-cost or free lunches to over 29 million children in public and residential child-care institutions across the country. The program has seen significant growth over the years, with school cafeterias now serving nearly 5 billion lunches annually. The success of this program is attributed to the collaboration between the federal, state, and local governments, as well as the efforts of food service professionals, school administrators, community members, and parents. The article also mentions the role of farmers, ranchers, and producers in ensuring that children have access to healthy, domestically sourced foods. The Trump administration has awarded a record high of over $9 million in Farm to School Program grants, benefiting more than 3.2 million children in 42 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The proclamation recognizes the importance of the National School Lunch Program and calls upon all Americans to support and promote the health and well-being of the nation's children.
