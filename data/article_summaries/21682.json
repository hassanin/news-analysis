This press gaggle took place aboard Air Force One en route to Boston, Massachusetts. Josh Earnest, the Principal Deputy Press Secretary, provided several updates. Firstly, President Obama signed a disaster declaration for the state of Massachusetts, making additional federal resources available to respond to the bombings in Boston. Secondly, the President received a briefing on the investigation into the bombings from his Homeland Security Advisor, Lisa Monaco. Thirdly, President Obama will have the opportunity to meet with the families of those affected by the bombings and talk to first responders while in Boston. The press also asked questions about the situation in West, Texas, gun control, North Korea, Iran, and any progress in the Boston bombing investigation, but Earnest did not provide any specific details in response to those questions.
