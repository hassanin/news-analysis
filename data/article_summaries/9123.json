The President of the United States, Joseph R. Biden Jr., has issued a notice to extend the national emergency with respect to South Sudan. The national emergency was initially declared on April 3, 2014, due to the unusual and extraordinary threat posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States by the situation in and in relation to South Sudan. This situation has been characterized by activities such as violence, atrocities, human rights abuses, recruitment and use of child soldiers, attacks on peacekeepers, and obstruction of humanitarian operations. The extension of the national emergency is deemed necessary beyond April 3, 2021, as the situation in and in relation to South Sudan continues to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. This extension is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be in effect for one year. The notice has been published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
