The article is a message from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating that the national emergency with respect to Sudan will continue beyond November 3, 2011. The actions and policies of the Sudanese government that led to the declaration of the national emergency in 1997 have not been resolved and continue to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Barack Obama has determined it necessary to maintain the sanctions against Sudan in response to this threat.
