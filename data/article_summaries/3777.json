Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and US President Joe Biden have announced a new trilateral defense partnership called AUKUS (Australia, United Kingdom, United States). The partnership aims to enhance security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region and strengthen the existing network of partnerships in the area. The first major initiative of AUKUS will be to provide Australia with a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines, which will be built in Adelaide, Australia, in collaboration with the UK and the US. It is emphasized that these submarines will be powered by nuclear reactors, not armed with nuclear weapons. The leaders reaffirmed their commitment to upholding freedom, democracy, and the rule of law, and expressed the importance of investing in alliances and modern capabilities to address evolving threats. The partnership will also focus on critical technologies such as cyber, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, and undersea domains. The leaders emphasized the importance of collaboration with other key countries, including France, which already plays a significant role in the Indo-Pacific. The program will undergo an 18-month consultation period to determine all aspects, including workforce, training, production timelines, and nonproliferation measures. The leaders expressed their gratitude for the partnership and highlighted the enduring strength of the shared values among the three nations.
