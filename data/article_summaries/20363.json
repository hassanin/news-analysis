The White House has issued a presidential proclamation declaring May 23-29 as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. The proclamation urges individuals, families, communities, and businesses to take time to plan for the upcoming hurricane season. It emphasizes the importance of knowledge and preparation in ensuring emergency readiness and responsiveness. The National Hurricane Center and the Federal Emergency Management Agency recommend developing a family disaster plan, maintaining an emergency supply kit, securing homes and belongings, and learning evacuation routes. The proclamation also highlights the administration's focus on preparedness and response before, during, and after hurricanes, including improving accountability and coordination between all levels of government and modernizing emergency communications. The National Hurricane Center is working to provide citizens with more notice before impending storms. The proclamation calls upon all Americans, especially those in hurricane-prone areas, to learn more about protecting themselves against hurricanes and to work together to respond to them.
