This article discusses the termination of Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for Liberians in the United States. Since 1991, Liberian nationals and persons without nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia have been eligible for either Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or DED, allowing them to stay in the US. However, President Trump has determined that conditions in Liberia have improved and no longer warrant an extension of DED. Instead, a 12-month wind-down period will be provided to allow for an orderly transition for Liberian DED beneficiaries. During this period, current Liberian DED beneficiaries who satisfy certain criteria may remain in the US and continue to work. The wind-down period and employment authorization will not apply to certain categories of individuals.
