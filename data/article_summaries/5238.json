The author strongly supports California's Agricultural Labor Relations Voting Choice Act (AB 2183), which aims to provide agricultural workers with the opportunity to organize and collectively bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions. The author highlights the tireless efforts and personal risks that farmworkers have endured during the pandemic to ensure food supply. They believe that these workers deserve an easier path to make a free and fair choice to organize a union, considering California's status as the state with the largest population of farmworkers. The author expresses gratitude to California's elected officials and union leaders for their leadership in this area.

The author emphasizes the importance of removing barriers to workers organizing, as it is ultimately the workers' choice whether to form a union. They highlight the transformative impact of unions on workers' lives, including higher wages, better benefits (such as health insurance and paid leave), protection against discrimination and harassment, and a safer workplace. The author asserts that unions have played a crucial role in building the middle class and giving workers a voice. They argue that organizing or joining a union is a demonstration of democracy in action, particularly for Black and Brown workers whose voices have historically been silenced by race-based laws and policies. The author concludes by stating that it is long overdue to ensure that farmworkers and other essential workers have the same right to join a union as other Americans.
