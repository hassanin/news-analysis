Vice President Biden has announced the recipients of $450 million in job-driven training grants. The grants will go to nearly 270 community colleges across the country, partnering with over 400 employers. The funding is part of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training (TAACCCT) competitive grant program, which aims to train workers with the skills they need for in-demand jobs in industries like information technology, health care, energy, and advanced manufacturing. The grants will also help low-wage workers access internships, apprenticeships, and job-relevant basic skills education and training. Additionally, 25 grantees are developing new training programs for information technology and cybersecurity jobs. The President's 2015 budget proposes a $6 billion Community College Job-Driven Training Fund to further invest in these types of partnerships.
