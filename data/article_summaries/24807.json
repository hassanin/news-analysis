The United States strongly condemns the aerial bombardment by the Sudan Armed Forces of the town of Yida in South Sudan. Yida is home to over 20,000 refugees who have fled the conflict in Southern Kordofan. The bombing of civilians and humanitarian workers is unacceptable, and those responsible must be held accountable. This attack, along with other bombings near the international border, increases the risk of direct confrontation between Sudan and South Sudan. The United States calls for an immediate halt to aerial bombardments by the Government of Sudan and urges South Sudan to exercise restraint in responding to this provocation. The US also calls for negotiations to resume between the Sudanese government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North to address political and security arrangements in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile.
