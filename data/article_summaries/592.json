President Biden held a press conference in the Roosevelt Room, where he thanked his team for averting a rail disaster and passing a bill to end a rail dispute. He emphasized the importance of the rail system in delivering essential goods and preventing an economic catastrophe. The bill provides workers with a 24 percent wage increase, improved working conditions, and healthcare benefits. However, the bill does not include paid sick leave, which the President is committed to fighting for. He expressed gratitude to Congress for acting quickly and acknowledged the tough vote for members of both parties. The President also highlighted the positive economic indicators, such as falling gas prices and job growth. He mentioned that the economy added 263,000 jobs in November and has created a total of 10.5 million jobs since he took office. The unemployment rate remains low at 3.7 percent, and wages for working families have increased faster than inflation. President Biden concluded by thanking Congress for averting the rail strike and emphasized his commitment to building the economy from the bottom up. He signed the bill and expressed his appreciation for the team's efforts. When asked about going to Georgia to help Senator Warnock, the President mentioned that he would be attending a fundraiser in Boston for the Senate candidate. He also stated that rail workers can expect sick days as soon as he can convince Republicans to support it.
