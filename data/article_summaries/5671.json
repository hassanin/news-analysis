The United States welcomes the resumption of direct flights between Sana'a, Yemen and Amman, Jordan. These are the first commercial flights from Sana'a since 2016, and they are seen as a positive outcome of the UN-brokered truce that has been in effect for almost six weeks. This period is considered the calmest in Yemen since the war began, and the flights are seen as a significant step in improving the lives and opportunities for the Yemeni people. The United States expresses gratitude to Saudi Arabia for its leadership in overcoming obstacles to the resumption of these flights, as well as to the governments of Jordan and Yemen for their efforts in finalizing the arrangements. The United States, led by Special Envoy Tim Lenderking, supports ongoing diplomatic engagement between the parties and UN Special Envoy Hans Grundberg's efforts to improve freedom of movement within Yemen, including the opening of roads in Taiz and other areas. The United States remains committed to supporting Yemen's sovereignty, stability, security, and prosperity through an inclusive, UN-led political process to help the Yemeni people determine their country's future.
