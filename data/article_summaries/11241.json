The Obama administration set the goal of ending veteran homelessness by the end of 2015, and First Lady Michelle Obama announced the commitment of 77 mayors, 4 governors, and 4 county officials to meet that goal. The challenge involves marshaling federal, local, and non-profit efforts to provide permanent housing for veterans and connect them to necessary support services. The article also highlights the resources and programs provided by the federal government to strengthen homeless assistance programs and outlines various strategies to achieve the goal of ending veteran homelessness. The success of this initiative is demonstrated by cities like Salt Lake City and Phoenix, where mayors have announced major milestones in ending chronic homelessness among veterans.
