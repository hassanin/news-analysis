In a briefing call, a senior administration official discusses the G7 summit and upcoming NATO meeting. The G7 leaders have made commitments to address global food security, with the United States contributing $2.76 billion in funding. The official highlights the impact of Putin's actions on food security, straining agricultural production and using food as a weapon of war. Estimates suggest that up to 40 million people could be pushed into poverty as a result. The G7 leaders also discuss China and its non-market practices, committing to develop a coordinated approach to address them. They also address China's role in leaving low- and middle-income countries in debt traps and commit to tackling forced labor in global supply chains, including state-sponsored forced labor in Xinjiang. The official mentions that the G7's focus on the Indo-Pacific is linked to the transatlantic alliance and highlights President Biden's upcoming trilateral meeting with the leaders of South Korea and Japan to discuss issues related to North Korea. The official indicates that the NATO trip will provide more information on these matters. During the Q&A session, the official provides details on the funding for food security, the importance of getting Ukraine's grain to global markets, and the focus on oil price caps. They also mention that the G7 communiqu√© will have similar language on the Indo-Pacific and the Taiwan Strait as last year, but with material steps forward in addressing China's economic practices and debt sustainability.
