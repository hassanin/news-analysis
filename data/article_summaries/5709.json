This declaration authorizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate disaster relief efforts and provide assistance to save lives, protect property, and ensure public health and safety. FEMA is authorized to mobilize equipment and resources to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. Emergency protective measures will be provided at 75 percent federal funding. Andrew F.
