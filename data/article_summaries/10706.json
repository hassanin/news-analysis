The White House has announced a National Tourism and Travel Strategy aimed at attracting and welcoming 100 million international visitors to the United States annually by 2021. The strategy sets out concrete steps in five key areas to achieve this goal, with the aim of increasing American jobs and boosting economic growth. The U.S. tourism and travel industry is a significant contributor to the country's GDP, exports, and employment. Efforts to make America the top tourist destination in the world offer an opportunity to create jobs and strengthen the economy. In 2011, the industry generated $1.2 trillion in revenue and supported 7.6 million jobs. The strategy reflects input from local government and business leaders, as well as ongoing initiatives throughout the federal government.
