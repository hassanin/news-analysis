The Department of Justice (DOJ) has completed a review of solitary confinement in American prisons and has developed strategies to reduce its use. The review resulted in a report that sets out guiding principles for limiting the use of restrictive housing at the federal, state, and local level. These principles include housing inmates in the least restrictive setting necessary for safety, developing clear plans for returning inmates to less restrictive conditions, regularly reviewing an inmate's placement in restrictive housing, and training correctional staff on restrictive housing policies. The President has adopted these recommendations and directed federal agencies to review the report and develop plans to address their use of solitary confinement. The report also includes specific recommendations for the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to implement, such as ending restrictive housing for juveniles, diverting inmates with serious mental illness to alternative forms of housing, and limiting the use of punitive segregation. The BOP will also increase transparency by publishing monthly data on restrictive housing and improving tracking of restrictive housing inmates.
