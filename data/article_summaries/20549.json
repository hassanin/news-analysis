President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring September 11, 2014, as Patriot Day and National Day of Service and Remembrance. This day is dedicated to remembering the tragic events of September 11, 2001, when nearly 3,000 individuals lost their lives in a terrorist attack. The proclamation calls upon all departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the United States to display the flag at half-staff on this day. The President also invites the Governors of the United States and its Territories, as well as interested organizations and individuals, to join in this observance. The proclamation encourages people to participate in community service in honor of those lost and to observe a moment of silence at 8:46 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time, the time when the first plane struck the World Trade Center.
