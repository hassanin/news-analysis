President Barack Obama announced the creation of a White House Task Force on Middle Class Working Families, chaired by Vice President Joe Biden. The task force aims to raise the living standards of middle-class, working families in America. It is comprised of top-level administration policy makers and will conduct outreach sessions with representatives of labor, business, and advocacy communities. The task force will work with federal agencies to propose reforms, executive orders, and legislative and policy proposals that benefit working families. The goals of the task force include expanding education and training opportunities, improving work and family balance, restoring labor standards, protecting middle-class and working-family incomes, and protecting retirement security. The task force's first official meeting will focus on "Green Jobs: A Pathway to a Strong Middle Class." Transparency is a priority, and materials from meetings and reports will be made available to the public on the task force's website.
