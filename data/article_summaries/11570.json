The Strengthen Social Security Campaign, a coalition of 300 organizations representing more than 50 million Americans, released a statement in response to President Obama's deficit-reduction speech. The campaign applauded the President for stating that Social Security is not in crisis and is not a cause of the nation's deficits. They also praised his opposition to efforts to privatize or weaken the program. However, they urged the President to remove Social Security from the bipartisan budget negotiations, as past Congresses have kept it separate from deficit debates. The campaign emphasized that Social Security is essential to the economic security of millions of Americans and can pay all benefits in full for the next 25 years. They believe it should not be held hostage to a deficit-reduction deal. The campaign also urged the President to reject the Social Security proposals put forth by the co-chairs of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, as they would slash benefits, increase the retirement age, and fundamentally change the program. Instead, they suggested that the President should listen to the majority of the American people who prefer increased revenues over cutting benefits.
