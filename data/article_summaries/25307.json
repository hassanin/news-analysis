The United States has imposed sanctions on 25 individuals and entities that support Iran's ballistic missile program and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. The US believes that Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism and engages in activities that destabilize the Middle East. Despite the favorable deal given to Iran by the Obama Administration, Iran's belligerent behavior has continued. Examples include the abduction of US sailors, harassment of vessel traffic, weapons tests, and recent ballistic missile tests. The US believes that the international community has been too tolerant of Iran's actions and that strong statements from the UN are not enough. The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate Iran's provocations that threaten US interests and the days of turning a blind eye to Iran's hostile actions are over.
