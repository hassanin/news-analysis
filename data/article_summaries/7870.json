The President is pleased that the Department of Justice is appealing a judge's decision that blocks a provision of the Affordable Care Act. This provision ensures free access to preventive health care for 150 million Americans. The President views this as yet another attack on the Affordable Care Act, which has been in place for 13 years and has withstood three previous challenges before the Supreme Court. Preventive care is important as it saves lives, saves families money, and improves overall health. The ACA has provided millions of Americans with access to free screenings for cancer and heart disease. This decision puts critical care at risk. Despite opposition from special interests, the Administration will continue to fight for better and more affordable health care for hard-working families.
