President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama send their best wishes to those celebrating Passover in the United States, Israel, and around the world. They highlight the power of Passover's tradition of storytelling, where families and friends come together to share the inspirational tale of the Exodus. The journey from bondage to the Promised Land serves as a symbol of emancipation and has provided comfort to Jewish families during times of oppression. The Obamas mention that this Passover will be their last Seder in the White House, a tradition they have cherished since hosting the first-ever White House Seder in 2009. They express their intention to join millions around the world to celebrate redemption and pray for those who are still denied their freedom. The President and First Lady also describe some of the rituals of the Seder, such as dipping greens in saltwater to recall tears shed by the unjustly imprisoned and spilling wine to remember those who have suffered. They emphasize the importance of gratitude for even the smallest blessings and slowest progress. Passover is seen as an opportunity to renew belief in things unseen and to rededicate ourselves to peace and freedom for all. The Obamas conclude by sending their warm wishes for a happy Passover, or "chag sameach."
