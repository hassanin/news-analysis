President Donald Trump has signed into law the "Frederick Douglass Bicentennial Commission Act," which establishes the Frederick Douglass Bicentennial Commission. The commission will be responsible for planning and organizing activities to honor Frederick Douglass on the 200th anniversary of his birth. Frederick Douglass was a former slave who became a renowned orator and a leader in the abolitionist movement. President Trump welcomes the participation of Congress members in the commission's work but emphasizes that their role will be limited to ceremonial or advisory functions to respect the separation of powers and the Constitution's Appointments and Ineligibility Clauses. President Trump acknowledges that all Americans have much to learn from Douglass's life and writings and looks forward to celebrating his achievements with the commission.
