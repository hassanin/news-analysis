The Biden-Harris Administration has been working to establish or expand community vaccination centers across the United States. Since January 20, they have supported the establishment or expansion of 441 vaccination centers in 37 states, territories, and the District of Columbia. These centers are located in trusted community spaces such as community centers, schools, and stadiums. The goal is to administer 100 million vaccine shots in 100 days and ensure equitable distribution. The federal government has also announced 18 federally-established vaccination centers, with the capacity to administer 61,000 shots per day. These centers are strategically located in areas that aim to reach high-risk communities. The administration is prioritizing access and equity by offering extended hours, partnering with faith-based and community-based organizations for registration, and deploying mobile vaccination units. Several centers have already opened in California, Texas, and New York, with more sites set to open in Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and North Carolina in the coming weeks.
