President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran, which was declared in Executive Order 12170 on November 14, 1979, will continue beyond November 14, 2022. The President believes that our relations with Iran have not yet normalized and that the process of implementing agreements with Iran from January 19, 1981, is still ongoing. Therefore, he has determined it is necessary to extend the national emergency.
