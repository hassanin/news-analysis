President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation suspending the application of duty-free treatment for all AGOA-eligible goods in the apparel sector from Rwanda. This is in response to his determination that Rwanda is not meeting the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974. The proclamation also includes modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) to reflect changes in the national tariff schedules of parties to the United States-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement (USBFTA) and amendments to the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System. Additionally, the proclamation corrects technical errors in a previous proclamation regarding safeguard measures on certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells.
