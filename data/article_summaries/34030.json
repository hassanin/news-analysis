President Donald J. Trump will be awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Jim Ryun, a former United States Representative from Kansas and one of the most accomplished American runners in history. The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the highest civilian honor in the country and is awarded to individuals who have made significant contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, or cultural and public endeavors. Despite facing rejection from athletic teams in junior high, Ryun went on to break world records in high school and college, compete in multiple Olympic Games, and receive various awards and accolades. After his athletic career, he served as a congressman for Kansas and has since become a motivational speaker and author.
