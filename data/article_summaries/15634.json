President Barack Obama has proclaimed April as National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. The proclamation highlights the need to confront sexual violence as a deplorable crime and emphasizes the importance of supporting victims and preventing these crimes. It acknowledges that sexual assault remains pervasive and underreported in the United States, with rates particularly high among certain groups such as American Indian and Alaska Native women. The proclamation calls for improved responses from the criminal justice system, including treating victims with seriousness and respect and providing services to help them recover. The administration is committed to preventing sexual assault through various initiatives led by federal agencies, such as the Department of Justice's Sexual Assault Demonstration Initiative and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's prevention campaigns. The proclamation also emphasizes the need to address sexual violence globally, including as a tool of conflict. President Obama urges all Americans to support victims and work together to prevent sexual assault in their communities.
