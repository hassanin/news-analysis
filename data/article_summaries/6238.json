President Biden has declared a major disaster in Alabama and authorized federal assistance to support recovery efforts in areas affected by severe storms, winds, and tornadoes from March 25 to March 26, 2021. The declaration makes federal funding available to individuals in eight counties for temporary housing, home repairs, and low-cost loans to cover property losses. Hazard mitigation measures will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis statewide. Allan Jarvis has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations, with additional designations possible in the future. Affected residents and business owners can apply for assistance online or by phone. For more information, the FEMA News Desk can be contacted.
