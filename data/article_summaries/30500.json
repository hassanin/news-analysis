In this article, Ivanka Trump, advisor to the President, discusses the growing support among conservatives for a national paid family leave plan. She highlights how social conservatives view paid leave as a way to strengthen families and protect vulnerable infants and parents, while fiscal hawks recognize the benefits of increasing workforce attachment and reducing government dependence. Trump also mentions the concern over declining fertility rates and the impact on society and the economy. She mentions that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes a provision to incentivize businesses to offer paid family leave, but emphasizes that a tax credit alone is not enough.
