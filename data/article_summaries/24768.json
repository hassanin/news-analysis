The President is scheduled to deliver remarks at a groundbreaking ceremony at Compact Power, Inc., a battery plant in Holland, Michigan. This plant is one of nine new advanced battery factories that were started as a result of $2.4 billion in Recovery Act advanced battery and electric vehicle awards announced by the President last August. The project is expected to create hundreds of construction and manufacturing jobs in Holland. Once operational, the plant will produce battery cells to support 53,000 Chevy Volts per year. The Department of Energy has also released a report on the economic impact of Recovery Act investments in advanced batteries and vehicles. The report highlights how these investments are creating new jobs, constructing new plants, adding new manufacturing lines, and installing electric vehicle charging stations across the country. The President will be accompanied by Secretary of Energy Steven Chu on his trip to Michigan.
