This article is a presidential memorandum issued by President Donald J. Trump on June 13, 2017. The memorandum is titled "Presidential Determination Pursuant to Section 4533(a)(5) of the Defense Production Act of 1950." In this memorandum, President Trump determines that there are critical technology item shortfalls affecting adenovirus vaccine production capability, high strength, inherently fire and ballistic resistant, co-polymer aramid fibers industrial capability, secure hybrid composite shipping container industrial capability, and three-dimensional ultra high density microelectronics for information protection industrial capability that are critical to national defense. The President states that without his action under the Defense Production Act, the United States defense industrial base cannot reasonably be expected to adequately provide these capabilities in a timely manner. He further states that purchases, purchase commitments, or other action pursuant to section 4533 of the Act are the most cost effective, expedient, and practical alternative method for meeting the need for these capabilities. The memorandum concludes by authorizing and directing the Secretary of Defense to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
