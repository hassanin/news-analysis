The White House Press Briefing Room was held by Jen Psaki, the White House Press Secretary, and Daleep Singh, Deputy National Security Advisor. Singh provided a briefing on the sanctions announcement in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The first tranche of sanctions includes blocking Russia's Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline from becoming operational, blocking Russian financial institutions, and imposing sanctions on Russian elites. Singh emphasized the speed and coordination of the sanctions, as well as the potency of the financial sanctions. He also mentioned that additional actions could be taken if Putin escalates further. The briefing also touched on the impact of sanctions on energy prices and the possibility of a summit between President Biden and Putin. Psaki reiterated that diplomacy is still an option but emphasized the need for de-escalation. She also addressed concerns about the impact of sanctions on the American public and the administration's commitment to supporting Ukraine and its NATO allies.
