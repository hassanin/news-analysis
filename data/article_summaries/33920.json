President Trump has vetoed H.J. Res. 76, a resolution aimed at overturning a Department of Education rule that protects students and taxpayers. The resolution sought to reintroduce an Obama-era regulation that defined educational fraud broadly, potentially harming the nation's higher education system. The Department of Education's rule, on the other hand, strikes a better balance by protecting students' rights to recover from fraudulent schools while preventing frivolous lawsuits that could undermine higher education and burden taxpayers. Many leaders of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) believe that reinstating the Obama-era rule would have irreparably harmed their institutions. President Trump's veto is seen as another example of his support for HBCUs. He urges Congress to sustain his veto and stand with HBCUs and students against trial lawyers seeking to undermine the higher education system for their own financial gain.
