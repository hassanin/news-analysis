President Biden and Prime Minister Modi announced the U.S.-India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) to enhance the strategic technology partnership and defense industrial cooperation between the two countries. They emphasized that technology should be shaped by shared democratic values and respect for human rights. The inaugural meeting of iCET was led by the National Security Advisors of both countries, along with officials from various departments and agencies. The discussions focused on opportunities for cooperation in critical and emerging technologies, co-development, and coproduction. They also identified areas such as biotechnology, advanced materials, and rare earth processing technology for future cooperation. The two sides expressed commitment to resolving regulatory barriers and promoting business and talent mobility through a standing mechanism under iCET. The United States and India are launching new initiatives in areas such as innovation ecosystems, defense technology cooperation, semiconductor supply chains, space, STEM talent, and next-generation telecommunications. The next iCET meeting is scheduled to take place in New Delhi in 2023.
