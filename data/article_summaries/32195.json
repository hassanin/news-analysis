President Donald Trump has issued a Presidential Memorandum regarding the continued federal support for governors' use of the National Guard to respond to COVID-19 and facilitate economic recovery. The memorandum states that it is the policy of the United States to assist state and territorial governors in their responses to threats and hazards to the American people. It acknowledges the ongoing public health risks posed by the COVID-19 outbreak and the need for cooperation between the federal government and the states. The memorandum directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to fund 100 percent of the emergency assistance activities undertaken by the states of Alabama, Alaska, and Delaware using their National Guard forces. It also directs the Secretary of Defense to request the governors of these states to order National Guard forces to perform duty on a fully reimbursable basis to support their state and local emergency assistance efforts. The memorandum extends the 100 percent federal cost share for the use of National Guard forces until May 31, 2020. The memorandum includes general provisions to ensure its implementation is consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
