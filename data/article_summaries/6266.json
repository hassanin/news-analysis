President Biden recently met with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall, FEMA Acting Associate Administrator for Response and Recovery David Bibo, and other members of his emergency preparedness team. The meeting focused on FEMA's ongoing efforts to prevent, prepare for, and respond to extreme weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme heat, and wildfires. The President stressed the importance of the federal government being prepared to quickly respond to various weather scenarios and provide support to affected communities. The discussion also centered on building resilience in communities facing extreme weather, which has been exacerbated by climate change. President Biden expressed gratitude to FEMA and other frontline agencies for their response to COVID-19, vaccination efforts, and support during recent winter storms and early fire season. In the coming week, the President will convene Cabinet officials, Western State Governors, and private sector partners to address the intersection of drought, heat, and wildfires in the Western United States. The focus will be on strengthening prevention, preparedness, and response efforts for this season, considering that the 2020 wildfire season alone resulted in significant economic damage and loss of lives. The meeting aims to enhance public safety and deliver assistance to people in times of urgent need through coordination between federal, state, and local governments and the private sector.
