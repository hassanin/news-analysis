On March 15, 1995, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency with respect to Iran due to the threat it posed to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. This was followed by several executive orders imposing sanctions on Iran. The President has taken additional steps to address this national emergency over the years. According to a National Security Presidential Memorandum issued on May 8, 2018, the actions and policies of the Iranian government, including its development of weapons capabilities, regional aggression, support for terrorist groups, and activities of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, continue to pose a threat to the United States. Therefore, the President has decided to extend the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This renewal is separate from the emergency declared in 1979 in connection with the hostage crisis. The notice of this extension will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
