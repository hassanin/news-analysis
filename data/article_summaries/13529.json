This article is a notice from the White House stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Libya. The national emergency was initially declared in 2011 due to the threat posed by Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his government, and close associates, who used extreme measures against the people of Libya. The emergency was also declared to protect Libyan state assets from being misappropriated. Although sanctions are being lifted in response to developments in Libya, including the fall of Qadhafi and the establishment of a democratically elected government, the situation still poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency must continue beyond February 25, 2013.
