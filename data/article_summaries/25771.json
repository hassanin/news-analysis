President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have confirmed and welcomed the final agreement on the United States-Japan Trade Agreement and the United States-Japan Digital Trade Agreement. These agreements aim to eliminate or reduce tariffs on certain agricultural and industrial products and establish high-standard rules in the digital trade sector. The United States and Japan plan to sign these agreements and enter them into force in the near future, after completing their respective domestic procedures. Additionally, the two nations intend to continue consultations and negotiations on customs duties, trade barriers, and other issues to promote fair and reciprocal trade. Both countries pledge to faithfully implement these agreements and refrain from taking measures against their spirit. They also aim to find an early solution to other tariff-related issues. These achievements are seen as a testament to the strong relationship between the United States and Japan.
