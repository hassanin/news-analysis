President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring May 5-11, 2013, as National Charter Schools Week. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of charter schools in providing opportunities for students to receive a quality education and acquire the skills necessary for future success. It highlights the role of charter schools as learning laboratories that allow educators to experiment with new models and methods to improve classroom excellence. The proclamation also emphasizes the need for high standards and accountability, stating that underperforming charter schools should be closed. However, successful charter schools should share their practices with other public schools and replicate those that yield significant results. The proclamation recognizes that charter schools often serve communities with limited educational options, making them valuable partners in expanding opportunities for students in need. The proclamation concludes by encouraging states and communities to support charter schools and the students they serve.
