Today, the United States, along with the United Kingdom and support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, and the Netherlands, conducted strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen. These strikes were in response to the rebels' attacks on international maritime vessels in the Red Sea, including the use of anti-ship ballistic missiles. These attacks have endangered personnel, threatened trade, and disrupted freedom of navigation. Over 50 nations have been affected by these attacks, with more than 2,000 ships forced to divert their routes. The international community has condemned these actions and launched Operation Prosperity Guardian to defend international shipping and deter further Houthi attacks. The United Nations Security Council has also passed a resolution demanding an end to these attacks. The targeted strikes are a clear message that the US and its partners will not tolerate attacks on their personnel or threats to freedom of navigation. Further measures may be taken to protect people and international commerce if necessary.
