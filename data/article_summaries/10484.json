Congressman Gary Peters supports the compromise tax-cut deal being negotiated by President Obama and Congressional Republicans. He believes that the deal is consistent with his stance on protecting middle-class families from a tax increase, extending unemployment benefits, and providing incentives for job creation. Although the deal is not his preferred approach, Peters believes that compromise is necessary to prioritize the needs of the middle class and those affected by the struggling economy.
