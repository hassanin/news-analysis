On April 4, 2018, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation to honor the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who was assassinated 50 years prior. The proclamation calls for Americans to embrace Dr. King's values of justice and peace, and to reject racism and division. President Trump emphasizes that it is the responsibility of the people, not the government, to achieve Dr. King's ideals and create a united, peaceful, and just nation. The proclamation also references President Abraham Lincoln's efforts to eliminate racial divisions with the Emancipation Proclamation, and highlights the ongoing work to recognize the beauty and humanity of all individuals, regardless of their skin color. The proclamation designates April 4, 2018, as a day to honor Dr. King's legacy and urges all Americans to contribute to making his dreams of peace, unity, and justice a reality.
