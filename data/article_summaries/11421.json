President Obama has proposed a Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee to be imposed on the debt of the largest financial firms until American taxpayers are fully compensated for the assistance provided to Wall Street during the financial crisis. The fee will be in place for at least 10 years and will only affect firms with more than $50 billion in assets. It is expected to raise up to $117 billion to repay the projected cost of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The fee aims to ensure that the taxpayer dollars used to stabilize the financial system are reimbursed by the financial sector. The President is fulfilling his commitment to provide a plan for taxpayer repayment three years earlier than required by law. The fee will primarily affect the largest and most highly leveraged firms, with over 60% of revenues expected to come from the 10 largest financial institutions.
