The First Family has taken several measures to prioritize the health and safety of the Residence staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. These include adopting hospital-grade disinfection policies, providing sanitization and filtration systems to staff members for use in their homes, requiring all staff to wear masks, and conducting daily and regular testing for those in direct contact with the First Family. The Residence has also hired independent health consultants and a 'well-being' consultant to address staff members' concerns and provide support, including mental health resources. In light of the President and First Lady's positive COVID-19 results, staff members now wear full personal protective equipment (PPE) and follow updated procedures to prevent cross contamination.
