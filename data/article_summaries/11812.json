This article is a press gaggle by Robert Gibbs, the Press Secretary at the White House. The press gaggle took place on July 23, 2009, aboard Air Force One en route to Cleveland, Ohio. The press asked Gibbs about President Obama's involvement in the matter between Professor Gates and the Cambridge police, and why the President chose to weigh in on it. Gibbs explained that the President did say he didn't have all the facts, but based on what was reported in the media, he believed cooler heads should have prevailed on both sides. The press also asked if the President had ever been a victim of racial profiling, to which Gibbs mentioned an instance mentioned in the President's book and a restaurant incident. The press further questioned Gibbs about the President's use of the term "stupidly" to describe the police's behavior, and if he regretted it. Gibbs clarified that the President was not calling the officers stupid, but rather denoting that the situation got out of hand. The press gaggle also briefly touched on the topic of health care reform and the President's involvement in negotiations on Capitol Hill. Finally, Gibbs mentioned that the President would be attending two fundraisers that evening.
