The White House Press Secretary expresses disappointment in the Supreme Court's decision regarding the case of Harris v. Quinn. The decision carves out a group of workers, specifically homecare workers, who will no longer have the ability to collectively bargain. The statement argues that collective bargaining is crucial for fair pay, high-quality service, and improved conditions for workers. The decision is seen as making it harder for these workers to receive fair treatment and for states and cities to provide care for the elderly and disabled. The administration reaffirms its commitment to defending collective bargaining rights.
