The article discusses the pressing issue of antibiotic resistance and the steps that the US government is taking to combat it. Antibiotic resistance is a major public health concern, causing millions of illnesses and deaths each year. It also poses economic threats, with billions of dollars in excess healthcare costs and lost productivity. In 2014, President Obama signed an Executive Order and released a National Strategy on Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria. The President's 2016 Budget proposes a historic investment of over $1.2 billion to combat and prevent antibiotic resistance. This funding will be used to improve antibiotic stewardship, enhance surveillance and reporting capabilities, and drive research innovation in human health and agriculture. The budget also supports efforts to improve education, strengthen diagnostic capabilities, and advance research and development of new antibiotics and alternatives to antibiotics. The goal is to reduce the incidence of antibiotic-resistant infections and fundamentally transform how public health prevents the transmission and emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
