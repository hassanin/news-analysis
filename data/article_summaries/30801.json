The Trump administration has announced two new rules aimed at lowering the price of prescription drugs in the United States. The first rule prevents middlemen from preventing discounts on prescription drugs from reaching Medicare patients. The second rule aims to end "global freeloading" by requiring the US government to pay the lowest price for drugs, matching the prices paid by other developed countries. These reforms are part of the administration's efforts to lower drug prices and put American patients first. The administration also highlighted other actions taken to lower drug prices, such as allowing drug imports from Canada and capping insulin costs for seniors.
