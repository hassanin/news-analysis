President Donald J. Trump has issued a posthumous pardon to John Arthur "Jack" Johnson, the first African American Heavyweight Champion of the World. Johnson was convicted under the Mann Act during a period of racial tension over a century ago. Many view his conviction as a racially motivated injustice. Johnson served 10 months in Federal prison. Despite his difficult upbringing as the child of former slaves, Johnson rose to the top of the boxing world and inspired generations with his tenacity and independent spirit. Congress has previously supported resolutions calling for Johnson's pardon, including one in 2015. President Trump believes that Johnson's historic athletic achievements and contributions to society make him worthy of a posthumous pardon. The President sees this as an opportunity to correct a historical wrong and honor the legacy of a champion.
