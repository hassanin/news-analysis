75 years ago, the Battle of Okinawa concluded with a victory for the United States. The battle was the last major battle of World War II and involved a fleet of American and British ships descending on the island of Okinawa to secure it as a strategic base. The battle cost over 200,000 lives, including nearly 100,000 Okinawan civilians. It lasted for 3 months and involved multiple battles on land and at sea. American and Allied troops faced treacherous terrains and demonstrated bravery and resolve. 23 Medals of Honor were awarded to American patriots for their gallantry and courage during the fighting. The sacrifice of those who fought in the battle led to the alliance between the United States and Japan, which is now a beacon for freedom and democracy. Today, that alliance is important in defending against potential adversaries. We remember the Greatest Generation and their valor, and draw from their patriotism and conviction as we work towards building a stronger and more united country.
