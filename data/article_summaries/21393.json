The White House Office of the Press Secretary has released a statement by National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice on new targets for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The statement highlights the progress made in the global fight against HIV/AIDS, with new infections and AIDS-related deaths decreasing by over 40%. The Obama Administration has invested nearly $50 billion in PEPFAR, building on the $15 billion provided by President Bush. Currently, PEPFAR supports life-saving antiretroviral treatment for 7.7 million individuals and has enabled over one million babies to be born HIV-free. In addition, more than 14 million pregnant women were tested and counseled last year alone. The statement announces bold new targets for PEPFAR for 2016 and 2017, including supporting 12.9 million people on life-saving treatment, providing 13 million male circumcisions for HIV prevention, and reducing HIV incidence by 40% among adolescent girls and young women in 10 sub-Saharan African countries. The statement emphasizes the need to empower adolescent girls and young women to combat HIV/AIDS, as 380,000 are infected every year. PEPFAR is now investing nearly half a billion dollars to support an AIDS-free future for this group. The statement also acknowledges the transition from the Millennium Development Goals to the Sustainable Development Goals and the shared responsibility of governments, the private sector, civil society, and faith-based organizations in achieving an AIDS-free generation and ending the epidemic by 2030.
