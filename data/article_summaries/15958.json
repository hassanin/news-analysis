On February 26, 2010, President Barack Obama signed Executive Order 13532, titled "Promoting Excellence, Innovation, and Sustainability at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)." The order aimed to strengthen the capacity of HBCUs to provide high-quality education, increase their participation in federal programs, and ensure that the United States has the highest proportion of college graduates by 2020. The order established the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), which would work with various partners to enhance the education provided by HBCUs and improve their relationship with the federal government. The order also established the President's Board of Advisors on HBCUs, which would advise the President and the Secretary of Education on matters related to strengthening the educational capacity of HBCUs. The order revoked Executive Order 13256, which was issued in 2002.
