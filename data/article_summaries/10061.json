The article is a message from President Barack Obama commemorating the 150th anniversary of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. President Abraham Lincoln issued this proclamation on September 22, 1862, stating that on New Year's Day, 1863, all people held as slaves in areas "in rebellion against the United States shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free." The article reflects on the progress made towards achieving liberty and justice for all since the proclamation was issued.

The article emphasizes the importance of the Emancipation Proclamation as a symbol of human freedom and calls for a rededication to its principles. It also celebrates the millions of Americans who have fought for liberty and equality in the years since the proclamation was issued.
