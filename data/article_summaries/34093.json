Today, on the National Day for the Victims of Communism, we remember the 100th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. This revolution led to the establishment of the Soviet Union and decades of oppressive communism, which is seen as incompatible with liberty, prosperity, and human dignity. Throughout the past century, communist regimes worldwide have been responsible for the deaths of over 100 million people and the exploitation and violence against countless others. These regimes falsely claimed to liberate people while infringing upon their basic rights, such as freedom of worship and association. Citizens seeking freedom were suppressed through coercion, violence, and fear. Today, we honor those who have died and those who continue to suffer under communism. We also reaffirm our commitment to spreading freedom and opportunity globally.
