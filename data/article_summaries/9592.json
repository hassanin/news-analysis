The White House has announced the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Venezuela. This emergency was initially declared in 2015 due to concerns over human rights abuses, persecution of political opponents, curtailment of press freedoms, violence and human rights violations in response to protests, and government corruption. The national emergency will be extended for another year.
