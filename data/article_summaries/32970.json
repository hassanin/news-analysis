This article is a proclamation issued by President Donald Trump on October 30, 2020. The proclamation discusses the suspension of duty-free treatment accorded under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) to certain eligible articles that are the product of Thailand, effective on December 30, 2020. It also includes modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) to reflect this suspension. Additionally, the proclamation modifies the HTS to withdraw the application of duty-free treatment to one eligible article, designates a certain article as an eligible article when imported from beneficiary developing countries, and disregards the competitive need limitation for certain eligible articles and beneficiary developing countries. The proclamation also reflects the change in the name of Macedonia to "North Macedonia" in the HTS. The modifications to the HTS will be effective from November 1, 2020, onwards. The proclamation supersedes any previous proclamations and executive orders that are inconsistent with its actions.
