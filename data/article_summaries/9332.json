The U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) recently held its fourth ministerial meeting in Sweden. The meeting was attended by high-level officials from both sides, including U.S. Co-Chairs Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, and United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai, as well as EU Co-Chairs European Commission Executive Vice Presidents Margrethe Vestager and Valdis Dombrovskis. The purpose of the meeting was to review progress and enhance cooperation on trade and technology between the U.S. and EU.

The U.S. and EU have a strong economic relationship, with nearly 800 million citizens sharing common values and principles. The changing international environment calls for joint collaboration to address the opportunities and challenges of the 21st century. The TTC serves as a key mechanism for delivering economic growth and prosperity for both sides.

The U.S. and EU have strengthened their ties through unprecedented cooperation in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They have aligned on sanctions and export controls, and have enhanced collaboration to address non-market policies, practices, and economic coercion. Both sides remain committed to democratic governance, human rights, and the rule of law.

The TTC working groups are expanding cooperation in trade and technology, focusing on areas such as technology standards, sustainable trade, innovation support, export controls, countering the misuse of technology, and cooperation in third countries. These working groups aim to address shared challenges in the global economy, including non-market policies and coercive economic actions that hinder economic growth.

To ensure a comprehensive dialogue, the TTC has sought input from various stakeholders, including industry, labor unions, academia, non-profit organizations, and environmental groups. Continued stakeholder input will be crucial for the TTC's future work.

During the fourth ministerial meeting, the U.S. and EU TTC co-chairs reviewed progress and announced key initiatives. The details of these initiatives were not mentioned in the summary.
