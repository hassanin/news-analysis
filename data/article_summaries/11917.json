The White House has launched the "Startup America" initiative to promote entrepreneurship and innovation. The campaign aims to encourage private sector investment in job-creating startups and small firms, accelerate research, and address barriers to success for entrepreneurs and small businesses. The administration plans to propose making the elimination of capital gains taxes on investments in small businesses permanent, as well as expanding the New Markets Tax Credit to encourage private sector investment in startups and small businesses in lower-income communities. The Small Business Administration (SBA) will also direct $2 billion in guarantee authority to match private sector investment funding for startups and small firms in underserved communities. Other initiatives include boosting mentorship for cleantech startups, launching new training programs for Veterans who want to start new businesses, and expanding programs that prepare students to start their own companies. The private sector and philanthropic commitments include expanding startup accelerators, scaling up programs that prepare students to start their own companies, increasing corporate investment and support for startups, and fostering innovation and entrepreneurship in various states and regions.
