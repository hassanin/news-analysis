On December 22, 2010, the President signed H.R. 3082 into law. This bill provides appropriations for the fiscal year 2011 and extends authority for current surface transportation programs. The appropriations will continue funding for ongoing projects and activities of the Federal Government until March 4, 2011. The extension of authority for surface transportation programs ensures that state departments of transportation and local transit agencies can continue their infrastructure investments.
