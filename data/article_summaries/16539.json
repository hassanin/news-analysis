President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the state of Montana, providing federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following flooding that occurred between May 19 and June 3, 2013. The declaration allows for federal funding to be available to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and repairs or replacement of facilities damaged by the flooding. The funding is available on a cost-sharing basis for the counties of Blaine, Chouteau, Custer, Dawson, Fergus, Garfield, Hill, McCone, Musselshell, Petroleum, Rosebud, and Valley, as well as the Fort Belknap, Fort Peck, and Rocky Boy's Reservations. Additionally, federal funding is available for hazard mitigation measures in all counties and tribes within the state. Thomas J. McCool has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, with the possibility of additional designations being made in the future based on further damage assessments.
