President Obama held a meeting at the White House to discuss the economic impact of infrastructure investment on states and local communities. The meeting was attended by Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood, former Secretaries of Transportation Norman Mineta and Samuel Skinner, and several governors and mayors. President Obama emphasized the need for a new plan to modernize and rebuild America's roads, railways, and runways. The goal is to rebuild 150,000 miles of roads, lay and maintain 4,000 miles of railways, restore 150 miles of runways, and advance a next-generation air-traffic control system. The investment in infrastructure is expected to create jobs and improve the economy. A new report from the Department of the Treasury and the Council of Economic Advisers highlights the positive economic impact of infrastructure investment, including job creation and increased economic output. The report also emphasizes the low construction costs and the potential to create jobs in sectors with high levels of unemployment.
