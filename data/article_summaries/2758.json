The White House Office of Presidential Personnel has released new data on the diversity and number of presidential appointees hired by the Biden-Harris Administration in its first 100 days. The administration has put its Statutory Cabinet in place faster than any other administration since President Reagan. President Biden has also announced his intent to nominate 233 individuals for Senate-confirmed leadership roles, which is more than any previous administration at the 100-day mark. Many of these leaders have made history, with Lloyd Austin being the first Black Secretary of Defense, Janet Yellen the first woman Secretary of the Treasury, Alejandro Mayorkas the first Latino and immigrant Secretary of Homeland Security, and Xavier Becerra the first Latino Secretary of Health and Human Services, among others. The administration has also made efforts to create a diverse cabinet, with Pete Buttigieg being the first openly LGBTQ person to serve in the Cabinet, Cecilia Rouse and Katherine Tai being the first women of color to hold their respective positions, and Avril Haines becoming the first woman to lead the U.S. intelligence community. The White House Office of Presidential Personnel has hired nearly 1,500 presidential appointees for key agency positions that do not require Senate confirmation, which is double the number hired by any previous administration at the 100-day mark. More than half of all Biden appointees are women, and half identify as non-white, setting a new standard for future administrations. The data also highlights the administration's commitment to representation from underrepresented communities, with a significant number of appointees being women, first-generation individuals, former educators, or American Indian or Alaska Natives in various government agencies.
