The White House has published a letter stating that the national emergency with respect to North Korea will continue beyond June 26, 2015. The letter highlights the existence and risk of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula, as well as the destabilizing actions and policies of the North Korean government. These actions are seen as a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, President Barack Obama has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
