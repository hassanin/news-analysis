The United States has welcomed Saudi Arabia's decision to open the Yemeni port of Hudaydah to humanitarian and commercial goods, including fuel. The US will also be funding the movement of cranes to Hudaydah. The US, being the largest humanitarian donor to Yemen, is committed to alleviating the suffering in the country. The US condemns the recent Houthi ballistic missile attack on the al-Yamamah Royal Palace in Riyadh and holds the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) responsible for enabling Houthi attacks. The US urges the United Nations Security Council to hold Iran accountable for its violations of Security Council resolutions. The US also calls for a political solution to the war in Yemen to achieve long-term stability and end the suffering of the Yemeni people.
