This article is a presidential proclamation by President Barack Obama, issued on June 20, 2014, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the GI Bill of Rights. The GI Bill, signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944, provided various benefits to veterans of World War II, including unemployment benefits, home loan guaranties, and subsidies for college education. The proclamation recognizes the impact of the GI Bill in allowing veterans to transition successfully into civilian life, contributing to the development of a highly educated workforce and the growth of the middle class. The proclamation also highlights the extension of similar educational opportunities to a new generation of veterans through the Post-9/11 GI Bill. President Obama calls on all Americans to observe the anniversary with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
