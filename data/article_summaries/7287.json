In September 2021, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States announced the establishment of AUKUS, a trilateral security partnership aimed at supporting an international order that respects human rights, the rule of law, and peaceful dispute resolution. The partnership has made significant progress in the past year towards Australia acquiring conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines. The leaders of the three countries emphasize their commitment to nuclear safety and non-proliferation, stating that Australia does not seek or acquire nuclear weapons. They also welcome the International Atomic Energy Agency's satisfaction with their engagement on this issue. AUKUS has also made strides in trilateral cooperation on advanced capability initiatives, such as hypersonics, electronic warfare, cyber, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, and undersea capabilities. The countries aim to promote information and technology sharing, integrate industrial bases and supply chains, and accelerate defense innovation. They express their commitment to working together with allies and partners to protect shared values and uphold the rules-based international order. On the one-year anniversary of AUKUS, they reaffirm their dedication to peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region.
