First Lady Jill Biden is joining leaders in Columbus, Ohio to kick off the city's Workforce Hub and announce plans to provide access to well-paying jobs created by President Biden's Investing in America agenda. Columbus is one of five Workforce Hubs, along with Pittsburgh, Augusta, Baltimore, and Phoenix, where investments from legislation such as the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are creating jobs. Columbus is a center for investment in industries such as semiconductor manufacturing, clean energy, biotechnology, high-performance computing, and transportation. The administration is working with Columbus State Community College and other stakeholders to ensure a skilled workforce. OhioHealth and Columbus State Community College have also announced a $120 million investment to train professionals in high-need healthcare occupations. The Biden-Harris Administration has attracted $31 billion in manufacturing investments in Ohio, including $20 billion from Intel for semiconductor manufacturing. In addition, the administration has awarded $7.2 billion for public infrastructure projects in Ohio and $1.4 billion for broadband infrastructure. The Columbus Hub partners will continue working with the administration to address the region's workforce needs. First Lady Jill Biden will also visit Augusta and Pittsburgh to highlight similar efforts in those communities.
