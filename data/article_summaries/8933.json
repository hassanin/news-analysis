Ohio voters have approved a constitutional amendment protecting a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. This is seen as a move to safeguard reproductive rights and prevent the enforcement of an abortion ban that would harm women and criminalize doctors. The results in Ohio highlight the belief held by the majority of Americans that politicians should not interfere in decisions that should be between a woman and her doctor. Similar efforts to defend reproductive freedom have been successful in other states such as Kansas, California, Michigan, Montana, Kentucky, and Vermont. While President Biden and Vice President Harris are working to protect reproductive freedom, there is concern over extremists pushing for a national abortion ban that would criminalize reproductive healthcare in every state. It is urged that Congress listens to the American people and passes a bill that restores the protections of Roe v. Wade, with President Biden committed to signing it into law.
