The Chair of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, Christina D. Romer, issued a statement on the employment numbers released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The report showed that the U.S. economy is contracting significantly, with a decline of 598,000 payroll employment in January. This brings the total job loss since the start of the recession in December 2007 to 3.6 million, the largest 13-month job loss since 1939. The unemployment rate also rose from 7.2% to 7.6%, with 11.6 million Americans now unemployed. Romer emphasizes the need for bold fiscal action to prevent further job losses and to heal the economy. She states that prompt, well-designed fiscal policy is crucial to stop the decline and lay the foundation for long-term economic growth. The American people are relying on leadership from Washington to help the economy recover.
