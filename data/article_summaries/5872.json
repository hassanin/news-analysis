The United States has welcomed Oman's decision to open its airspace to all civilian planes, including those flying to and from Israel. This move follows a similar decision by Saudi Arabia last year, during President Biden's visit to the Middle East. The announcement aligns with President Biden's vision of a more integrated, stable, and prosperous Middle East region. It also allows passengers to travel on direct routes between Israel, Asia, and other destinations for the first time in history. The United States has supported these efforts through diplomatic engagement, and expresses gratitude for Oman's partnership and the leadership of Sultan Haitham bin Tariq.
