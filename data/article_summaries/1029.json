The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Biden, is being hailed as the most significant climate legislation in U.S. history. The act aims to address environmental injustices and invest in communities that have been underinvested and underserved for too long. It includes historic investments in environmental justice, such as establishing new grant programs. The act also builds on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and advances the Justice40 Initiative, which aims to deliver 40% of the overall benefits of climate and clean energy investments to disadvantaged communities. The act focuses on reducing pollution, improving clean transit, making clean energy more affordable and accessible, and strengthening resilience to climate change. Overall, it aims to build a cleaner and more equitable future while growing the economy from the bottom up and the middle out.
