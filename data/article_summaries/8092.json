On November 18, 2021, the President signed into law three bills. The first bill, S. 921, known as the "Jaime Zapata and Victor Avila Federal Officers and Employees Protection Act," grants the United States extraterritorial jurisdiction over certain crimes committed against a Federal officer or employee serving abroad. The second bill, S. 1502, called the "Confidentiality Opportunities for Peer Support Counseling Act" or the "COPS Counseling Act," prohibits Federal law enforcement officers from disclosing the contents of peer support communications. It also requires the Department of Justice to develop a report on best practices and professional standards for peer support counseling programs for first responder agencies. The third bill, S. 1511, titled the "Protecting America's First Responders Act of 2021," expands eligibility requirements and increases certain benefits provided under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program administered by the Department of Justice. These bills have received bipartisan support and recognition for the leadership of various Senators and Representatives involved in their passage.
