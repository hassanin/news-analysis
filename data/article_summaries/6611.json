The President of the United States honors Captain Larry Taylor with the Medal of Honor for his extraordinary bravery and valor during the Vietnam War. Captain Taylor, a Cobra pilot, risked his own life to save a four-man Army patrol unit that was surrounded by enemy soldiers. Despite being low on ammunition and fuel, Captain Taylor made multiple dangerous runs to provide cover for the unit and distract the enemy. When the rescue helicopter was called off, Captain Taylor decided to extract the unit himself, a maneuver that had never been done before in a Cobra gunship. He landed his helicopter, instructed the unit to climb aboard, and evacuated them to safety. Captain Taylor's actions saved the lives of the four men, and he went on to complete over 2,000 combat missions during his military career.
