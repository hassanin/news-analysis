The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, announced on July 28, is a significant investment in America's infrastructure. It includes approximately $550 billion in new federal investment in areas such as roads, bridges, water infrastructure, internet, and more. The legislation aims to grow the economy, create jobs, and make the economy more sustainable and resilient. It will create good-paying, union jobs and is expected to add around 2 million jobs per year over the next decade. The bill also focuses on safety, public transit, passenger and freight rail, EV infrastructure, electric buses, reconnecting communities, airports, ports, and waterways, resilience and western water infrastructure, clean drinking water, high-speed internet, environmental remediation, and power infrastructure. The legislation is financed through a combination of redirecting unspent emergency relief funds, corporate user fees, tax enforcement, and other measures.
