The recent federal tax cuts in the United States have led to increased optimism among small business owners, according to surveys conducted by various organizations. This optimism is translating into job creation, with almost 3 million jobs created since President Trump was elected. The national unemployment rate has fallen to 4.1 percent, the lowest in 17 years, and wages are on the rise. Small businesses are benefiting from lower tax rates and deductions, allowing them to invest in their businesses and hire more workers. The Council of Economic Advisers predicts that the economy will grow by three percent on average over the next ten years, and household incomes will increase by about $4,000 per year due to the corporate tax cuts alone. The positive impact of these tax cuts is being felt by businesses and workers across the country.
