The U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs is scheduled to hold a hearing on the "CFIUS Reform: Administration Perspectives on the Essential Elements." The Administration supports the passage of the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act (FIRRMA). FIRRMA aims to modernize the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to protect national security and maintain an open investment policy. The United States has been a top destination for international investment, which benefits American workers and families through job creation, promotion of exports, research and development, and increased productivity. FIRRMA would expand CFIUS's review scope to address national security concerns that currently fall outside its purview. It would also update CFIUS procedures to make them more efficient and establish a CFIUS Fund and filing fees to support its work. The Administration looks forward to working with relevant committees to ensure the legislation achieves its intended effect.
