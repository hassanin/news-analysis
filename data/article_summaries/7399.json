The COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis caused disruptions in global supply chains, leading to empty store shelves, longer delivery times, and higher prices. The bottlenecks in critical inputs, such as semiconductors, exposed vulnerabilities in the US economy and national security. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia worsened the situation, highlighting the dangers of relying on concentrated production and fragile supply chains. The Biden-Harris Administration made supply chain resilience a priority and collaborated with industry and labor to address shortages and bottlenecks. As a result, supply chains have become more resilient, with improved transportation, warehousing, port throughput, delivery times, shipping reliability, and lower transportation costs. The White House Council of Economic Advisers released a blog showing that the normalization of supply chains is lowering prices and reducing inflation. President Biden signed an executive order for a 100-day review of critical supply chains, which resulted in over 70 completed recommendations, including financing for the battery supply chain, diversifying supply chains, and private sector investments in manufacturing. The report card highlights actions taken to strengthen supply chains, create jobs, and enhance domestic manufacturing capacity.
