First Lady Michelle Obama has announced two commencement challenges as part of her Reach Higher initiative. Schools that participate in the challenges will create video submissions showcasing their efforts to make college attendance and completion a reality for all students. Finalists may have the opportunity to hear from the First Lady at their commencement ceremonies in 2015. The Reach Higher initiative aims to inspire every student in America to complete their education beyond high school. The challenges include the FAFSA Completion Challenge, which urges high schools to increase the completion rates of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) among seniors, and the Near-Peer Mentoring College Challenge, which encourages college communities to enhance mentoring and college immersion experiences for high school students.
