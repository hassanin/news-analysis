The White House expressed deep regret over the decision by the Scottish Executive to release Abdel Basset Mohamed al-Megrahi, who was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for his role in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988. The United States believes that Megrahi should serve out his sentence in Scotland and has repeatedly expressed this to the UK and Scottish authorities. The White House extends its sympathies to the families affected by the bombing. Secretary of State Clinton, Attorney General Holder, and other US officials have been in contact with their counterparts in Scotland and the UK to emphasize their opposition to Megrahi's release.
