The White House is taking steps to reduce unnecessary occupational licenses in order to increase worker mobility and wages. Currently, almost a quarter of all U.S. workers require a government license for their jobs, which can result in unnecessary training, delays, and high fees. Research shows that licensed workers earn about 7% more than unlicensed workers with similar education and experience. The patchwork of state-by-state licensing rules also creates different requirements for the same occupations, making it difficult for workers to move across state lines. In response, the Department of Labor is providing $7.5 million in federal funding for organizations to work with states to enhance the portability of licenses and reduce burdensome restrictions. Additionally, since the release of the White House's recommendations in 2015, 11 states have proposed 15 reforms in line with these recommendations, and four bills have passed. The White House is also working to reduce licensing barriers for people with criminal records and to address licensing barriers for skilled immigrants.
