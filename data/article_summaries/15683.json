Vice President Joe Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko about the situation in Ukraine. They discussed the delivery of Ukrainian humanitarian assistance to the International Committee for the Red Cross, but noted that safe passage had not been secured from the separatists for the delivery of Russian aid. Both leaders agreed that Russia's actions, including sending military columns across the border into Ukraine and providing advanced weapons to the separatists, were inconsistent with improving the humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine. They reaffirmed their support for a diplomatic resolution and called on Russia to enter into good faith negotiations.
