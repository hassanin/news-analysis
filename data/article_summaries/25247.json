The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released its first monthly Employment Situation Report of 2019, showing that the United States economy continues to experience positive job gains. In January, total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 304,000 jobs, surpassing market expectations and the previous 12-month average gain. This marks the 100th consecutive month of positive job growth and the 16th straight month of employment growth with at least 100,000 new jobs. Although job gains in December were revised down and November jobs were revised up, the average monthly job creation in 2018 remains higher than in previous years. Several sectors, including mining and logging, transportation and warehousing, construction, education and health services, and leisure and hospitality, saw job growth in January. Since January 2017, the economy has added 4.9 million jobs, and since President Donald J. Trump was elected in November 2016, it has added 5.3 million jobs. Wages are also increasing, with nominal average hourly earnings rising by 3.2 percent over the past 12 months. Real wages, taking inflation into account, are also growing. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.0 percent in January, but this can be attributed to the partial government shutdown. The labor force participation rate for prime-age adults increased, reaching its highest level since April 2010. Overall, the January employment data indicate a strong American economy, with low unemployment, historic job gains, and rising wages, reflecting the success of the Administration's pro-growth, pro-worker policies.
