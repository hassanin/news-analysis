The article discusses the background and details of the annual pardoning of the National Thanksgiving Turkey by the President of the United States. In 2011, President Obama pardoned two turkeys named Liberty and Peace. The names were chosen from over 100 submissions to the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association's website, many of which came from school children in Minneapolis and St. Paul. After the ceremony, the turkeys were taken to George Washington's Mount Vernon Estate and Gardens, where they were displayed during the "Christmas at Mount Vernon" program. Eventually, they would live in a custom-made enclosure at Mount Vernon's livestock facility. Additionally, President Obama's family received two dressed turkeys from Jaindl's Turkey Farm in Pennsylvania, which would be donated to a local food bank.
