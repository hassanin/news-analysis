Ohio Governor Ted Strickland has expressed his support for a compromise tax and unemployment legislation currently before Congress. He criticized the Republican Party for being willing to give tax breaks to the richest Americans while arguing against providing unemployment insurance to those out of work. Strickland believes this shows a fundamental difference in the value systems of the two parties. He expressed anger at Washington Republicans for playing politics with the pocketbooks of middle-class Americans and called it the worst kind of elitism. Strickland emphasized that allowing current tax cuts to expire would result in smaller paychecks for many middle-class Ohioans, and letting unemployment insurance expire would be unconscionable. While acknowledging that the current deal is not perfect, he commended President Obama's efforts to reach a compromise and urged Congressional Democrats to make the bill even better for Ohioans. Strickland warned that letting the tax cuts expire and unemployment support fall away would pose risks to both the economy and Ohioans who work for a living.
