President Barack Obama has sent a letter to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13664 with respect to South Sudan will continue beyond April 3, 2015. The situation in South Sudan continues to threaten the peace, security, and stability of the country and the surrounding region. This includes widespread violence, atrocities, human rights abuses, recruitment and use of child soldiers, attacks on peacekeepers, and obstruction of humanitarian operations. President Obama has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency for the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
