President Donald J. Trump, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, and Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the United Arab Emirates, have agreed to fully normalize relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. This breakthrough is seen as a historic diplomatic achievement that will advance peace in the Middle East. The leaders praised the bold diplomacy and vision that led to this agreement, as well as the courage of both countries involved. Bilateral agreements will be signed in various areas, including investment, tourism, direct flights, security, telecommunications, technology, energy, healthcare, culture, the environment, and the establishment of reciprocal embassies. The normalization of relations will have significant economic and technological benefits for both countries. As a result of this agreement, Israel will suspend declaring sovereignty over certain areas outlined in the President's Vision for Peace and focus on expanding ties with other Arab and Muslim nations. The United States, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates are confident that more diplomatic breakthroughs are possible and will work together to achieve this. The countries will also cooperate in the treatment and development of a vaccine for the coronavirus. The normalization of relations will lead to a Strategic Agenda for the Middle East, promoting diplomatic, trade, and security cooperation. The United Arab Emirates' support for President Trump's Vision for Peace and their appearance at a White House reception in January 2020 are appreciated. Efforts will continue to achieve a just and lasting resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, allowing peaceful worshippers of all faiths to visit and pray at holy sites in Jerusalem. Prime Minister Netanyahu and Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed express their gratitude to President Trump for his dedication to peace in the region and his unique approach to achieving it.
