Vice President Mike Pence delivered remarks at the Department of Health and Human Services, expressing gratitude for the work being done and addressing the ongoing collapse of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). He thanked Secretary Tom Price and Administrator Seema Verma for their dedication to patient-centered healthcare. Pence highlighted the importance of the Department's work in improving the health and well-being of Americans, and emphasized the need to repeal and replace the ACA. He cited rising premiums and decreasing choices as evidence of the failure of the current healthcare system. Pence stated that the Trump administration seeks to create a dynamic national health insurance marketplace that lowers costs, increases quality, and gives more choices to working families. He also emphasized the need for state flexibility and the empowerment of individuals in making healthcare choices. Pence mentioned that the House of Representatives has passed the American Health Care Act, and the Senate is currently working on improving the legislation. He concluded by thanking the Department's employees for their service and expressing confidence in their ability to contribute to improving the healthcare system in the United States.
