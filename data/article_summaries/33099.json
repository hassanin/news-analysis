On March 4, 2019, President Donald Trump issued a statement to extend the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660. This national emergency was declared on March 6, 2014, in response to the actions and policies of individuals and the Russian government that undermined democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine, threatened its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and contributed to the misappropriation of its assets. The national emergency was expanded through subsequent executive orders issued on March 16, 2014 (Executive Order 13661), March 20, 2014 (Executive Order 13662), December 19, 2014 (Executive Order 13685), and September 20, 2018 (Executive Order 13849). The President determined that these actions and policies still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act, the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660 will continue for another year.
