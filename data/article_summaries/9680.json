President Obama has issued a new policy directive on security sector assistance. The goals of this policy are to help partner nations build sustainable capacity to address security challenges, promote support for US policies and interests, strengthen collective security and defense arrangements, and promote universal values. The security sector refers to institutions that use force to protect the state and its citizens, maintain international peace and security, enforce the law, and oversee security institutions and forces. Security sector assistance includes policies, programs, and activities to engage with foreign partners in building and sustaining effective security institutions. This collaborative approach is necessary due to the diversity and complexity of threats to national security. The directive aims to enhance the responsiveness, impact, and effectiveness of security sector assistance through better management and alignment across multiple agencies.
