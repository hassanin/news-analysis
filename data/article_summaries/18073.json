President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Arkansas due to severe storms and flooding that occurred from December 23, 2009, to January 2, 2010. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The funding will be available to help with emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has named Kevin L. Hannes as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made later if requested by the state.
