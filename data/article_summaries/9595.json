First Lady Michelle Obama is partnering with PBS and WGBH Boston to launch the fifth annual Healthy Lunchtime Challenge & Kids' "State Dinner". The challenge aims to promote cooking and healthy eating among children. Research shows that children who help with cooking and meal preparation are more likely to consume fruits and vegetables and make healthier food choices. The challenge invites children aged 8-12, in collaboration with a parent or guardian, to create an original lunch recipe that is healthy, affordable, and tasty. The recipes should meet the USDA's recommended nutrition guidelines and include ingredients from the entrant's state, territory, or community. Winners will have the opportunity to attend the Kids' "State Dinner" at the White House and have their recipes served. The winning recipes will also be featured in a downloadable e-cookbook. Parents and guardians can submit their child's recipe online, and winners will be notified in June.
