The Obama Administration has made significant progress in providing high-quality education and healthcare for veterans, as well as protecting vulnerable veterans and ensuring they receive the benefits they have earned. In terms of healthcare, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has increased access to care by hiring more staff, expanding facilities, improving productivity, and offering care in the community. The Administration is also working on reforms to streamline and improve the way VA delivers care in the community. In terms of benefits, the backlog of disability claims has been significantly reduced and the appeals process is being reformed. The Administration has also made efforts to end veteran homelessness, with Virginia becoming the first state to end veteran homelessness statewide. The Administration is committed to giving veterans economic opportunities by reducing unemployment rates, helping them find meaningful jobs, and improving education benefits. Finally, the Administration has provided increased funding for the VA and other agencies that support veterans.
