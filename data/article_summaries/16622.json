In this article, President Obama discusses the recently approved compromise to reduce the deficit and avoid a default that would have harmed the economy. He thanks the American people for pressuring their elected officials to work together for the benefit of the country. The compromise ensures over $2 trillion in deficit reduction and allows for investments in education and research while maintaining a fragile economy. However, the President emphasizes that this is just the first step and that both parties must collaborate on a larger plan to cut the deficit. He advocates for a balanced approach that includes adjustments to protect health care programs like Medicare, tax reform for the wealthy and corporations, and the elimination of taxpayer subsidies and loopholes. The President stresses the importance of not burdening the most affected by the recession and calls for everyone to contribute. He also pledges to continue fighting for new jobs, higher wages, and faster economic growth. The President criticizes the manufactured crisis surrounding the debt ceiling and its negative impact on the economy. He states that voters didn't choose dysfunctional government and calls for bipartisan steps to support businesses, increase consumer spending, extend tax cuts for the middle class, provide unemployment benefits, reform patent laws, pass trade deals, invest in infrastructure, and resolve the stalemate in the aviation industry. The President concludes by emphasizing that improving the economy is a collective responsibility and promises to propose additional ideas in the future to promote job creation and economic expansion. He urges Washington to work together, compromise, and take action to address the ongoing economic crisis faced by families and communities across the country.
