President Trump has added North Korea back to the State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism, in an effort to stop them from amassing a nuclear arsenal. The move is seen as a symbolic step with moral and practical impact. North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests and fired ballistic missiles over Japan, and is expected to soon be able to reach the continental US with a nuclear-armed missile. The re-listing highlights the North's criminal behavior and aims to further isolate the regime. The US is also working to cut off financial and other lifelines to the North, and will issue new sanctions that may further squeeze countries or companies doing business with North Korea. The conventional wisdom is that North Korea will not give up its nuclear program, but the only way to test that claim is by putting maximum pressure on the regime.
