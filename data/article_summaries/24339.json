In this statement from February 28, 2013, President Obama criticizes Republicans in the Senate for choosing to cut vital services instead of closing tax loopholes that benefit the wealthy. He argues that the burden of deficit reduction should not fall solely on the middle class and proposes a balanced approach of spending cuts and closing special interest tax loopholes. The President expresses frustration with Republicans refusing to allow an up-or-down vote on this approach, leading to arbitrary budget cuts that will harm the economy. He calls for leaders from both parties to come together and find a solution, emphasizing the need to stop creating manufactured crises and to prioritize the well-being of middle-class families. The President also highlights the progress made in deficit reduction but emphasizes the need for compromise to continue this progress.
