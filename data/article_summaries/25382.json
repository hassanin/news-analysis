On April 30, 2020, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to activate the regular Armed Forces of the United States for the purpose of enhancing the Department of Defense's counternarcotic operation in the Western Hemisphere. The order directs the Secretary of Defense to activate units and individual members of the Selected Reserve, not exceeding 200 at any one time, for a maximum of 365 consecutive days. The order states that it does not impede the authority of executive departments or agencies, or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and will be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. The order does not create any legally enforceable right or benefit against the United States or any other party.
