The article discusses the economic and commercial partnership between the United States and France. It highlights the importance of their economic relationship, which is based on bilateral trade and investment in each other's markets. France is a key source of foreign direct investment (FDI) and jobs in the United States, with French firms employing around 525,000 Americans in 2011. The United States is also a leading job-creating investor in France, with over 1,240 affiliates of U.S. firms supporting an estimated 440,000 jobs in 2012.

In terms of trade, France is the 8th largest goods trading partner of the United States. The aerospace sector accounts for almost 25% of bilateral goods trade, highlighting the interconnectedness of major aircraft manufacturers on both sides of the Atlantic. The United States and France are also significant trading partners in services.

To further enhance their economic cooperation, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the French Ministry of Economy and Finance have established a "U.S.-France Economic-Commercial Dialogue." This dialogue aims to facilitate the exchange of information and encourage discussions on boosting jobs, growth, and competitiveness through various means, including the development of small and medium-sized businesses, promotion of advanced manufacturing and innovation, workforce training, and market access issues. The potential benefits of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP) between the United States and the European Union will also be explored. The dialogue will be co-chaired by officials from both countries and is expected to hold its first meeting in May or June of 2014.
