President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Oklahoma and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred from April 28 to May 1, 2012. Federal funding will be provided to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Additionally, funding will be available for statewide hazard mitigation measures. Nancy M. Casper has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and further designations may be made if requested by the state and warranted by damage assessments.
