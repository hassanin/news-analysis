The Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence, delivered remarks at the departure ceremony of the USNS Comfort, a hospital ship that will provide medical care to those in need, especially those suffering in Venezuela. Pence expressed his concern for the Venezuelan people, who have been suffering under the oppressive regime of Nicolás Maduro. He highlighted the economic crisis, poverty, malnutrition, and lack of medical care in Venezuela, as well as the mass exodus of millions of Venezuelans to neighboring countries. Pence emphasized the United States' commitment to supporting Juan Guaidó as the legitimate President of Venezuela and called for Maduro to step down. He also addressed the issue of temporary protected status for Venezuelans in the United States and the need for continued pressure on Cuba, which is allegedly propping up the Maduro regime. Pence assured that the United States will continue to stand with the people of Venezuela until freedom and democracy are restored.
