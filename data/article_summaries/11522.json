First Lady Michelle Obama has announced the modernized Nutrition Facts label for packaged foods, which reflects the latest science, relevant nutrition information, and a refreshed design. The label, found on nearly 800,000 products, has not been significantly updated in twenty years. The revamped label includes changes such as highlighting key information like calories and servings per container, requiring the declaration of added sugars, updating serving sizes to reflect current consumption habits, and including a dual column label for certain food products. The updated label also includes an abbreviated footnote to explain percent Daily Value and an updated list of required nutrients. Compliance will be required within two years, with manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales having an additional year to comply.
