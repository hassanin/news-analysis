The Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, welcomed leaders from various sectors to discuss the global supply chain issue. She emphasized the interconnection and interdependence between nations, especially in terms of health, prosperity, security, and the global supply chain. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the difficulties in obtaining essential supplies worldwide, and the Delta variant continues to impact manufacturing and frontline workers. Labor leaders have expressed concerns about workplace safety and layoffs due to reduced production. The disruptions in the supply chain are caused by various factors, including the pandemic, climate crisis, and high global demand. Harris emphasized the need for collaboration and coordination among nations to address the supply chain disruptions. She commended Singapore's efforts and announced two new initiatives: the U.S.-Singapore Partnership for Growth and Innovation and the United States-Singapore Dialogue on Supply Chains. These initiatives aim to enhance supply chain resilience and promote cooperative efforts between the two countries. Harris sees this moment as an opportunity to address long-term challenges and build a more efficient and collaborative future.
