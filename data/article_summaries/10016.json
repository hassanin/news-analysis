In this press gaggle, Principal Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest makes two announcements. The first is that Vice President Biden will be leading a delegation to attend the inaugural Mass of Pope Francis in Rome. The delegation will also include New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, and the President of Georgetown University Jack DeGioia. The second announcement is about President Obama's visit to Argonne National Lab in Chicago, where he will be discussing the Energy Security Trust. The trust is a proposal to invest revenue from offshore oil and gas production in research dedicated to alternative forms of energy. The goal is to make the country and economy less dependent on foreign oil. Earnest also addresses questions about gun control, the Keystone XL pipeline, drones in Pakistan, the Israeli government, and immigration reform.
