Congresswoman Lois Capps and her family have served the people of California's Central Coast for almost four decades. She was a nurse and public health advocate for 20 years while her husband served in Congress. After her husband's passing, she ran for his seat and has continued his legacy of service for the past 17 years. Capps has been instrumental in efforts to increase access to healthcare, improve mental health services, prevent domestic violence, protect the environment, and enhance education. She has consistently been voted the "nicest member of Congress." While her experience, optimism, and tenacity will be missed, President Obama looks forward to working with her over the next two years and wishes her the best in her future endeavors.
