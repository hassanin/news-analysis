On April 27, 2017, President Donald Trump issued an executive order titled "Improving Accountability and Whistleblower Protection at the Department of Veterans Affairs." The purpose of this order is to enhance accountability and protection for whistleblowers within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The order directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish an Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection within the VA and appoint a Special Assistant to serve as the Executive Director of the Office. The Office will advise and assist the Secretary in disciplining or terminating any VA manager or employee who has violated the public's trust or failed to fulfill their duties on behalf of veterans. It will also identify any statutory barriers to disciplinary actions and report them to the Secretary for consideration of legislative changes. Additionally, the Office will work closely with relevant VA components to swiftly resolve veterans' complaints of wrongdoing and ensure adequate investigation and correction of wrongdoing throughout the VA. The order also includes general provisions that clarify its implementation and state that it does not create any new rights or benefits enforceable by any party against the United States or its entities.
