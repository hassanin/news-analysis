President Biden is leading an initiative with G20 partners to reshape and scale up the World Bank in order to effectively reduce poverty and promote inclusive economic growth. Progress has been made, with a coalition of countries coming together to reform the World Bank's mission, incentives, operational model, and financing capacity. These reforms could unlock $200 billion in new lending capacity over the next decade. President Biden has also nominated Ajay Banga to lead and revitalize the World Bank. To further advance progress, President Biden has asked Congress for support to unlock over $25 billion in new concessional World Bank financing. The aim is to boost the World Bank's capacity to support low- and middle-income countries. The initiative will make the World Bank a stronger institution capable of addressing global challenges and meeting the urgent needs of the poorest countries. President Biden will continue to push for further progress on evolving the World Bank and other multilateral development banks, with concrete results expected by the Rio de Janeiro Summit in 2024.
