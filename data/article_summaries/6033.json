Five years ago, a school shooting at Santa Fe High School in America claimed the lives of eight young people and two teachers. The families, classmates, and colleagues of the victims continue to deal with the trauma and heartbreak caused by this tragic event. One of the ongoing tragedies is the lack of meaningful gun control legislation by Congressional Republicans. Guns are the leading cause of death for children in America, yet there has been a failure to address this epidemic. School shootings have become all too common, turning educational institutions into scenes of violence instead of safe spaces. The author is working to maximize the impact of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and is taking executive actions to reduce gun violence. However, federal legislation is essential. The author calls for Congress to pass laws that require safe storage, ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, enforce universal background checks, and end immunity for gun manufacturers. The focus should be on education, not on preparing for violence.
