The article is a letter from President Donald Trump to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, informing her that her trip to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan has been postponed due to the government shutdown. Trump suggests that it would be more appropriate for Pelosi to be in Washington negotiating with him and supporting the Strong Border Security movement. He also suggests that Pelosi could still make the trip by flying commercial if she chooses. Trump expresses his hope that the attention, funding, and security needed for the Southern Border will be addressed soon.
