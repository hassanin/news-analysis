The White House Office of the Vice President has released a fact sheet outlining steps being taken to improve outcomes for foster youth in the United States. Currently, there are over 400,000 children in the foster care system, with over 100,000 waiting to be adopted. Every year, 23,000 youth age out of the system without finding permanent families. These youth face challenges in education, employment, financial security, and the criminal justice system. African-American and Native-American children are disproportionately represented in the foster care system. The fact sheet highlights several initiatives aimed at supporting foster youth, including ensuring access to healthy meals, protecting the welfare of Native youth, building financial security, keeping young people out of the justice system, creating clear pathways to employment, supporting educational success, and developing public service and private investment opportunities. The fact sheet also encourages individuals to consider becoming foster or adoptive families to provide permanent and loving homes for these youth.
