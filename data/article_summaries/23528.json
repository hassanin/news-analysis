President Barack Obama announced his intention to nominate Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius as Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) and released $155 million of ARRA funds for health clinics across America. Sebelius will oversee a department responsible for implementing the President's vision for healthcare, working to cut costs, expand access, and improve the quality of healthcare for all Americans. Nancy-Ann DeParle, a leading expert on healthcare and regulatory issues, will serve as Counselor to the President and Director of the White House Office for Health Reform. The released funds will support 126 new health centers, providing primary and preventive healthcare services to those in need, including many without health insurance. The grants are expected to create 5,500 jobs.
