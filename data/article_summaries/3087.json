The article discusses the negative impact of a recent decision on Texans' access to reproductive healthcare. Texas had filed a lawsuit to block medical providers from offering life-saving and health-preserving care, which could now result in women being denied vital treatment for conditions like severe hemorrhaging or life-threatening hypertension. The article argues that this decision is wrong and backwards, emphasizing the potential consequences of women dying as a result. It suggests that the fight is not over and that the President will continue to advocate for requiring hospitals to provide reproductive care. The article calls on Congress to pass a law restoring the protections of Roe v. Wade to secure a woman's right to choose. It warns of the choice between a national abortion ban and further attacks on fundamental rights, urging Americans to defend the rights protected by Roe. The President is committed to defending the rights of women in need of emergency reproductive care, while urging citizens to use their voices to restore those rights.
