First Lady Michelle Obama will be participating in a series of events throughout the month of March to support adolescent girls' education around the world as part of the Let Girls Learn initiative. More than 62 million girls globally, with more than half of them being adolescents, are not in school due to physical, cultural, and financial barriers. The First Lady will be delivering remarks and announcing private sector commitments in support of Let Girls Learn on International Women's Day. She will also participate in a spousal program with Mrs. Sophie Gr√©goire Trudeau of Canada to raise awareness for global girls' education. Additionally, the First Lady will address attendees at the SXSW Music Conference in Austin to discuss Let Girls Learn and ways students can take action on critical issues. During the President and First Lady's trip to Cuba and Argentina, Mrs. Obama will continue to highlight Let Girls Learn and meet with young people to discuss global citizenship through education and community leadership. Finally, she will attend the 2016 Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award ceremony, which recognizes women around the world who have shown exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for peace, justice, human rights, gender equality, and women's empowerment.
