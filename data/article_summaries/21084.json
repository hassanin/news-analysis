President Obama has announced new steps from the Department of Education to help students and parents make better college choices. This includes the release of a new College Scorecard, redesigned with input from students and families, which provides clear and reliable national data on college cost, graduation rates, debt, and post-college earnings. The Scorecard allows users to rate colleges based on what matters most to them and highlights colleges that are serving students well. The Department of Education has also published new, comprehensive data on higher education institutions, including employment outcomes and student-level outcomes. In addition, 11 organizations are using this new data to launch new tools to help students search for and compare colleges. The goal is to provide better information to help students choose colleges that will help them learn, graduate, and find jobs. The Administration is also working to support higher education leaders, policymakers, and researchers in improving measures of college performance and providing the best information and tools on college quality. This includes ongoing efforts to hold higher education institutions to high standards for serving students well. The Administration hopes that increased transparency in college data will stimulate innovation and discovery in higher education.
