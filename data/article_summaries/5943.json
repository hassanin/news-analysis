The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Biden, aims to build an economy that benefits working families and small businesses. It includes measures to lower prescription drug costs, healthcare costs, and energy costs, while also addressing the climate crisis. The act asks the super wealthy and large corporations to pay their fair share, while ensuring that no small business or family making under $400,000 per year will pay more in taxes. The legislation will reduce costs for small businesses by maintaining lower healthcare costs, supporting energy-saving investments, and strengthening supply chain resiliency. It extends premium tax credit supports for Affordable Care Act plans, benefiting small business owners and self-employed individuals. The act also includes provisions to save small businesses money on energy costs and combat climate change. It is designed to reduce the deficit, building upon previous debt reduction efforts. The act also focuses on lowering prescription drug costs for seniors and expanding economic opportunities for small businesses. It doubles the Research and Development (R&D) Tax Credit for small businesses and invests in American manufacturing and competitiveness. The legislation creates a Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator to support clean energy financing and expands opportunities in rural areas. Additionally, the act aims to reform the tax code, making it fairer for small businesses and working families. It includes investments in the Internal Revenue Service to provide better access to tax benefits and ensure that no family or small business making less than $400,000 per year sees an increase in taxes.
