This executive order, issued on June 2, 2020, prioritizes international religious freedom as a moral and national security imperative for the United States. It states that religious freedom is a fundamental right for all individuals and that religious communities and organizations are vital partners in promoting this freedom worldwide. The Secretary of State is directed to develop a plan within 180 days to prioritize international religious freedom in foreign policy and foreign assistance programs. Additionally, at least $50 million per fiscal year is to be budgeted for programs that advance international religious freedom. The order also emphasizes the integration of religious freedom into United States diplomacy and requires training for federal officials on international religious freedom. Economic tools, such as realigning foreign assistance or restricting visas, may be used to advance religious freedom in countries that violate this right. The order provides definitions and general provisions, and states that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States.
