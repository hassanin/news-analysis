President Obama spoke with President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority to express his strong support for President Abbas's leadership and commitment to peace. They discussed the positive developments in Gaza and the West Bank, as well as progress in the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian proximity talks. The President emphasized the need to move towards direct talks in order to reach a lasting agreement that establishes an independent Palestinian state living peacefully alongside Israel. Special Envoy Mitchell will be traveling to the region soon to build on this progress.
