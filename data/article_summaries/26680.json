During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders announced that three American detainees in North Korea will be returning home, which the President views as a positive gesture. Total denuclearization remains a top priority. Sanders also mentioned that CIA Acting Director Gina Haspel appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee and outlined her focus on positioning the CIA for success. The President is traveling and won't have a briefing the next day, so Sanders took the opportunity to wish her daughter a happy birthday. She also addressed questions about the President's potential request to restart the interrogation program, the Iran deal, the revocation of press credentials, Michael Cohen's financial records, the upcoming summit with North Korea, the infrastructure bill, and the DACA discharge petition. Sanders declined to comment on the President's views on torture, his personal attorney selling access to him, and the President's response to criticism from former Obama administration officials on the Iran decision. Finally, she confirmed that the President still has confidence in Rudy Giuliani.
