On May 4, 2017, President Donald Trump issued an executive order titled "Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty". The order states that it is the policy of the executive branch to enforce protections for religious freedom. It emphasizes the importance of religious voices and views in the public square and aims to protect individuals and organizations from discrimination or retaliation by the federal government based on their religious beliefs. The order also directs executive departments and agencies to respect and protect the freedom of religious and political speech, particularly in regards to moral or political issues from a religious perspective. The Secretary of the Treasury is instructed to ensure that the Department of the Treasury does not take adverse action against individuals or religious organizations based on their speech. The order also addresses conscience-based objections to the preventive-care mandate and calls for the consideration of amended regulations. The Attorney General is directed to issue guidance interpreting religious liberty protections in federal law to guide all agencies. The order includes a provision for severability, stating that if any provision is held invalid, the rest of the order remains unaffected. The order concludes by stating that it does not impair the authority of executive departments or agencies, and it should be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. It also clarifies that the order does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
