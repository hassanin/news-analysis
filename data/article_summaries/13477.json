First Lady Michelle Obama will be harvesting the White House Kitchen Garden on June 3, 2015. The garden was originally planted in 2009 to start a national conversation about health and wellbeing, which led to the Let's Move! initiative. This year's harvest will highlight the importance of pollinators in the food we grow and consume. Mrs. Obama also planted a pollinator garden last year to support bees, monarch butterflies, and other pollinators. Pollinators play a crucial role in agricultural production and are responsible for one out of every three bites of food we eat. There are efforts underway to support pollinator health and habitat, including the Million Pollinator Garden Challenge, which encourages people to create gardens that help revive pollinator health. Children from schools participating in the Let's Move! programs will join Mrs. Obama for the harvest, representing the millions of Americans impacted by the initiative. The event will be livestreamed on the White House website.
