On July 11, 2018, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to establish a Task Force on Market Integrity and Consumer Fraud within the Department of Justice. The purpose of this task force is to strengthen the efforts of the Department of Justice and other agencies in investigating and prosecuting crimes of fraud committed against the U.S. Government or the American people. The task force will be chaired by the Deputy Attorney General and will include various members from the Department of Justice, as well as senior officials from other executive departments and agencies. The task force's functions include providing guidance for the investigation and prosecution of fraud cases, making recommendations to the Attorney General on fraud enforcement initiatives, and making recommendations to the President on enhancing cooperation among agencies and authorities in the investigation and prosecution of fraud and other financial crimes. This executive order replaces the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force created in 2009 and will be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. The task force will terminate when directed by the President or the Attorney General.
