The leaders of France, Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom have condemned the attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, UK, on March 4, 2018. They express sympathy for the victims and admiration for the UK police and emergency services. They state that the use of a military-grade nerve agent, developed by Russia, is a violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and international law, and it threatens the security of all nations. The UK has informed its allies that Russia is likely responsible for the attack, and the leaders agree that there is no plausible alternative explanation. They call on Russia to address the UK's requests and provide full disclosure of the Novichok program to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). They also express concerns about Russia's past irresponsible behavior and urge Russia to uphold international peace and security as a member of the UN Security Council.
