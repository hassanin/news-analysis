Today marks the 230th anniversary of the United States Customs Service, which eventually became the United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP). President George Washington signed a law on July 31, 1789, to govern the collection of duties on ships and imported goods. The Customs Service has always focused on protecting the country's borders and preserving the integrity of ports of entry. In 2003, CBP was established to continue this mission into the 21st century. CBP has grown into one of the world's largest law enforcement organizations, ensuring the safety and prosperity of the nation. However, the brave men and women of CBP often go unrecognized for their efforts. The administration pledges to support law enforcement personnel, provide necessary resources and training, and address the crisis at the southern border. On this day, the historical significance of the Customs Service is acknowledged, and over 60,000 CBP employees are commended for their dedication to protecting the American people.
