President Obama has signed an emergency declaration for the state of Ohio, ordering federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts following severe storms that began on June 29, 2012. The declaration authorizes the Department of Homeland Security, specifically the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster relief efforts and provide assistance for emergency measures to save lives, protect property, and ensure public health and safety. FEMA is authorized to mobilize resources and equipment to alleviate the impacts of the emergency, with 75 percent federal funding for emergency protective measures. W. Michael Moore has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
