This article is a presidential memorandum issued by Barack Obama on December 29, 2009. The memorandum directs various government departments and agencies to conduct a review of the watchlisting system in response to the attempted terrorist attack on Northwest flight 253 on December 25, 2009. The review should include an inventory of all relevant intelligence or information prior to the incident, how it was handled and shared, and the standards and processes for placing individuals on the Terrorist Watchlist. The review should not interfere with ongoing criminal investigations. The departments and agencies are instructed to provide initial findings and recommendations to the White House Staff Secretary by December 31, 2009.
