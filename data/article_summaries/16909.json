In September 2011, President Obama made a statement celebrating the repeal of the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy. He expressed that this discriminatory law, which required members of the military to hide their sexual orientation, was finally and formally repealed. The President emphasized that patriotic Americans in uniform would no longer have to lie about who they are in order to serve their country. He also highlighted that the armed forces would no longer lose the skills and combat experience of gay and lesbian service members. The President thanked those who fought for change, including members of Congress from both parties who voted for the repeal, civilian and military leaders who ensured a smooth transition, and the men and women in uniform who showed readiness to move forward together. He acknowledged that the repeal was a step towards equality and fairness, and a testament to the progress of extending America's promise to all citizens. The President concluded by stating that this achievement further solidified the United States' position as having the finest military in the world and as a nation fulfilling its founding ideals.
