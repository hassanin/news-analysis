The United States is committing $10 billion to address global hunger and invest in sustainable food systems. This commitment aims to address immediate malnutrition and ensure long-term food security. The US is focused on developing innovative, inclusive, and science-based solutions to transform food systems. This includes leveraging well-functioning markets, expanding income opportunities, stabilizing food supply and prices, reducing food loss and waste, and improving dietary diversity and nutrition. Building sustainable food systems requires work in social, economic, and environmental dimensions. The US is also committed to reducing agriculture's environmental impact and adapting to climate change. The US government, along with global partners, participated in the UN Food Systems Summit to spur urgent action. The US announced a planned multi-year investment of over $10 billion to promote food systems transformation through innovation and climate-smart agriculture, improved infrastructure, inclusive market opportunities, women's and children's needs, nutrition, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Domestically, the US will invest $5 billion to strengthen food systems, ensure access to healthy diets, and improve inclusivity and resilience. The US will also commit $5 billion over five years to the Feed the Future initiative, which aims to reduce poverty, hunger, and malnutrition globally.
