During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest expressed frustration with the Senate's failure to pass gun control legislation. He criticized Republicans for blocking common-sense proposals and accused them of protecting the gun lobby rather than the American people. Earnest also emphasized the need for Senate Republicans to consider Chief Judge Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court. He highlighted the nonpartisan American Bar Association's evaluation of Garland, which unanimously concluded that he merits the highest rating. Earnest argued that Senate Republicans have abdicated their constitutional responsibility and urged them to do their job. Additionally, Earnest discussed the issue of terrorism and the use of the term "radical Islamic extremism." He stated that using this term is not a counterterrorism strategy but rather a political talking point. Earnest emphasized that the President has put forward a specific strategy for combating terrorism, including building a coalition of 65 countries to fight against ISIS. He criticized Republicans for opposing common-sense gun legislation and failing to offer their own strategy for protecting the American people. Earnest also discussed the closure of Guantanamo Bay, stating that the President and his national security team believe it is a national security priority. He mentioned the possibility of allowing prisoners to plead guilty to terrorism charges via videoconference, but did not provide details. Earnest acknowledged the challenges in closing Guantanamo Bay due to obstacles erected by Congress but expressed hope that progress could be made.
