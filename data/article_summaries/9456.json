The President applauds Senators Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey for their bipartisan agreement on background checks for gun purchases. While the President acknowledges that there are aspects of the agreement that he would prefer to be stronger, he sees it as a significant step forward. The President emphasizes that there are good people on both sides of the gun control issue and that action needs to be taken to address gun violence. However, there is still work to be done, including overcoming obstruction in the Senate and getting the bill approved in the House. The President calls on the American people to continue advocating for these measures to be voted on and to protect families and communities.
