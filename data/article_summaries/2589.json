American aid worker Jeff Woodke has been released from captivity in West Africa after being held hostage by terrorists for over six years. The United States expresses gratitude to the Nigerien government for their assistance in securing Woodke's release. The efforts of various U.S. Government agencies, including the Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, the U.S. military, and the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, were instrumental in making this possible. The Administration remains committed to bringing home Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained worldwide.
