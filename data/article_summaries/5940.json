The House has made progress in advancing legislation aimed at strengthening supply chains and boosting innovation in the US economy to compete with China and other countries. The proposals focus on investments in the industrial base and research and development, similar to what helped the US lead the global economy in the 20th century. The goal is to bring back manufacturing jobs and address supply chain bottlenecks that have led to higher prices for the middle class. This legislation builds on previous investments in infrastructure and aims to create good-paying jobs for all Americans while also addressing the climate crisis. The President is encouraged by the bipartisan work in Congress and hopes to see the legislation on his desk soon to demonstrate that the 21st century will be the "American century."
