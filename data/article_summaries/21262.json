This article summarizes the findings of a White House review of the attempted terrorist attack on December 25, 2009, when a Nigerian national tried to detonate an explosive device on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. The review identified three main failures that led to the attack: a failure of intelligence analysis, a failure within the counterterrorism community to assign responsibility and accountability for following up on threats, and shortcomings in the watchlisting system. The review found that the U.S. government had sufficient information to potentially disrupt the attack but failed to connect the dots and take action. It also highlighted the need for improvements in intelligence analysis, threat tracking, and watchlisting procedures. The review concluded that a reorganization of the intelligence or counterterrorism community was not necessary, but rather a strengthening and improvement of existing systems.
