This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Libya. The national emergency was declared on February 25, 2011, due to the threat posed by Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his government, and close associates who used extreme measures against the people of Libya. The emergency was also declared to protect Libyan state assets from being misappropriated. Despite positive developments in Libya, including the fall of Qadhafi's government, the situation in Libya still poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2011 will continue for another year.
