President Donald J. Trump outlined his strategies for reducing the tax burden on American businesses and individuals in order to promote American prosperity. He described four principles guiding tax reform under his administration: a simplified tax code, a competitive tax rate, relief for the middle class, and repatriation of American dollars. The goal is to streamline the tax code, reduce burdens on the middle class, and encourage American companies to invest in the American economy. Trump referred to his four-point tax plan as "The American Model" and called on citizens to dream big and bold things for the country.
