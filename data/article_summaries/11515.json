President Obama has proposed a two-year extension for the term of FBI Director Robert Mueller, which is set to expire on September 4, 2011. Obama believes that continuity and stability at the FBI are crucial given the ongoing threats facing the United States. Mueller has been praised for his leadership and effectiveness in transforming the Bureau into a pre-eminent counterterrorism agency. He has a strong background in law enforcement and national security, and has received numerous awards for his service in the United States Marine Corps. Mueller has served as FBI Director since September 4, 2001, and President Obama is the fourth President to ask him to serve in a Senate-confirmed position.
