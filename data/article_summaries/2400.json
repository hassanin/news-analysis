President Biden has announced that $10 billion in American Rescue Plan funds have been committed to public safety and violence prevention. This includes at least $6.5 billion in State and Local funds from more than half of states and over 300 communities across the country. The funding will be used for strategies such as community policing, violence intervention programs, and strengthening neighborhoods with educational and economic opportunities.

The American Rescue Plan funding has been crucial for communities facing budget uncertainties due to the pandemic. It has allowed mayors and other leaders to invest in public safety and prevent significant cuts to police budgets and services. However, all Congressional Republicans voted against this funding.

President Biden is renewing his call for communities to invest more American Rescue Plan funding in making communities safer, especially before the summer months when violent crime tends to increase. The Treasury Department is releasing the second tranche of support for state and local governments to further aid in these efforts.

The article also provides examples of specific communities that are leveraging American Rescue Plan funds to strengthen their budgets and enhance public safety. President Biden will meet with mayors, police chiefs, and community violence intervention leaders from these communities.
