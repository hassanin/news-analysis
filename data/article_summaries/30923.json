President Donald Trump addressed the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York, emphasizing the need for international cooperation on UN reform. He was accompanied by UN Secretary General Ant√≥nio Guterres and US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley. Haley stated that the support for UN reform was intended to bring efficiency, accountability, and transparency to the organization. Trump highlighted the three main goals of UN reform: affirming human dignity and international peace, addressing bureaucracy and mismanagement, and focusing more on people and less on bureaucracy. He called for greater accountability, equal distribution of military and financial burdens, and clearly-defined goals for peacekeeping missions. Later, Trump is scheduled to have bilateral meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and French President Emmanuel Macron.
