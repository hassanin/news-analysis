First Lady Michelle Obama has joined forces with Goya Foods to promote the USDA's MyPlate initiative, which encourages healthy eating choices. Goya Foods, the largest Hispanic-owned U.S. food company, is committing resources to help families make healthy meal choices with easy-to-follow guides on proper portions. They are creating brochures, posters, coupons, and cookbooks for consumers, as well as developing educational tools for students. Goya Foods will also imprint the MiPlato symbol on some of their products. The initiative has received support from various Latino organizations, who will help distribute the materials and promote healthy eating in their communities.
