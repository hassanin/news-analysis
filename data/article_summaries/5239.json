Russia launched its largest aerial assault on Ukraine since the war began, using drones and missiles, including hypersonic missiles, to target cities and civilian infrastructure. Maternity hospitals, shopping malls, and residential areas were hit, resulting in the deaths of innocent people and injuries to many more. The attack serves as a reminder that Putin's objective remains the destruction of Ukraine and the subjugation of its people. Ukraine successfully intercepted and destroyed many of the missiles and drones using air defense systems provided by the United States and its allies. However, unless Congress takes urgent action, the support in terms of weapons and air defense systems for Ukraine will cease. The fight in Ukraine has broader implications for the NATO alliance, European security, and the Transatlantic relationship. Putin's actions not only threaten Ukraine but also some NATO allies, increasing the risk of direct involvement by the United States. Over 50 countries have rallied to support Ukraine's defense, and it is crucial not to let down allies and partners in the face of this aggression. Failure to answer the call for freedom will be judged harshly by history.
