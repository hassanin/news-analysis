On June 20, 2023, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced the continuation of the national emergency declared on July 19, 2022, regarding hostage-taking and the wrongful detention of United States nationals abroad. This national emergency was declared in response to the threat posed by terrorist organizations, criminal groups, and foreign states that engage in hostage-taking and wrongful detention for financial, political, or other gain. These acts undermine the rule of law and pose a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The continuation of this national emergency is necessary to address this ongoing threat and ensure the safety of United States nationals and other individuals abroad.
