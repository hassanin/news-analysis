On the one-year anniversary of the Startup America Initiative, President Obama sent a Startup America Legislative Agenda to Congress. The agenda aims to expand tax relief and unlock capital for startups and small businesses. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security will take steps to attract and retain foreign-born entrepreneurs and highly-skilled immigrants. The Administration also announced several new agency actions to accelerate the growth of young, job-creating companies. The Startup America Legislative Agenda includes four tax breaks for small businesses and four proposals to expand access to capital. It also addresses immigrant visa backlogs. The President called on Congress to pass a bipartisan bill that further expands access to capital and cuts taxes for entrepreneurs and small businesses. The Administration also announced various initiatives to promote startups and small businesses, including challenges fueling regional innovation, the America's Next Top Energy Innovator program, building a regional mentor network, the National Education Startup Challenge, and the Startup America Policy Challenge.
