President Biden and G7 leaders have announced the Build Back Better World initiative, which aims to address the infrastructure needs in developing countries. The partnership will focus on values-driven, high-standard, transparent, and catalytic infrastructure projects. Efforts are being made by the United States and G7 partners to increase the ambition and impact of the partnership. The goals of the initiative include tackling the climate crisis, creating jobs, supporting economic recovery, promoting gender equity, and investing in health and health security. The G7 leaders' statement reflects the progress made since June and outlines future infrastructure collaboration. The United States will launch its formal Build Back Better World initiative early next year. The government is assessing how to better use its development infrastructure toolkit, including direct financing tools and leveraging international financial institutions and partners. The aim is to ensure that infrastructure projects meet the needs of middle and lower-income countries and adhere to high labor and environmental standards. The Build Back Better World initiative seeks to provide transparent and sustainable financing to promote prosperity and global competitiveness for American firms and workers.
