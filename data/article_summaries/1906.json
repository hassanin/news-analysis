Mark Frerichs, who was taken captive in Afghanistan in January 2020, has been released after being held for 31 months. The successful resolution of his release was the result of extensive efforts by government officials and partner governments. The president spoke with Mark's sister to share the good news and express his happiness for Mark's family. The focus now is on ensuring Mark's safe return and providing him with the support he needs to transition back into society. The administration remains committed to bringing home all Americans who are held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. Although there is still more work to be done in other cases, Mark's release demonstrates their ongoing commitment to this mission.
