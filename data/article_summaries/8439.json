Metropolitan Police Department, and other law enforcement officials for their service in defending democracy during the January 6th insurrection. The President expressed gratitude to the law enforcement officers for their bravery and sacrifice, acknowledging the physical and emotional toll they endured during the attack. He also honored the memory of officers Brian Sicknick and Billy Evans, who lost their lives in the line of duty. President Biden emphasized the importance of facing the truth about what happened on that day and called for unity in preserving and perfecting democracy. The Congressional Gold Medal awards will be displayed at various locations to honor the heroism of the officers and remind all who visit of their service.
