President Trump met with governors from both parties to discuss reforming occupational licensing laws, advancing childcare policies, and providing job training to Americans. The President's daughter, Ivanka Trump, who has been working on these issues, highlighted the success of the administration's efforts, including the creation of over 10 million jobs and the engagement of private sector companies in workforce development initiatives. The governors shared their state-specific approaches to workforce development, including vocational education programs, apprenticeships, and criminal justice reform. They also discussed the need for occupational licensing reform to remove barriers to employment and improve access to quality jobs. The President praised the governors for their work and emphasized the importance of bipartisan cooperation to address these issues.
