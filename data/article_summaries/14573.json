President Barack Obama has notified Congress of his intent to terminate the designations of Gibraltar and the Turks and Caicos Islands as beneficiary developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. This decision is based on the determination that both territories have become "high income" countries according to the World Bank's official statistics. As a result, their eligibility for trade benefits under the GSP program will end on January 1, 2014.
