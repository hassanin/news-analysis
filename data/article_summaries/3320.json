The article discusses the continuation of the national emergency declared by President Biden with respect to North Korea. The national emergency was initially declared in 2008 due to the proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula. Over the years, the scope of the national emergency has been expanded to address various threats posed by the Government of North Korea, including its unprovoked attack on a South Korean naval ship, nuclear tests, missile launches, human rights abuses, and illicit activities. The national emergency is being extended for another year to ensure the security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States are protected.
