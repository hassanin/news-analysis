The U.S. State Department recently honored women who have shown courage and fought for causes bigger than themselves. These women, although seen as heroes, are also human and desire the same things as everyone else - comfort, happiness, and good times with loved ones. Some have spent their entire lives fighting for their cause, while others have been thrust into it unexpectedly. Regardless, they are all fighting for their own lives and for a better future for everyone. These women are not immune to fear, but they have made the intentional decision to face it and move forward. They have chosen to persist, demand justice, and believe in a brighter future despite the obstacles and fear they face. The article also emphasizes the importance of recognizing our interconnectedness as human beings and how our actions can impact others. Diplomacy is seen as a way to strengthen these connections and promote freedom, education, and justice globally. The author acknowledges the support of her husband and declares that the United States will stand with these courageous women. The article concludes by recommitting to honoring the courage of these women and working towards a brighter future together.
