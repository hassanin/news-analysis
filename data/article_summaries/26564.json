This executive order, issued on May 25, 2018, aims to promote accountability in the federal workforce and ensure the effective functioning of the executive branch. It states that federal employees should be held accountable for their performance and conduct, and that agencies should prioritize performance over length of service when determining which employees to retain. The order also emphasizes that disciplinary action should be tailored to the specific facts and circumstances of each employee's situation. Additionally, it calls for agencies to manage the federal workforce in a way that promotes good morale, employee accountability, and high performance. The order also addresses the negotiation of grievance procedures and the integrity of personnel files. It requires agencies to provide reports on adverse actions taken against employees and their resolutions. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is tasked with examining existing regulations and proposing new ones to align with the principles and requirements outlined in the order. Agencies are required to conform their internal discipline and performance policies to these principles and requirements and renegotiate any collective bargaining agreement provisions that are inconsistent with the order. The OPM Director and the Chief Human Capital Officers Council are also instructed to undertake an initiative to educate federal supervisors about holding employees accountable for performance or misconduct. The order includes general provisions, such as consultation with employee labor representatives and adherence to applicable law and appropriations. It also states that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities.
