At the G-20 Summit in Seoul, leaders reaffirmed their commitment to phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, as agreed upon at the previous summit in Pittsburgh. This move is important for encouraging energy conservation, improving energy security, meeting budget goals, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The leaders also agreed to make the world's physical oil markets more transparent and improve the regulation of financial oil derivative markets, with the aim of reducing oil price volatility. The G-20 countries have made progress in rationalizing and phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies over the past 14 months, with some countries already implementing policy decisions to support this commitment. The International Energy Agency, World Bank, and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development provided a report on progress made, highlighting that fossil fuel consumption subsidies amounted to over $300 billion in 2009. The G-20 leaders requested updates on progress and an assessment of the subsidies' phase-out in advance of the next summit. The United States is committed to phasing out preferential tax incentives for the coal, oil, and gas industries. Additionally, G-20 leaders called for improved reporting on global oil production and consumption, as well as measures to combat market manipulation and enhance market integrity. The United States has implemented reforms through the Dodd-Frank Act to improve transparency and oversight of OTC derivative markets, including financial oil products.
