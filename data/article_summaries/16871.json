The Obama Administration has announced a new initiative to invest in advanced wireless research in the US. Led by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the $400m initiative will deploy four city-scale testing platforms for advanced wireless research over the next decade. These platforms will allow researchers, entrepreneurs and wireless companies to test and develop advanced wireless technology ideas, some of which may translate into key future innovations for 5G and beyond. The initiative aims to accelerate the deployment of wireless networks that are up to 100 times faster than today, enabling breakthrough applications for consumers, smart cities, and the Internet of Things. Private sector companies and associations in the US wireless industry have pledged more than $35m in cash and in-kind support to the design, development, deployment, and ongoing operations of these testing platforms.
