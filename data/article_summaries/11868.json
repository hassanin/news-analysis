President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Missouri and authorized federal aid to assist with recovery efforts after severe storms, straight-line winds, and flooding occurred from August 2-14, 2013. The declaration provides federal funding to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work, facility repairs, and hazard mitigation measures. Michael L. Parker has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
