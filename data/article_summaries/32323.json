During a press briefing, White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders provided updates on various topics. She mentioned that efforts are being made to stabilize and fill a collapsed tunnel at the Hanford nuclear waste site in Washington State, with no indication of worker exposure or radiological release. President Trump is focused on preparations for his upcoming foreign trip and met with the Russian Foreign Minister. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's visit to Moscow was also mentioned. Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price is continuing his listening tour to address the opioid crisis. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is visiting national monument sites in Utah to comply with an executive order for a review of national monument designations. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is delivering a commencement address at Bethune Cookman University. The big news of the day was the termination of FBI Director James Comey. Sanders stated that Trump had lost confidence in Comey, as had the Department of Justice (DOJ), bipartisan members of Congress, and the FBI rank and file. Trump accepted the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to remove Comey from his position. Sanders also mentioned that Comey's missteps and mistakes, as well as his breach of protocol by going around the chain of command, were factors in the decision. Sanders confirmed that the Russia investigation will continue and expressed confidence in Rosenstein's ability to handle it. The press briefing concluded with questions about the selection of Comey's successor and the possible move of the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
