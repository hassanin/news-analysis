The article discusses a series of changes in U.S. policy towards Cuba announced by the Obama administration in 2009. The changes were aimed at reaching out to the Cuban people and supporting their desire for freedom and self-determination. The measures included lifting restrictions on family visits and remittances, promoting greater contact between separated family members in the United States and Cuba, increasing the flow of information and humanitarian resources to the Cuban people, and authorizing greater telecommunications links between the two countries. The article also mentions the importance of Cuban American connections to family in Cuba as a tool for fostering grassroots democracy on the island. The changes were intended to help make a Cuba that respects basic human, political, and economic rights a reality.
