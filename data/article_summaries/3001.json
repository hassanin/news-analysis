President Biden has authorized an increase in federal funding for the Other Needs Assistance â€“ Lost Wages Assistance (ONA-LWA) program in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. This program was established in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Previously, the federal share of funding for ONA-LWA was set at 75%, but the President's order waives the non-federal cost share for the program.
