On September 20, 2018, President Donald Trump issued executive orders relating to foreign policy. These orders were issued under various laws, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act, the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), the Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014 (UFSA), and the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. The orders outline specific actions that should be taken when imposing sanctions on individuals or entities. These actions include prohibiting loans or credits from US financial institutions, blocking property and interests in property, prohibiting transactions in foreign exchange, and prohibiting investments in or purchases of significant amounts of equity or debt instruments. The orders also address actions to be taken by the heads of relevant departments and agencies, such as denying export-related approvals, denying visas, and imposing sanctions on principal executive officers. The orders emphasize the importance of implementing these sanctions effectively and prohibit any transactions or conspiracies that attempt to evade or violate the sanctions. The orders also suspend the entry of sanctioned individuals into the United States and grant the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to take necessary actions to carry out the purposes of the orders.
