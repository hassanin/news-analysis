President Obama expresses his satisfaction with the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank by Members of Congress from both parties. He believes that this step will support American businesses in creating jobs and selling their products globally, without any cost to taxpayers. The Bank had a record-breaking year of financing in 2011, supporting numerous U.S. companies, generating hundreds of thousands of jobs, and bringing the nation closer to the goal of doubling exports by the end of 2014. President Obama had been actively advocating for the Bank's reauthorization, meeting with business leaders and urging Congress to support it. He now calls on Congress to continue their efforts in growing the economy and creating jobs by acting on his proposed ideas. President Obama looks forward to signing the bill into law.
