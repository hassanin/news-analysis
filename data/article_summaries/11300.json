The White House has transmitted the Beijing Treaty on Audiovisual Performances to the Senate for advice and consent to ratification. This treaty, established under the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), aims to promote the protection and enjoyment of creative works. It provides a framework for the rights of performers in motion pictures, television programs, and other audiovisual works. The United States took a leading role in negotiating the treaty, and its provisions align with existing U.S. copyright law. However, some changes in U.S. law will be necessary for implementation. Proposed legislation is being submitted to Congress alongside this transmittal. President Obama recommends that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the treaty and provide its advice and consent to ratification, subject to a declaration as described in the accompanying Department of State report.
