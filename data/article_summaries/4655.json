The Biden-Harris Administration has released visitor logs from January 2021, becoming the first administration to do so for its first full year in office. These logs will be disclosed on a monthly basis and aim to provide transparency and restore trust in government. The released logs cover the period from January 20 to 31, 2021, and include 400 records. However, certain records will be withheld if they involve privacy, national security, or other concerns. The voluntary disclosure policy applies to individuals processed to enter the White House complex and will also include Naval Observatory records related to White House business. Exceptions to the policy will be made based on certain criteria.
