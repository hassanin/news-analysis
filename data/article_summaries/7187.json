The White House will be hosting the 2022 White House Easter Egg Roll on April 18th. First Lady Jill Biden, who was a teacher for over 30 years, came up with the theme for this year's event, "EGGucation!," which will focus on fun educational activities for children. In addition to the traditional egg rolling and hunting, there will be a School House Activity Area, Reading Nook, Talent Show, Field Trip to the Farm, Picture Day, Physical "EGGucation" Zone, and more. Around 30,000 people, including military families and crew members from the U.S.S. DELAWARE, will participate in the event. Tickets were distributed through an online public lottery. The event will be split into five sessions throughout the day. The official social media accounts of the White House, President, and First Lady will provide updates using the hashtags #EasterEggRoll and #EGGucation.
