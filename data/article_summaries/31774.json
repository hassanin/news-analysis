The article discusses President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The author argues that the JCPOA was a flawed agreement that did not address the threats posed by the Iranian regime. The deal lifted economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for improved behavior, but Iran has continued to engage in activities such as enriching uranium, developing ballistic missiles, and supporting terrorism. The author asserts that the way forward is for the United States to work with its allies to find a lasting solution that requires Iran to completely abandon any intention to develop nuclear weapons and cease its support for terrorism and human rights abuses. The decision to withdraw from the JCPOA is seen as part of President Trump's strategy to check Iran's ambition to dominate the Middle East and support the Iranian people rather than the regime. The article also suggests that the decision sets the stage for negotiations with North Korea by demonstrating that actions are rewarded, not empty words.
