Saudi Arabia has made a historic decision to open its airspace for all civilian planes, including those flying to and from Israel. This move is seen as a significant step towards building a more integrated and stable Middle East region. The decision was the result of months of diplomacy between the US Administration and Saudi Arabia. The US President will be the first to fly from Israel to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, marking an important moment. Saudi Arabia's decision is expected to help build momentum towards Israel's further integration into the region, including with Saudi Arabia. The President has pledged to continue advancing this process through direct diplomacy and leader-to-leader engagement.
