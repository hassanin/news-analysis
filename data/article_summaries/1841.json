The Biden administration has announced nearly $300 million in funding for nine bridge projects across the United States. These projects, funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law's Bridge Investment Program, will serve over 230,000 vehicles daily and aim to reduce congestion and improve infrastructure. Vice President Kamala Harris and other senior administration officials will visit various bridge sites to highlight the importance of the investments. The Biden-Harris administration has prioritized rebuilding bridges as part of its Investing in America agenda, with over 4,600 bridge repair and replacement projects already in progress. This funding is part of the larger effort to address the more than 43,000 bridges in poor condition across the country. The administration's investment in infrastructure has already led to significant job creation and private sector manufacturing investments.
