The author recalls visiting survivors in the hospital after the attack and being inspired by their resilience and bravery. Despite efforts to address gun violence, the problem persists in the country.

However, the author emphasizes the need for Congressional action, particularly for universal background checks legislation, and urges Republicans in Congress to support common-sense measures that have broad public backing. The author expresses prayers for the survivors and those who still mourn the loss of their loved ones.
