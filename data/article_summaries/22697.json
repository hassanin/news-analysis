Tom Daschle has requested to withdraw his nomination for Secretary of Health and Human Services. President Obama accepts his decision with sadness and regret, acknowledging Daschle's dedication to public service and health care reform. Daschle admits his mistake and believes that the work of health care reform requires a leader who can operate without distraction. He wants Congress to focus on the President's economic agenda, including affordable health care for all Americans. Daschle remains a fervent supporter of health system reform but will not be the architect of it.
