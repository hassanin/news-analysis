The United States welcomes Saudi Arabia's statement exposing Iran's support for Houthi militias, including the supply of illegal arms like ballistic missiles. The US condemns Iran's activities and stands with Saudi Arabia and its Gulf partners against Iran's aggression and violations of international law. The US calls on the United Nations to examine evidence that Iran is perpetuating the war in Yemen for its own regional ambitions. The US also calls on all nations to hold Iran accountable for violating UN Security Council resolutions that ban arms transfers to the Houthis. Houthi missile attacks, enabled by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, threaten regional security and undermine UN efforts for a negotiated end to the conflict. The US seeks a negotiated settlement and the provision of humanitarian assistance to Yemen. The US will work with like-minded partners to respond to these attacks and expose Iran's destabilizing activities in the region.
