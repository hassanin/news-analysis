President Biden announced in a speech in the Rose Garden that his administration has brought together Democrats, Republicans, and the private sector to lower high-speed internet costs for millions of Americans. He highlighted the importance of affordable and accessible internet, particularly during the pandemic, where it played a critical role in areas such as education, healthcare, remote work, and small businesses. The Affordable Connectivity Program, created as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, provides a $30 credit per month towards internet bills for eligible households. The program has secured commitments from major internet providers, such as AT&T, Comcast, Frontier, Spectrum, and Verizon, to lower prices and improve speeds for eligible households. The President also emphasized the need to promote competition in the internet market and expand high-speed internet infrastructure to all parts of the country. He urged eligible households to take advantage of the program and reduce their internet costs. The President thanked the companies and organizations involved in delivering affordable internet and expressed his commitment to fighting inflation and lowering costs for American families.
