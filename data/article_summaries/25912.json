The article discusses how Brett Kavanaugh's view on independent counsels is unrelated to Robert Mueller's probe. Kavanaugh, who is President Trump's Supreme Court nominee, has expressed his dislike for independent counsels and has stated that he wants to challenge their constitutionality. However, legal experts argue that Kavanaugh's view on independent counsels does not necessarily mean he would declare Mueller's investigation unconstitutional. The experts point out that special counsels, like Mueller, operate differently from independent counsels, and that Kavanaugh's stance on one does not automatically translate to the other. The article emphasizes the need for lawmakers to understand these differences before assuming Kavanaugh's position on Mueller's investigation.
