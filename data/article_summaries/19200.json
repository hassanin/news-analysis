President Obama has directed the establishment of a Quadrennial Energy Review Task Force to develop an integrated review of energy policy in the United States. The initial focus of the review will be on the nation's energy infrastructure. The Task Force will include representatives from various executive departments and agencies and will gather input from stakeholders such as state and local governments, businesses, universities, and non-governmental organizations. The Task Force will submit a Quadrennial Energy Review Report every four years, starting in 2015, which will provide recommendations for federal energy policy. The report will address economic, environmental, security, and health and safety priorities. The Task Force will also assess research and development programs and identify analytical tools and data needed for further policy development. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of collaboration between the federal government and the private sector in developing and implementing effective energy policies.
