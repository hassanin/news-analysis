In this article, President Barack Obama announces changes to make it easier for veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) to receive the benefits they need. For many years, veterans with PTSD have faced difficulties in receiving benefits because they were required to provide evidence that the PTSD was caused by a specific event. The Department of Veterans Affairs, led by Secretary Shinseki, will now streamline the process to help veterans with PTSD receive the necessary benefits. This change will not only benefit veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq but also generations of veterans who have served and made sacrifices for the country. The President emphasizes the importance of honoring and supporting the men and women of the armed forces and their families, both during their active service and after they return home. The government is committed to providing the necessary care and benefits to veterans, including medical care, education, and housing assistance. The article also highlights the prevalence of PTSD and traumatic brain injuries among soldiers and the importance of providing them with the necessary support. The President concludes by affirming the government's commitment to supporting veterans and ensuring that they receive the help they need.
