President of the United States has announced that the country will donate 80 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to other countries. This includes 60 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine that were previously announced, as well as at least 20 million additional doses of vaccines authorized in the U.S. by the end of June. The U.S. will continue to donate excess vaccine supply as it becomes available. The goal of this effort is to coordinate a multilateral response to end the pandemic, working with G7 partners, the European Union, COVAX, and others. The aim is to secure commitments from other governments and private sector partners to provide more vaccines, increase production and manufacturing, and ensure widespread vaccination to save lives, stop the spread of COVID-19, and recover economically. This decision reflects the U.S.'s commitment to global COVID-19 response and leadership in ending the pandemic.
