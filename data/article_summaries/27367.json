According to an article from The Wall Street Journal, the number of job openings in the US exceeded the number of job seekers for the first time since record-keeping began in 2000. The Labor Department reported that there were 6.7 million job openings at the end of April, surpassing the 6.3 million unemployed Americans. This indicates a historically tight labor market, with a jobless rate of 3.8%, the lowest since April 2000. The article also highlights that this trend is providing opportunities for individuals who have struggled to find stable employment in recent years. Hourly pay for nonsupervisors rose 2.8% in May, the best annual gain since mid-2009.
