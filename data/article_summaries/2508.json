President Biden signed an executive order two years ago to reestablish the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. The office's mission is to collaborate with faith-based and community organizations to serve people in need. The Partnerships Office works with agency Centers for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships at various departments and organizations to address shared priorities such as religious freedom, expanding opportunity, responding to disasters, mental health and substance use problems, maternal and child health, hunger and nutrition, refugee support, environmental protection, and COVID-19 recovery. The administration has made achievements in these areas to promote the stated priorities.
