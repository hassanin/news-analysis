President Obama expressed his gratitude to Dr. Ed Montgomery for his dedicated service to the Administration and the country. Dr. Montgomery played a crucial role in the economic recovery efforts, particularly in assisting those affected by the auto industry's struggles. The results of his efforts have been evident in various auto towns across America, including the reactivation of factories ahead of schedule and the retraining of workers for jobs in emerging industries. Although Dr. Montgomery will be missed, the Administration's commitment to auto workers and communities remains strong. The White House Council on Auto Communities will continue its work under the guidance of Secretary Solis and NEC Director Larry Summers. The search for a replacement for Dr. Montgomery will be initiated promptly. Additionally, it was announced that Dr. Montgomery will assume the role of dean of public policy at Georgetown University, starting on August 15.
