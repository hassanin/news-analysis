President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation declaring May 15, 2017, as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 14 through May 20, 2017, as Police Week. The proclamation honors the men and women of law enforcement who have been killed or disabled while serving their communities. It highlights the sacrifices made by police officers and the need to support them in their efforts to protect and serve. The proclamation also emphasizes the importance of preventing and prosecuting crimes of violence against law enforcement officers. The President calls on Americans to observe Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and encourages the flag to be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day. Melania and Donald Trump will light the White House in blue on May 15 as a symbol of appreciation for law enforcement officers.
