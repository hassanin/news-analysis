The article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Donald J. Trump on October 18, 2019. The memorandum discusses the determination of the United States with respect to the efforts of foreign governments regarding trafficking in persons. It states that the United States will not provide nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related assistance to certain governments, including Burundi, China, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, The Gambia, Iran, and Mauritania, until they comply with the minimum standards of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act or make significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance. The memorandum also mentions restrictions on assistance and funding for educational and cultural exchange programs for the governments of Cuba, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Russia, and Syria. Additionally, the memorandum instructs the United States Executive Directors of multilateral development banks to vote against any loan or utilization of funds for certain governments until they comply with the Act's minimum standards. The memorandum includes several partial waivers for certain countries, such as allowing assistance for programs related to the Ebola virus disease and for meeting the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking in persons. The determination, certification, and memorandum of justification are to be submitted to Congress and published in the Federal Register.
