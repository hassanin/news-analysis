President Barack Obama has sent a letter to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Burma will continue beyond May 20, 2013. Despite the progress made by the Burmese government in areas such as releasing political prisoners and achieving cease-fire talks, the situation in the country still poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Concerns remain about political prisoners, ongoing conflict and human rights abuses in ethnic minority areas, and Burma's military relationship with North Korea. The United States is committed to supporting and strengthening Burma's reform efforts to ensure a successful democratic transition.
