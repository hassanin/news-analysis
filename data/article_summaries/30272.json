President Trump has prioritized ocean exploration during his administration, directing the Federal government to map, explore, and characterize the United States Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The EEZ is one of the largest in the world, but only 40 percent of it has been mapped. Seafloor maps and exploration data are important for various activities such as maritime navigation, offshore energy, fish habitat identification, national security infrastructure protection, and pharmaceutical research. The Council on Environmental Quality and the Office of Science and Technology Policy have been working with partners to accelerate ocean exploration. They have released a National Strategy and Recommendations to map the EEZ by 2030 and 2040 respectively. The strategy calls for collaboration between Federal agencies, non-Federal partners, and various sectors to build a national enterprise for ocean mapping. The goal is to enhance economic competitiveness, strengthen national security, protect the environment, and promote prosperity. Partnerships with the private sector, academia, and non-governmental organizations have been established to develop and employ ocean science and technology. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has formed partnerships to gather data for ocean mapping, including data from private-sector partner Caladan Oceanic's exploration of the Mariana Trench. The Council on Environmental Quality continues to work with Federal partners to implement the National Strategy and collaborate with ocean partners. The comprehensive understanding of the EEZ is a national goal that requires a collective effort.
