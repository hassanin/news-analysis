The RESTRICT Act, introduced by a bipartisan group of Senators led by Senators Warner and Thune, aims to empower the US government to prevent foreign governments from exploiting technology services operating in the US, which could pose risks to Americans' sensitive data and national security. The bill provides a systematic framework for addressing technology-based threats and gives the US government new mechanisms to mitigate national security risks posed by high-risk technology businesses. It also strengthens the ability to address risks posed by individual transactions and certain classes of transactions involving countries of concern in sensitive technology sectors. There is a call for Congress to act quickly on this bill and send it to the President's desk.
