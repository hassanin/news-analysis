Vice President Mike Pence and Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State of the Holy See, spoke about their concerns regarding the political crisis in Nicaragua. Pence praised the Catholic Church's leadership and the Pope's calls for mediation and national dialogue. He also recognized the sacrifices made by the church's clergy in Nicaragua to protect human rights, defend religious freedom, and promote negotiations. Both leaders condemned the violence in Nicaragua, which has resulted in numerous deaths and increasingly targeted the Church. They reiterated their support for the Nicaraguan Episcopal Conference and the faith community for standing up for human rights, democracy, and freedom.
