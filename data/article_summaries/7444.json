In recognition of National Family Caregivers Month, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. acknowledges the love and sacrifice of over 50 million Americans who provide vital care and medical assistance to their loved ones. Many individuals find themselves juggling the responsibilities of supporting aging parents, raising children, and earning a living. Others care for family members with disabilities or support wounded veterans. The burden falls particularly hard on those who cannot afford support, including women, people of color, and immigrants. These caregivers often leave good jobs to provide care, and their work is undervalued and unpaid. The Biden Administration is committed to easing the financial strain on working families and providing caregivers with the resources and respect they deserve. The Department of Health and Human Services has outlined numerous actions to support family caregivers' health, well-being, and financial security. The American Rescue Plan allocated $145 million to the National Family Caregiver Support Program, providing counseling, training, and short-term relief to caregivers. The Department of Veterans Affairs' Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers has been expanded to offer greater financial and mental health support to veteran caregivers. The "Hidden Helpers" initiative was also launched to assist the 2.3 million children living with disabled veterans. Additionally, efforts are being made to lower child and elder care costs and establish paid family and medical leave. President Biden emphasizes that family caregivers are essential to the nation's long-term care system and should be recognized and supported in their own lives. In light of this, November 2022 is proclaimed as National Family Caregivers Month, and Americans are encouraged to reach out and express gratitude to those who provide care to those in need.
