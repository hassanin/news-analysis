The Obama Administration has launched a pilot initiative called Strong Cities, Strong Communities (SC2) to strengthen local capacity and stimulate economic growth in six cities: Chester, PA; Cleveland, OH; Detroit, MI; Fresno, CA; Memphis, TN; and New Orleans, LA. Federal agencies will provide experienced staff to work directly with these cities to leverage federal dollars and support local efforts in economic growth and community development. The initiative also includes a grant competition for comprehensive economic planning assistance, allowing communities nationwide to compete and spark local innovation. SC2 aims to improve the way the federal government does business, provide on-the-ground assistance and support tailored to local needs, and develop critical partnerships with local stakeholders. The initiative consists of four components: SC2 Community Solutions Teams, SC2 Fellowship Program, SC2 Economic Planning Challenge, and the National Resource Network. The pilot cities were selected based on economic need, strong local leadership and collaboration, potential for economic growth, geographic diversity, and the ability to test the SC2 model.
