The Office of National Drug Control Policy has released estimates showing that Bolivia remains the third largest producer of cocaine in the world. In 2018, coca cultivation in Bolivia increased by 6 percent to 32,900 hectares, resulting in a 2 percent increase in cocaine production potential to 254 metric tons. The Yungas region is the largest coca cultivation area in Bolivia, followed by the Carrasco and Chapare regions. The cultivation is 50 percent over the limit set by the Bolivian government. In the United States, the number of current cocaine users is 1.9 million, a 27 percent increase since 2014. However, the survey also shows a decrease in the number of Americans initiating cocaine use in the past year. Cocaine-involved overdose deaths in the US rose by 174 percent from 2014 to 2018.
