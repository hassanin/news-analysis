President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the Karuk Tribe, providing federal aid to support their efforts in addressing the damage caused by a wildfire that occurred between July 29 and August 2, 2013. The declaration allows for federal funding to be used for emergency work, facility repairs or replacements, and hazard mitigation measures. Stephen M. DeBlasio Sr. has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
