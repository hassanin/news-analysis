President Trump delivered a speech in Indianapolis, Indiana, outlining his plan for tax reform. He emphasized the need for tax cuts, simplification of the tax code, and bringing back jobs and wealth to the United States. The President proposed reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent, eliminating the estate tax, and allowing companies to fully write off the cost of equipment in the year of purchase. He also called for a one-time low tax on repatriated funds held overseas. The President urged Democrats and Republicans to come together to pass the tax reform plan and asked the American people to voice their support to their representatives.
