This article is about executive orders related to healthcare issued by President Donald Trump on June 24, 2019. The purpose of these orders is to enhance the ability of patients to choose healthcare that is best for them by increasing price and quality transparency. The orders aim to provide patients with access to information about the price and quality of healthcare services in advance, allowing them to make fully informed decisions. The orders also seek to protect patients from surprise billing and to increase competition, innovation, and value in the healthcare system. Specific policies outlined in the orders include requiring hospitals to publicly post standard charge information, soliciting comments on providing information about expected out-of-pocket costs, and developing a Health Quality Roadmap. The orders also aim to increase access to de-identified claims data for researchers and entrepreneurs and to empower patients by enhancing control over their healthcare resources. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is directed to submit a report on additional steps to address surprise medical billing. The orders are to be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
