President Donald J. Trump will award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Devin Nunes, recognizing his meritorious contributions to the security and national interests of the United States. Nunes has been a strong advocate for California farmers and played a key role in bringing water to the Central Valley. As Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he investigated Russian aggression and opposed the Iran Nuclear Deal. Nunes also uncovered the funding of the infamous Steele Dossier by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. He discovered that the Obama-Biden administration had issued FISA warrants to spy on President Trump's campaign and revealed the vindictive persecution of General Michael Flynn. Nunes faced personal attacks and a frivolous ethics investigation, but his courage and pursuit of the truth exposed the greatest scandal in American history.
