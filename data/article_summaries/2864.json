The President has proposed a historic economic growth framework that addresses various important issues for American families. This framework includes the largest investment in tackling the climate crisis in history, reducing the cost of child care for middle-class families, implementing universal pre-K, and making progress in lowering healthcare costs. The framework has received widespread support from organized labor, civil rights groups, business, and the climate community, as well as from Democrats in Congress. Legislative text is being made public, and the path to passing both the Build Back Better Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal is becoming clearer.
