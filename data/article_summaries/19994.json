President Barack Obama has published a notice stating that the national emergency with respect to Belarus will continue beyond June 16, 2011. This decision comes as a result of the flawed December 2010 Presidential election in Belarus and the subsequent violence against peaceful demonstrators, detention of opposition candidates, repression of independent media, and violations of human rights. The actions and policies of the Government of Belarus and others pose an ongoing threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the President has determined it necessary to continue the national emergency and the related measures blocking the property of certain individuals.
