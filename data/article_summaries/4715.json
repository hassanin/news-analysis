The Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, held a meeting with business leaders to discuss investment in Central America. The goal is to address the root causes of migration from the region by creating economic opportunities and improving living conditions. In the past six months, the initiative has gained support from 77 partners, with commitments totaling over $1.2 billion. The private sector's investment will have a direct impact on job creation, financial inclusion, good governance, and the rule of law. Various companies, including Nespresso, Microsoft, MasterCard, PepsiCo, and Parkdale Mills, have pledged to invest in the region. Additionally, humanitarian agencies like CARE will establish centers focused on gender equity. The United States government has also provided vaccines and humanitarian assistance, engaged in diplomatic efforts, and collaborated with Mexico and other countries to address the root causes of migration. The Vice President emphasized the importance of partnership and expressed optimism about the impact of the initiative.
