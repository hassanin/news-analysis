The White House has launched the "Healthy Communities Challenge" to engage communities with large numbers of uninsured individuals. The goal is to help these communities reach the remaining 10.5 million uninsured Americans eligible for Marketplace coverage. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will compare the number of new Marketplace signups in participating communities to the HHS estimates of eligible uninsured individuals to determine which communities have made the most progress. The winning community will receive recognition, a healthier community, and a visit from President Obama. Denver is one of the 20 communities participating in the challenge. In Colorado, the uninsured rate dropped from 17% in 2013 to 10.6% in the first half of 2015. However, there are still 170,000 uninsured individuals eligible for the Marketplace in the Denver region.
