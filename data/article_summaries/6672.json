The Biden-Harris Administration convened a meeting with over 40 members of the National Alliance of Latino Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) to discuss President Biden's agenda for economic prosperity and equity for Latino communities. The meeting focused on the Investing in America agenda and the American Rescue Plan, which includes efforts to reduce barriers for Latino businesses to receive federal funding, provide services to support rural communities, increase capital investment, and secure training for CDFIs. Administration officials emphasized their equity action plans and the need to prioritize communities that have been historically left behind. The meeting concluded with a commitment to continued collaboration to best serve Latino communities.
