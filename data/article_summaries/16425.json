On December 29, 2009, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13526, titled "Classified National Security Information." This order designates certain officials who have the authority to classify information as "Top Secret" or "Secret." The officials include those from the Executive Office of the President, such as the Chief of Staff, National Security Advisor, and Director of National Drug Control Policy, as well as officials from various departments and agencies, including the Secretaries of State, Treasury, Defense, and Energy, among others. The order also specifies that certain officials, such as the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, may not delegate their classification authority. If an agency head without original classification authority has a need to classify information, they must refer the matter to an agency head with appropriate subject matter interest and classification authority. Presidential designations made prior to the issuance of this order are revoked, but delegations of authority made in accordance with previous orders shall continue in effect, provided they are delegable under this order. The order will be published in the Federal Register.
