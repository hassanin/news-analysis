President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation recognizing National School Lunch Week, which highlights the importance of school lunch programs in promoting the health and well-being of children. The National School Lunch Program, a partnership between federal, state, and local governments, has been providing low-cost or free meals to millions of students for over 70 years. The program serves more than 31 million students every school day across the country. School lunches not only provide balanced nutrition but also teach students the relationship between nutrition and academic performance. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to support and promote awareness of the health and well-being of our nation's children.
