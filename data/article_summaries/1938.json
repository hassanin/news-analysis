President Biden has signed an Executive Order to launch a National Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Initiative in the United States. The initiative aims to create jobs, strengthen supply chains, and lower prices for American families. The White House will host a summit to announce new investments and resources related to biotechnology and biomanufacturing. The United States is looking to harness the potential of biotechnology to compete with other countries in the global industry. The reliance on foreign materials and bioproduction threatens the country's access to critical resources. By utilizing biotechnology and biomanufacturing, the United States can create a bioeconomy that produces various products such as medicines, fuels, and plastics. Biomanufacturing, which involves programming microbes to produce specialty chemicals and compounds, is seen as an alternative to petrochemical-based production. The initiative will accelerate biotechnology innovation in sectors like health, agriculture, and energy, and create well-paying jobs across America. It will also improve food and energy security, drive agricultural innovation, and contribute to advancements in medicine.
