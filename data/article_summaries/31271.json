President Donald Trump has signed into law the "PROGRESS for Indian Tribes Act of 2019," which makes amendments to enhance tribal self-governance under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975. The Act promotes the administration's goal of empowering tribes by providing greater control and decision-making authority over federal funds used for tribal transportation programs. However, the Act includes provisions that raise constitutional concerns. One provision prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from reducing funding except as required by a congressional directive in legislation or an accompanying report. The President argues that considering such reports as mandatory would unconstitutionally delegate lawmaking authority. Another provision applies a rule of interpretation to all federal laws and executive orders, which the President believes cannot amend or change the meaning of executive orders. Lastly, a provision seeks to negate the application of any law or regulation pertaining to federal procurement to construction programs under the Act. The President interprets this provision as changing the governing law but not rescinding or withdrawing any executive orders.
