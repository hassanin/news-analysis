This executive order, issued on May 19, 2020, addresses the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. It directs federal agencies to take action to promote economic recovery by rescinding, modifying, waiving, or exempting regulations and requirements that may hinder economic growth. The order also encourages agencies to provide guidance to businesses, particularly small businesses, on compliance with regulations and commit to fairness in enforcement. It further instructs agencies to use emergency authorities and non-regulatory actions to support economic response efforts. The order emphasizes the importance of fairness in administrative enforcement and adjudication, outlining principles that agencies should consider in their procedures and practices. Additionally, it calls for a review of regulatory standards that have been temporarily rescinded or modified during the pandemic to determine which actions could promote economic recovery if made permanent. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is responsible for monitoring compliance with the order and may issue guidance for its implementation.
