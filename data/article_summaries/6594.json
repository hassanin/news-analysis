In honor of National Foster Care Month, President Biden recognizes the courage of children and youth in foster care who face challenges that no child should have to endure. He expresses gratitude to kinship and foster parents who provide care, as well as to biological parents and families who work to safely reunite with their children. The article highlights the need to support volunteers and professionals who help foster youth find temporary and permanent homes. It also acknowledges the uphill battle that children in foster care face in achieving their full potential, particularly children of color and those who identify as LGBTQI+. 

The Biden administration is investing in community-based child abuse and neglect prevention programs and seeking to expand evidence-based foster care prevention services. Efforts are being made to prevent unnecessary removal of children from their families due to poverty, including fighting for the expanded Child Tax Credit. The administration is also working to place more children with relatives and trusted adults instead of group homes and providing legal representation to biological parents navigating the child welfare system. 

To make adoption and legal guardianship more accessible, President Biden proposes making the adoption tax credit fully refundable and extending it to legal guardians. The administration is also focused on removing barriers and biases that make it harder for LGBTQI+ families to foster and adopt. Support is being provided to youth aging out of the foster care system, including housing vouchers, job training programs, and access to higher education and healthcare. 

President Biden recognizes the positive impact of foster care and emphasizes the importance of ensuring children are placed in loving and supportive environments. He calls on all Americans to observe National Foster Care Month by reaching out to children and youth in foster care, those at risk of entering foster care, and kin families and caregivers. The goal is to provide the necessary tools, resources, and support for a meaningful life.
