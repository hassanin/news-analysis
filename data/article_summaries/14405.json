The White House acknowledges the efforts made by Turkey and Brazil regarding Iran's nuclear program. However, the proposal announced in Tehran must be conveyed clearly and authoritatively to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) before it can be considered by the international community. The United States and the international community have serious concerns about Iran's repeated failure to live up to its commitments and the need to address fundamental issues related to its nuclear program. Iran's decision to continue its 20% enrichment is a direct violation of UN Security Council resolutions. The Joint Declaration issued in Tehran is vague about Iran's willingness to meet with the P5+1 countries to address international concerns. The United States will continue working with international partners and the UN Security Council to make it clear that Iran must demonstrate its willingness to comply with international obligations or face consequences, including sanctions. Iran needs to assure the international community that its nuclear program is intended exclusively for peaceful purposes by complying with UN Security Council resolutions and cooperating fully with the IAEA. The United States remains committed to a diplomatic solution and will consult closely with partners on these developments.
