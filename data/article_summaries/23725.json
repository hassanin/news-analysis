President Obama has outlined a plan to make college more affordable and combat rising college costs. The plan includes measures to measure college performance through a new ratings system, tie financial aid to college performance, promote innovation and competition, and ensure that student debt remains affordable. The plan aims to provide students and families with information to select schools that provide the best value, encourage colleges to offer more affordable options, and help student borrowers struggling with existing debt. The plan also includes initiatives to promote innovation and competition in higher education and empower students with information. Additionally, the plan aims to ensure that student debt is manageable by allowing borrowers to cap their federal student loan payments at 10 percent of their monthly income and expanding access to income-driven repayment plans. The plan also includes efforts to educate borrowers about repayment options and provide resources for selecting the right repayment option.
