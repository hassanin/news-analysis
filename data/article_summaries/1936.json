The United States strongly condemns Iran's cyberattack on Albania and supports Prime Minister Rama's call for Iran to be held accountable. The US will take further action to ensure Iran is held responsible for actions that threaten the security of a US ally and set a troubling precedent in cyberspace. The US government has been working with private sector partners to support Albania in mitigating and recovering from the cyberattack that destroyed government data and disrupted services. It has been concluded that the Government of Iran conducted the cyberattack and subsequent hack and leak operations. Iran's actions disregard norms of responsible peacetime behavior in cyberspace, which includes refraining from damaging critical infrastructure. Albania views its impacted government networks as critical infrastructure. Malicious cyber activity that intentionally damages critical infrastructure can have cascading effects and pose a risk of harm to the population, potentially leading to escalation and conflict. The US will continue to support Albania in its efforts and invites partners and allies to join in holding malicious cyber actors accountable and building a secure digital future.
