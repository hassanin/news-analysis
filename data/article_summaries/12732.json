In this press briefing, Press Secretary Jay Carney and Deputy Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese discuss the President's call on Congress to pass measures to crack down on illegal activity and manipulation in the oil markets. Deese outlines the details of the proposed measures, which include increased resources to the CFTC for oversight and enforcement, additional authorities for the CFTC to set margin requirements, new civil and criminal penalties for illegal market manipulation, and expanded access to trader data. The goal is to strengthen oversight of energy markets and give consumers confidence that price changes are not being driven by illegal activity. The President believes that these measures, along with an all-of-the-above energy strategy, are necessary to address the challenges of energy markets. The briefing also covers other topics such as the Secret Service scandal, Afghanistan, LGBT discrimination, and Syria.
