President Barack Obama has proclaimed July 27 through August 2, 2014, as Minority Enterprise Development Week. This week is dedicated to celebrating the essential role that minority entrepreneurs play in the economy and communities of the United States. Minority-owned businesses employ millions of Americans, and the Obama Administration has been committed to investing in their success. The administration has increased access to contracts and capital, reduced paperwork, and connected minority enterprises to export markets. They have also provided loans to small business owners and offered resources and workshops to help minority entrepreneurs grow their businesses. The proclamation highlights the importance of diversity and giving all entrepreneurs a chance to compete, stating that when small businesses thrive, new opportunities will open up and benefit both individuals and the nation as a whole.
