President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed May 1 through May 7, 2022, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week in the United States. The proclamation aims to raise awareness about the threat posed by hurricanes and to improve the nation's resilience to these powerful storms. The frequency and intensity of hurricanes, typhoons, and tropical storms have increased in recent years, causing significant destruction across the country. The 2021 hurricane season was particularly active and costly, with hurricanes Ida and Henri causing severe weather and flooding in several states. These storms have devastating effects on infrastructure, economies, and communities, especially low-income and communities of color. President Biden's administration is committed to recovering and rebuilding after climate-related events and strengthening the resiliency of infrastructure and communities. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and proposed investments in climate resilience programs aim to enhance coastal resilience, improve weather forecasting and communication, and make communities more resilient to flooding. The government also emphasizes the importance of individual and family preparedness, including staying informed, updating insurance policies, and having emergency kits and plans ready. The Federal Emergency Management Agency's Ready.gov website provides more information on hurricane preparedness. President Biden calls for collective action to save lives, reduce damage, and recover more quickly from hurricanes and tropical storms. The proclamation urges all Americans and government agencies to contribute to building a climate-resilient nation and sharing information to protect lives and property.
