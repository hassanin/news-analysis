On April 15, 2009, the White House announced that Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden had released their 2008 income tax returns. They filed jointly and reported an adjusted gross income of $269,256, with an after-tax income of $183,315. Their primary sources of income were salaries from the United States Senate, Widener University, Delaware Technical & Community College, and royalties from the audio rights to the Vice President's book. The Bidens paid $46,952 in federal income taxes, $11,164 in Delaware state income taxes, and donated $1,885 to charity. It is noted that the charitable donations claimed on their tax returns do not represent the sum of their annual contributions, as they also donate their time and resources to their church and other causes. Copies of their tax returns are available for download.
