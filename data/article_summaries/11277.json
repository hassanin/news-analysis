The President has signed a Presidential Determination to waive certain restrictions under the Arms Export Control Act. This will allow the US Government to provide non-lethal assistance to Syria. The assistance includes chemical weapons-related personal protective equipment to international organizations, life-saving assistance for Syrian health care providers, and defensive training and equipment to select members of the Syrian opposition. This action is part of ongoing efforts to provide assistance to those in need in Syria.
