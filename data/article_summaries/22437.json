On January 30, 2009, President Obama declared a federal emergency in the state of Missouri due to a severe winter storm that began on January 26. The declaration authorized the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate disaster relief efforts and provide assistance to alleviate the impact of the emergency. FEMA is authorized to mobilize equipment and resources to help the affected areas. Emergency protective measures will be provided with 75 percent federal funding. Thomas A. Hall was named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. For more information, contact FEMA.
