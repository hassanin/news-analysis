President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has declared in a notice sent to the Federal Register that the national emergency with respect to Hong Kong, which was declared in Executive Order 13936 on July 14, 2020, will continue beyond July 14, 2023. The President cited recent actions by the People's Republic of China that undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and pose a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. As a result, President Biden has determined that it is necessary to maintain the national emergency declaration.
