President Trump delivered remarks at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, highlighting his administration's efforts to reduce drug prices and bring down the cost of prescription drugs. He emphasized the unfair practice of other countries charging lower prices for the same drugs and how American consumers end up subsidizing those lower prices. The President announced a plan to allow Medicare to determine drug prices based on the prices paid by other nations, in an effort to hold drug companies and foreign countries accountable for their practices. He also mentioned the need to fix the broken payment system for doctors and protect Medicare for seniors. The President expressed hope for bipartisan support on these issues and reiterated his commitment to putting America first.
