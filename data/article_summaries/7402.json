The Biden-Harris Administration will be hosting the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health on September 28, 2022, in Washington, DC. This conference will be the first of its kind in over 50 years. The aim of the conference is to address the issues of food insecurity and diet-related diseases, such as heart disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes, which are leading causes of death and disability in the United States. Lack of access to healthy and affordable foods is one of the factors contributing to these problems, and the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the situation. The conference will bring together government leaders, academics, activists, and Americans from all walks of life to work towards the goal of ending hunger and reducing diet-related diseases in the US by 2030, while also addressing disparities among affected communities. At the conference, a national strategy will be announced, outlining the actions the government will take to drive transformative change and address the intersections between food, hunger, nutrition, and health.
