On November 14, 1979, President Trump declared a national emergency with respect to Iran due to the threat it posed to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The emergency has not been resolved, and the agreements with Iran are still being implemented. Therefore, President Trump has decided to continue the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This declaration is separate from the emergency declared in 1995 and is distinct from the emergency renewal in March 2019. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
