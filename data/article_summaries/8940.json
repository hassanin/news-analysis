The United States strongly condemns North Korea's recent launch using ballistic missile technology, which violates multiple UN Security Council resolutions and increases tensions in the region. The launch is seen as a threat to security and could destabilize the situation in the area and beyond. The US President and national security team are assessing the situation and working closely with allies and partners. They urge all countries to condemn the launch and call on North Korea to engage in serious negotiations. While diplomacy remains an option, North Korea must immediately stop its provocative actions and choose engagement. The US is committed to ensuring the security of its own homeland, as well as its allies in South Korea and Japan, and will take necessary measures to do so.
