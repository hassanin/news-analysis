Karen Pence, the Second Lady of the United States, recently spoke at the Creative Forces Arts and Military Conference in Texas, highlighting the value of arts therapies in healing the invisible wounds of war. The Creative Forces: NEA Military Healing Arts Network connects clinics and installations with local communities to develop arts programs for military personnel, veterans, and families. Pence also visited Fort Hood, where she met with art and music therapists. She learned about the power of art therapy through examples such as a memory box created by a service member to honor fallen friends, and a mask that represented the complexities of daily life in the military. Music therapy was also discussed, with a story of a service member overcoming PTSD and chronic pain through individual drum lessons and eventually performing on stage. Pence emphasized the importance of art therapy for military spouses and other family members, and expressed her dedication to promoting art therapy through her initiative, Art Therapy: Healing with the HeART.
