President Donald Trump has signed an executive order declaring a national emergency to address the United States' dependence on critical minerals from foreign adversaries. The order states that a strong America cannot rely on imports from foreign adversaries for minerals necessary for economic and military strength. The order directs the Secretary of the Interior to investigate the country's reliance on critical minerals from foreign adversaries and submit a report with recommendations for executive action. It also emphasizes the need to enhance domestic mining and processing capacity to reduce vulnerability to supply disruptions and to promote responsible mining practices. The order calls for the development of secure critical minerals supply chains that do not depend on resources from foreign adversaries and the establishment of domestically competitive mining and processing capabilities. The order also directs relevant agencies to prioritize the expansion and protection of the domestic supply chain for minerals and to use available authorities to accelerate permits and project completion. The Secretary of Energy is instructed to develop guidance clarifying the eligibility of projects supporting domestic supply chains for minerals for loan guarantees and funding awards. The order also amends a previous executive order to update the list of critical minerals periodically.
