The new United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) is receiving positive reviews. The trade deal includes increased labor protections, higher standards for duty-free auto shipments, increased access to the Canadian dairy market for US farmers, and changes to the dispute-resolution system. The agreement has been praised by American farmers, who believe it delivers on President Trump's promise to support rural America. Canada made concessions in the dairy industry, which is seen as a victory for American farmers. Labor officials are also pleased with the agreement, as it includes provisions pushing Mexico to strengthen its unions. The USMCA is seen as a win for Trump, who has delivered on another campaign promise. The deal will increase US access to Canadian markets and center the car industry in North America. It is also seen as a practical move to address competition with China. The new NAFTA, now called USMCA, has secured advantages for the US and demonstrates the Trump administration's ability to negotiate better trade pacts.
