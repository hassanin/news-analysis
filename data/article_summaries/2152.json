President Joe Biden will be making a historic visit to Papua New Guinea during his trip from the G7 Leaders' Summit in Japan to the Quad Leaders' Summit in Australia later this month. During his time in Papua New Guinea, President Biden will meet with Prime Minister Marape and other leaders from the Pacific Island Forum to discuss important topics such as combating climate change, protecting maritime resources, and promoting inclusive economic growth. This visit is significant as it marks the first time a sitting U.S. President has visited a Pacific Island country, highlighting the importance of the partnership between the United States and the Pacific Islands.
