The White House has announced a new initiative called the APEC Travel Facilitation Initiative, aimed at making travel across the Asia-Pacific region easier, faster, and more secure. President Obama signed legislation allowing the issuance of the APEC Business Travel Card (ABTC) to eligible U.S. travelers. This card will expedite travel for qualified American travelers in the Asia-Pacific region by providing expedited scheduling of visa interviews and access to fast-track immigration lanes at airports in APEC economies. The United States is also making progress on bilateral Trusted Traveler cooperation arrangements with the Republic of Korea and Singapore, which will allow eligible, pre-screened citizens to clear immigration and customs expeditiously using automated kiosks when traveling between these countries and the United States. The APEC Travel Facilitation Initiative aims to improve passenger security screening on departure and immigration and customs processing on arrival, promote best practices, and explore "next generation" approaches to make travel faster, easier, and more secure. These efforts reflect the economic importance of travel in the Asia-Pacific region, which is projected to see a significant increase in traveler volume in the coming years.
