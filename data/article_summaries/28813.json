Second Lady Karen Pence visited the Children's Health Music Therapy Program at Children's Medical Center in Dallas and The Art Station in Fort Worth. The Art Station is a community-based nonprofit art therapy organization that provides art therapy for individuals and groups facing various challenges. Mrs. Pence observed an art therapy session for a group called Women in Transition, where participants explored issues facing women through creative processes. She also participated in a roundtable discussion with The Art Station's therapists. At Children's Medical Center, Mrs. Pence learned about the music therapy program and observed a music therapy session with patients. Music therapists play a crucial role in helping children express their feelings, reducing pain, and addressing various needs. Second Lady Karen Pence's chosen initiative is art therapy, which she calls "Art Therapy: Healing with the HeART." Art therapy is an integrative mental health profession that uses art-making and creative processes to enrich individuals, families, and communities.
