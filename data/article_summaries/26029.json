This executive order, issued on February 28, 2017, focuses on the policy of protecting the nation's navigable waters from pollution while promoting economic growth and reducing regulatory uncertainty. The order calls for a review of the Clean Water Rule, which defines "Waters of the United States," to ensure consistency with the policy set forth in the order. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works are tasked with publishing a proposed rule rescinding or revising the Clean Water Rule and reviewing all orders, rules, regulations, guidelines, or policies related to it. The order also instructs the Administrator and Assistant Secretary to consider interpreting the term "navigable waters" in a manner consistent with the opinion of Justice Antonin Scalia in Rapanos v. United States. The order includes general provisions stating that it does not impair the authority granted by law to executive departments or agencies, and it is subject to applicable law and appropriations. It also clarifies that the order does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
