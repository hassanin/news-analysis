On January 27, 2009, President Barack Obama issued a memorandum addressing the unexpected and urgent refugee and migration needs related to Gaza. The memorandum states that it is important to the national interest to provide assistance under the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962. An amount not to exceed $20.3 million from the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund will be used to meet the refugee and migration needs, including contributions to international, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations, as well as administrative expenses of the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration of the Department of State. The memorandum concludes by authorizing the publication of this information in the Federal Register.
