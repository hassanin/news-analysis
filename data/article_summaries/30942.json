President Donald J. Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to North Korea will continue beyond June 26, 2020. This national emergency was declared in 2008 and has been expanded in scope several times since then. The continued existence and risk of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula, as well as the destabilizing actions and policies of the North Korean government, are cited as reasons for the extension. President Trump has determined that it is necessary to continue this national emergency due to the threat it poses to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.
