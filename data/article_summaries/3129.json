President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288 of March 6, 2003, with respect to certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other individuals undermining Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions, will continue beyond March 6, 2022. President Emmerson Mnangagwa has not implemented the necessary political and economic reforms to justify terminating the targeted sanctions program. The government security services in Zimbabwe have been consistently intimidating and violently repressing citizens, including opposition party members, union members, and journalists. The lack of progress in implementing fundamental reforms for the rule of law, democratic governance, and human rights protection leaves Zimbabweans vulnerable to ongoing repression and poses a continuing threat to peace and security in the region. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to maintain the national emergency and the sanctions in response to this threat.
