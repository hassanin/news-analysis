Vice President Joe Biden and Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board Chairman Earl Devaney have announced the release of a Presidential Memorandum that directs agencies to improve reporting compliance by recipients of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds. The Recovery Act requires recipients to submit quarterly reports on how they are using the funds, but some recipients have failed to file reports. The Memorandum aims to improve accountability by reporting the identities of noncompliant recipients and taking measures such as terminating awards or reclaiming misused funds. The Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board was created to provide transparency and prevent fraud, waste, and mismanagement in the use of Recovery-related funds.
