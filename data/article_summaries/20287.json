The Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with China to establish a radiation detection training center in Qinhuangdao, China. This agreement is part of the effort to prevent nuclear smuggling and enhance global peace and security. The training center will be the first of its kind in Asia and will receive support from NNSA's Second Line of Defense (SLD) program, which provides radiation detection equipment and training materials. This agreement complements a 2005 MOU that aims to combat nuclear and radiological smuggling and supports NNSA's Megaports Initiative. The NNSA's SLD program works with foreign governments to install radiation detection equipment at various entry points and provides training to detect smuggled nuclear and radioactive materials. The NNSA is a semi-autonomous agency within the U.S. Department of Energy responsible for enhancing national security through the military application of nuclear science.
