The White House has released a new resource called the "Guidebook to the Inflation Reduction Act's Clean Energy and Climate Investments in Indian Country." This guidebook provides clear descriptions of the tax incentives and funding programs available to Native American Tribes under the Inflation Reduction Act. The Act provides over $720 million for programs dedicated to Tribal lands and Native communities, with the goal of increasing access to affordable and clean electricity, building resilience against climate change, and bringing the benefits of clean energy to Indian Country. The guidebook also outlines Tribal eligibility for grant and loan programs, as well as clean energy tax incentives. It highlights that Tribes can now receive direct payments in lieu of tax credits, allowing them to get money back on their clean energy investments. The guidebook is part of President Biden's Investing in America agenda and aims to ensure transparency and engagement in the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act.
