The White House is launching the U.S. Digital Service, a team of digital experts who will work with government agencies to improve websites, identify and fix problems, and upgrade technology infrastructure. The team will establish standards, identify technology patterns, collaborate with agencies to address gaps in their capacity, and provide accountability. The Administration is also releasing two components, the Digital Services Playbook and the TechFAR Handbook, to guide agencies in delivering effective digital services and procuring digital services using innovative contracting practices. The goal is to improve and simplify the digital experience with the government.
