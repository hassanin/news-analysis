President Obama has signed an emergency declaration for the state of Connecticut due to severe storm conditions that occurred from October 29-30, 2011. This declaration allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate disaster relief efforts and provide assistance to save lives, protect property, and ensure public health and safety. FEMA is authorized to mobilize equipment and resources as needed to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. The federal funding for emergency protective measures will be provided at 75%. Stephen M. De Blasio Sr. has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. For further information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
