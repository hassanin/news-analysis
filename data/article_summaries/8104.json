National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan provided some context for the upcoming COP26 climate conference. He explained that the conference is not about creating a new climate change agreement, but rather about making the existing Paris Agreement a reality by taking action to meet the necessary targets. Sullivan emphasized the importance of getting the world aligned around the goal of staying within 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming and called on countries to step up their climate ambitions. He also highlighted the focus on adaptation at COP26, particularly for developing countries, and announced the United States' new PREPARE initiative for adaptation, which involves significant investments. Sullivan discussed the U.S.'s commitment to climate finance and its doubling of its contribution to hit the $100 billion per year target by 2023. He acknowledged that some countries, including China, still need to step up their efforts and expressed confidence that the pressure will build on them to do so. Sullivan also mentioned President Biden's bilateral meetings with the Estonian Prime Minister and Indonesian President, where various topics, including climate, will be discussed.
