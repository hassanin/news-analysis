The article is about an executive order issued by the President of the United States to update the eligibility criteria for the award of the Purple Heart. The order amends Executive Order 11016, which was originally issued in 1962. The updated criteria now include being wounded in any action against an enemy of the United States, in any action with an opposing armed force of a foreign country, or while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party. It also includes being wounded as a result of an act of any enemy, hostile foreign force, or in captivity or as a prisoner of war. The updated criteria also cover being wounded as a result of an international terrorist attack against the United States or a foreign nation friendly to the United States, as well as being wounded in military operations while serving outside the territory of the United States as part of a peacekeeping force. The order also specifies that the Purple Heart is not authorized for wounds or deaths resulting from the willful misconduct of the member. The executive order does not create any new rights or benefits enforceable by any party against the United States or its entities.
