President Obama will host a meeting with leaders of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in New York City on September 24, 2010. This will be the second ever U.S.-ASEAN leaders meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in November 2009, where the President and the ASEAN leaders pledged to deepen cooperation in various areas such as trade and investment, regional security, disaster management, food and energy security, and climate change. The upcoming meeting aims to assess progress on these issues, identify ways to strengthen U.S.-ASEAN relations, and discuss multilateral approaches for greater regional cooperation.
