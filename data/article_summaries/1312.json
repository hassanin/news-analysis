President Biden has declared a major disaster in Alaska due to flooding from May 12 to June 3, 2023. This declaration allows for federal funding to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in affected areas. Assistance includes grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and programs to help individuals and business owners recover. Federal funding is also available for emergency work, facility repair or replacement, and hazard mitigation measures. Lance E. Davis of FEMA has been appointed to coordinate federal recovery operations. Residents and business owners in designated areas can apply for assistance online, by phone, or through the FEMA App. Further designations may be made based on damage assessments.
