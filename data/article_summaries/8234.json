In this article, the author discusses the progress made in reducing inflation and maintaining a strong job market. The annual inflation rate has decreased by 65% from its peak, with gas prices also declining. The unemployment rate has remained below 4% for 21 consecutive months, the longest period in over 50 years. Additionally, wages, wealth, and the employment rate of working-age Americans have all increased since before the pandemic. The author emphasizes their commitment to lowering costs for families and mentions various efforts in this regard, such as eliminating fees, reducing prescription drug costs, and cutting energy costs. However, the author criticizes Congressional Republicans for prioritizing tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations, as well as aligning with special interests that hinder the goal of reducing everyday costs for American families. The author concludes by asserting their determination to continue working for the American people.
