The article highlights the negative consequences of House Republicans' proposed bills. It argues that these bills would increase costs for families, harm students, seniors, and rural communities, reduce support for law enforcement, and undermine the economy. The article also criticizes House Republicans for prioritizing tax cuts for millionaires and corporations instead of fulfilling the bipartisan budget agreement reached earlier. It claims that these cuts would add at least $100 billion to deficits over 10 years and that House Republicans are advocating for corporate tax giveaways that could cost over $500 billion. The Office of Management and Budget has released fact sheets outlining the detrimental impacts of these cuts on states and the District of Columbia. The article concludes by urging House Republicans to honor the bipartisan budget agreement and follow the law.
