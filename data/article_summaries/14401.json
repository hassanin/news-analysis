The White House Press Secretary released a statement regarding the House Republican budget. The statement emphasizes the President's belief in the need for a balanced plan to grow the economy and reduce the deficit, which includes investing in job creation, cutting wasteful spending, and strengthening programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The statement criticizes the House Republican budget for giving tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans without asking them to contribute to deficit reduction. It also criticizes the budget for making deep cuts to investments in education and research, and for turning Medicare into a voucher program. The President's plan, on the other hand, includes more Medicare savings through cracking down on waste and fraud, closing tax loopholes for the wealthy and big corporations, and investing in education, manufacturing, infrastructure, and small businesses. The statement concludes by highlighting the President's commitment to working with Republicans and Democrats to achieve a balanced approach to growing the economy and cutting the deficit.
