The US economy shows signs of a strong recovery, with record-breaking goods exports in April and a narrowing trade deficit. American businesses and farmers are selling more goods abroad, indicating economic growth. A major retailer also plans to lower prices for certain goods, reflecting a return to normal spending patterns. These developments suggest a transition from recovery to steady, stable economic growth. The progress is attributed to the economic plan of growing the economy from the bottom up and unsnarling supply chains. However, there is still work to be done to further build on the recovery and reduce costs for families.
