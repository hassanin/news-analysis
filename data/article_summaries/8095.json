President Biden, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, and Leader Schumer have reaffirmed their commitment to democracy and two key pieces of legislation: the For the People Act (H.R.1, S.1) and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act (H.R.4). They recognize the challenges ahead and agree on the importance of passing these bills in the House of Representatives and the Senate, while also withstanding constitutional challenges. The four leaders also agree on the moral imperative of passing legislation to protect against voter suppression, electoral subversion, dark money, and partisan gerrymandering. They are committed to working together urgently to achieve this goal.
