The President thanks Mark Sullivan for his 30 years of service at the United States Secret Service, where he protected five first families, including the President's own. Sullivan started in the Detroit Field Office before joining the Presidential Protective Division. Since 2006, he has served as Director of the agency with dedication and integrity. The Secret Service is known for protecting leaders but also safeguards the American people in various ways, such as securing large events and protecting the financial system. The President acknowledges Sullivan's leadership and wishes him the best.
