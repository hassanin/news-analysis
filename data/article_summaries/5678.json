The Biden-Harris Administration has launched the Talent Pipeline Challenge, a program aimed at connecting American workers to good jobs in infrastructure, supply chains, and manufacturing. The goal is to build education and training partnerships between employers and workers to create opportunities for a diverse group of workers. The program aims to provide skills training and match workers with in-demand jobs, particularly in infrastructure projects funded by the President's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The launch event was attended by Vice President Kamala Harris, First Lady Jill Biden, Cabinet Members, and senior administration officials, as well as leading employers, unions, training providers, and industry associations. Participants discussed the importance of expanding the search for skilled workers to historically excluded communities and emphasized the need for partnerships between employers and training providers to create a well-trained, highly skilled, and diverse workforce. Employers and organizations showcased their commitment to training investments and partnerships, highlighting examples of successful programs. Community colleges and unions emphasized the importance of their partnerships with employers, while local officials praised the flexibility and timing of funding from the American Rescue Plan for key investments in training.
