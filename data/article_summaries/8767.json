President Biden has announced an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine, bringing the total U.S. security assistance committed to Ukraine to $1 billion in the past week and $2 billion since the start of the Biden Administration. The assistance will involve direct transfers of equipment from the Department of Defense to the Ukrainian military to help them defend against Russia's invasion. This includes weapons and munitions, as well as short-range and longer-range air defense systems. The United States is also working with allies to expedite additional assistance to Ukraine, with at least 30 countries providing security assistance since the Russian invasion began.
