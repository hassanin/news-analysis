The statement from the NSC spokesperson, Caitlin Hayden, addresses reports of a Russian armored military column in Ukraine. The spokesperson states that they are working to gather more information and cannot currently confirm the reports. However, they express concern about repeated Russian incursions into Ukraine and state that Russia has no right to send vehicles, people, or cargo into Ukraine without permission. The spokesperson also highlights Russia's escalation in destabilizing Ukraine, including supplying separatist fighters with weapons and firing artillery and rockets into Ukraine from Russian territory. The statement calls on Russia to end its firing into Ukraine, stop supplying weapons to separatists, and close the border to militants. The US supports humanitarian efforts in Ukraine, but emphasizes that the Russian military intervention is contradictory to resolving the crisis peacefully.
