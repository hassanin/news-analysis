The Vice President of the United States hosted a meeting with a group of Democratic Senators to discuss Iran. The Vice President emphasized the goal of the ongoing diplomatic negotiations between the P5+1 and Iran, which is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The current proposal would halt Iran's nuclear program and roll it back in key areas. The Vice President also mentioned that the relief provided to Iran as part of the proposal would be modest and temporary compared to the impact of existing sanctions. The meeting lasted approximately two hours and included several Democratic Senators.
