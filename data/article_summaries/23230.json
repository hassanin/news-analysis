Peter Peterson, Chairman of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, has released a statement in response to President Obama's fiscal policy speech. Peterson commends the President for proposing a framework that takes a step towards achieving fiscal sustainability. He emphasizes the need for a comprehensive plan for long-term deficit reduction and supports the President's call for bipartisan negotiations with representatives from both houses of Congress. Peterson believes that any successful plan must be bipartisan and include both spending cuts and revenue increases. He suggests addressing all major areas of the budget, including tax expenditures, defense, entitlements, and discretionary spending. Peterson concludes by urging leaders from both parties to find common ground in order to secure a prosperous future for all citizens.
