In this press gaggle, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs discusses various topics. He is asked about President Obama's thoughts on the apparent suicide of David Kellermann, to which Gibbs replies that he has not spoken to the President about it and has no comment. He is also asked about the President's position on torture memos and the possibility of appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Bush-era officials. Gibbs clarifies that the President believes those who acted in good faith based on legal advice should not be subject to prosecution, and that the determination of whether laws were broken would be made by legal officials, not by the President. Gibbs also mentions a planned summit with Zardari and Karzai and the President's focus on finding solutions to problems in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He discusses the cap-and-trade system and its benefits for renewable energy and job creation. Gibbs also mentions Ellen Moran leaving her position as White House Communications Director to become the chief of staff for the Commerce Secretary and reflects on Iowa's significance to President Obama.
