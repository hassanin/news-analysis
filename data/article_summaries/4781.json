Today marks the 20th anniversary of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and the organization is being recognized for its significant contributions to global development. The MCC has implemented an innovative, data-driven development model that has positively impacted the lives of millions of people worldwide. The organization's approach is based on partnerships with low-income and lower-middle-income countries that prioritize good governance, democracy, and investments in their people. Over the past two decades, the MCC has made critical investments in various areas such as agriculture, healthcare, education, and climate-resilient infrastructure. With bipartisan support from Congress, the MCC has provided nearly $17 billion in aid to 47 countries across six continents, lifting over 300 million people out of poverty and promoting economic growth in marginalized communities. The projects initiated by the MCC have left a lasting impact on the communities they have reached, and there is optimism for the continued positive outcomes in the future.
