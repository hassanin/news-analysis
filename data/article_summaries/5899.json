President Biden will lead the Investing in Rural America Event Series, where he and other administration officials will travel across the country to highlight the investments being made in rural communities. These investments include climate smart agriculture, infrastructure funding, clean energy initiatives, improvements to water and wastewater systems, and support for local and regional food systems. The administration aims to ensure that rural Americans have access to opportunities and do not have to leave their hometowns to find them. The event series will showcase how investing in America means investing equitably in all of America, leaving no one behind.
