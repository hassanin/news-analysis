President Obama issued a statement urging Americans to get tested for HIV and take control of their health. He highlighted that 1 in 5 Americans living with HIV are unaware of their status and that the majority of sexually transmitted infections are spread by people who do not know they are infected. Once people become aware of their HIV status, they are more likely to take steps to reduce transmission. President Obama emphasized that HIV remains a major threat to the nation's health and that infection rates are particularly high among gay and bisexual men, African Americans, and Latinos. He pledged to develop and implement a comprehensive National HIV/AIDS Strategy focused on reducing HIV incidence, increasing access to care, and reducing health disparities. However, he also stressed that individuals must take responsibility for reducing their risk of HIV transmission and supporting affected individuals and communities. This involves getting tested for HIV, ending stigma and discrimination, embracing all neighbors, and responding compassionately to those at increased risk for HIV infection. President Obama expressed confidence that by working together, the spread of HIV can be stopped and those affected can receive the necessary care and support.
