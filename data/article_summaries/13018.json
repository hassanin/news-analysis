The article discusses the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria. The President of the United States has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency, which was declared in 2004 and modified in subsequent executive orders, will continue beyond May 11, 2012. The Syrian regime's brutality, repression of its citizens, obstruction of the Lebanese government, pursuit of chemical and biological weapons, and support of terrorist organizations pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The United States condemns the regime's use of violence and human rights abuses and calls for a political transition in Syria towards greater freedom, democracy, and justice. The future of the national emergency will depend on changes in the composition, policies, and actions of the Syrian government.
