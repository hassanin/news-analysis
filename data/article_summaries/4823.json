In recognition of National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, President Joe Biden emphasizes the need to raise awareness about the risk factors, early screenings, and affordable treatment options for colorectal cancer, which is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. The administration aims to improve the accessibility of cancer care and learn from patients' experiences to prevent obstacles to prevention and treatment. Efforts should be focused on individuals over the age of 45, Black Americans, those with a family history of colorectal cancer, and individuals who smoke, consume alcohol, or are obese. Early detection through regular screenings is crucial for improving survival rates, and symptoms such as blood in the stool, changes in bowel habits, stomach pain, bloating, cramps, or unexplained weight loss should prompt consultation with a doctor. The administration is committed to developing new treatments to transform cancer into a chronic disease that can be managed or cured. Initiatives such as the Cancer Moonshot and the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) have been established to support breakthroughs in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Efforts are also being made to make existing cancer care more affordable, such as through the expansion of the Affordable Care Act and the capping of prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare. The administration is working with the private sector to increase access to cancer screenings, develop new treatments, and promote cancer prevention and healthy diets. President Biden encourages citizens and organizations to participate in activities that raise awareness and prevent colorectal cancer and to explore health coverage options under the Affordable Care Act.
