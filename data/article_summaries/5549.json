The Biden-Harris Administration is proposing a new rule to eliminate junk fees and promote competition in the financial industry. Currently, financial advisers may receive payment from the saver or the firm they recommend investment products from, creating a conflict of interest. This often leads to savers selecting products that generate lower returns. By requiring advisers to act in the best interest of the saver, retirement savers' returns could increase by up to 1.2% per year, resulting in potentially 20% more retirement savings over a lifetime. The proposed rule aims to minimize junk fees, promote competition, and protect American workers' retirements. This initiative is part of the broader Bidenomics agenda to grow the economy from the middle class and bottom up. It builds on previous efforts to eliminate hidden fees and increase transparency in various sectors, such as banking, airlines, and consumer services. The administration has also taken steps to protect retirement benefits, including encouraging more employers to offer retirement plans and safeguarding pension plans for millions of workers.
