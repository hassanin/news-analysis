The humanitarian community's Famine Review Committee has projected that parts of Somalia will likely experience famine between October and December without significant expansion of assistance. The United States is deeply concerned about this projection and the high level of need in the country and the region. The likely famine is a result of various factors, including climate change, the devastating effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the increased cost of food, fertilizer, and fuel due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A formal declaration of famine is rare and occurs when people experience severe acute malnutrition, starvation, and death. Timely assistance at a large scale can prevent it. The United States has increased its relief efforts, providing emergency assistance to over 3.5 million people per month, including food, malnutrition treatment, disease outbreak response, shelter, protection services, and access to safe drinking water and sanitation. The US has allocated more than $706 million this fiscal year alone to address drought in Somalia, which represents over half of all humanitarian funding for the country in 2022. However, there is a need for additional significant contributions from other donors to meet the rising levels of need. Immediate action from the international community is crucial to save lives and prevent the projected famine.
