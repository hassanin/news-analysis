In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims July 28, 2014, as World Hepatitis Day. He highlights the global prevalence of viral hepatitis, with one in twelve people worldwide living with the disease. In the United States, millions of Americans are infected, with two-thirds unaware of their infection. Viral hepatitis can go undetected for many years, leading to long-term liver damage and thousands of deaths annually. The article emphasizes the importance of public awareness and prevention measures, such as vaccination and early detection. Certain communities, including African Americans, American Indians, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, baby boomers, and people living with HIV, are disproportionately affected by viral hepatitis. The Affordable Care Act has expanded access to prevention, care, and treatment for viral hepatitis. The article also mentions the updated comprehensive Action Plan for the Prevention, Care, and Treatment of Viral Hepatitis, which aims to raise awareness, reduce new cases, and save lives. President Obama calls on citizens, government agencies, non-profit organizations, and communities to participate in activities that increase awareness about hepatitis and prevent its spread.
