This article is a notice from the White House stating that the national emergency with respect to Somalia, which was declared on April 12, 2010, will be continued for another year. The national emergency was declared due to the fragile security situation, persistent violence, acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, and violations of the Somalia arms embargo imposed by the United Nations Security Council. The continuation of the national emergency is deemed necessary as the situation in Somalia still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
