The article discusses the failed attempt to arrange a meeting between President Obama and President Rouhani of Iran at the United Nations General Assembly. Senior administration officials explain that while they were open to a discussion between the two leaders, they did not plan for a formal bilateral meeting. The Iranians ultimately declined the opportunity for an informal encounter, citing complications domestically. The officials emphasize that the important work of resolving the nuclear issue will be done through substantive negotiations between Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister Zarif in the P5-plus-1 framework. They believe that the willingness of the United States to engage with Iran has strengthened international support for sanctions and pressure. The officials confirm that the diplomatic process will be carried forward through Secretary Kerry's meetings with his counterpart and stress that negotiations will not take place at the presidential level, but rather at the foreign minister level.
