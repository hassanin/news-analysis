President Obama and President Karzai had a 30-minute video teleconference where they discussed various topics, including the long-term U.S.-Afghan relations, the recent Afghan parliamentary elections, and regional relations. Secretary Clinton, Secretary Gates, Deputy National Security Advisor Tom Donilon, Chief of Staff Pete Rouse, Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, General David Petraeus, and Lieutenant General (retired) Doug Lute also participated in the discussion. Both leaders agreed to continue engaging with each other to develop a common vision and align efforts to support President Karzai's goal of transitioning to Afghan lead security responsibility by 2014. They also agreed to work towards concluding the U.S.-Afghan Strategic Partnership Declaration by the end of the year and support two Afghanistan-related themes at the NATO Summit in November: transition to Afghan lead and a commitment to the Afghan people.
