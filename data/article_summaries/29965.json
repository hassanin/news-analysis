The White House will be opening its gardens and grounds to visitors on October 21 and October 22. Visitors will have access to the South Lawn, Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, Rose Garden, and the White House Kitchen Garden. The event is free, but tickets are required and will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. Certain items are not allowed on the White House grounds, such as aerosols, animals (except guide dogs), backpacks, balloons, and firearms. Strollers, wheelchairs, umbrellas, and cameras are permitted. In case of bad weather, the event may be cancelled, so visitors are advised to call the information line to check the status.
