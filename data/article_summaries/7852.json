The United States and Japan have resolved to promote prosperity and strengthen the rules-based economic order in the Indo-Pacific region and the world. They recognize the progress made under the U.S.-Japan Competitiveness and Resilience Partnership and commit to broaden and deepen bilateral economic cooperation. They also aim to strengthen people-to-people ties by expanding collaboration and participation in research projects and international exchange programs, with a focus on empowering women in society. Exchange programs have engaged civil society, the public and private sectors to encourage women's role in business, government, and STEM fields.
