President Barack Obama has issued a memorandum of disapproval on S.J. Res. 23, a joint resolution that would nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) carbon pollution standards for new, modified, and reconstructed power plants. In the memorandum, President Obama states that climate change poses a profound threat to our future and future generations, with atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide higher than they have been in at least 800,000 years. The EPA has determined that greenhouse gas pollution endangers Americans' health and welfare, and established science confirms that we will experience intensified impacts as the planet warms. Power plants are the largest source of greenhouse gas pollution in the country, and the carbon pollution standards and Clean Power Plan ensure that there are national standards to reduce carbon emissions from power plants. By blocking these standards, S.J. Res. 23 would delay the transition to cleaner electricity generating technologies and enable the continued build-out of outdated, high-polluting infrastructure. President Obama cannot support the resolution as it overturns critical carbon pollution standards that are necessary to protect against climate change and ensure the health and well-being of the nation.
