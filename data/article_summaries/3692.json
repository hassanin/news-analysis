President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed April 28, 2021, as Workers Memorial Day in the United States. In his proclamation, he emphasizes the importance of honoring the workers who have tragically lost their lives or been harmed in the workplace and reaffirms the commitment to ensuring a safe and healthy work environment for all American workers. The proclamation highlights the role of labor unions in fighting for safer work conditions and protections from the federal government. It acknowledges that despite progress, many workers still fear retaliation and retribution from management when it comes to performing unsafe tasks or working in unsanitary conditions. The President calls for the passage of the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act of 2021, which empowers workers to exercise their right to organize and hold management accountable. The proclamation emphasizes the need to protect workers and reduce workplace accidents, injuries, and fatalities. It concludes by urging all Americans to observe Workers Memorial Day with appropriate service, community, and education programs to remember those who have been affected by unsafe working conditions.
