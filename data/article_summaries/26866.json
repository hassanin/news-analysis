President Donald J. Trump has signed an executive order imposing further economic sanctions on Venezuela. The order prohibits transactions related to the provision of financing for new debt of Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PdVSA) with a maturity of over 90 days, new debt of the rest of the Venezuelan government with a maturity of over 30 days, new equity of the government (including PdVSA), bonds issued by the government before the effective date of the order, and dividend payments or other distributions of profit to the government from any entity owned or controlled by the government. The order also prohibits purchases of securities from the Venezuelan government. The Secretary of the Treasury has been granted the authority to issue general licenses to mitigate any hardship to the American and Venezuelan people resulting from this action.
