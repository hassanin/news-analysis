In a recent NSC background call, senior administration officials discussed President Biden's new executive order aimed at bringing home American hostages and wrongful detainees. The executive order, titled "Bolstering Efforts to Bring Hostages and Wrongfully Detained U.S. Nationals Home," provides new tools to aid in the repatriation of Americans held captive abroad. It authorizes the imposition of financial sanctions and visa bans on individuals involved in wrongful detention, regardless of whether they are state actors or non-state actors. The executive order also emphasizes the government's commitment to supporting the families of wrongfully detained individuals and improving transparency regarding the risks of wrongful detention. In addition to the executive order, a new risk indicator, the "D" indicator for wrongful detention, will be introduced to the State Department's travel advisories. This indicator will inform American travelers of the risk of wrongful detention by foreign governments and provide comprehensive safety and security information for informed travel decisions. The executive order and the "D" indicator aim to impose consequences on perpetrators, increase transparency, and prevent future cases of wrongful detention. The officials also addressed questions regarding the use of sanctions, the President's potential meetings with families of detainees, and the criteria for determining wrongful detention.
