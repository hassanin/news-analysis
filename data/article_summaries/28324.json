President Trump has signed into law H.R. 7318, an Act that amends the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016. The Act ensures that the Public Buildings Reform Board has adequate time to carry out its responsibilities. However, the Act fails to address a constitutional concern regarding the appointment of members to the Board. The 2016 Act requires the President to appoint six of the seven members from recommendations provided by Members of Congress. The President believes that this requirement is advisory and does not constrain his appointment powers as the head of the executive branch.
