The United States government, under President Biden's leadership, is committed to condemning sexual violence in all its forms and supporting survivors. They acknowledge that women and girls globally continue to face threats and attacks, particularly in conflict and crisis situations. The US stands in solidarity with those affected, such as Ukrainian women targeted by Russian forces, Sudanese women terrorized by paramilitary forces, Ethiopian women facing mass reports of sexual violence, and Haitian communities coerced through sexual assault by gangs. Recently, there have been reports of severe sexual violence by Hamas terrorists against women and children in Israel. While sexual violence in conflict is widespread, the US believes it can be ended and considers it unacceptable. President Biden has made addressing gender-based violence a priority throughout his career, and last year he signed a Presidential Memorandum to strengthen tools against sexual violence in conflict. In June of this year, the US imposed its first-ever sanctions specifically targeting conflict-related sexual violence. To mark Human Rights week and the end of the 16 Days of Action Against Gender-Based Violence, the Department of Treasury and the State Department issued sanctions against thirteen individuals from four countries connected to acts of sexual violence. This marks the largest set of financial sanctions and visa restrictions against individuals involved in this form of abuse. The US government believes that sexual violence in conflict goes against our shared humanity and that perpetrators must be held accountable while survivors must have access to services and support. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to prioritize efforts to combat and address gender-based violence, including conflict-related sexual violence, and will work towards including women and girls in justice, peace, and stability initiatives.
