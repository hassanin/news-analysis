President Obama announced the creation of the Small Business Lending Fund, which will transfer $30 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to support small business lending. The fund will target community and smaller banks that lend the most to small businesses and offer incentives for banks to increase small business lending. The program is separate from TARP to encourage broader participation by banks. The core function of the fund is to offer capital with incentives to increase small business lending. As participating banks increase lending to small firms, the dividend paid to Treasury on that capital investment would be reduced. The administration will also discuss with Congress additional ideas to enhance credit for small businesses through the Small Business Lending Fund.
