The White House has launched the "Healthy Communities Challenge" to engage communities with high numbers of uninsured individuals. The goal is to help these communities reach the remaining 10.5 million uninsured Americans who are eligible for Marketplace coverage. At the end of the open enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services will compare the number of new sign-ups in participating communities to the estimated number of eligible uninsured individuals at the start of enrollment. The community with the most progress will receive recognition, a healthier community, and a visit from President Obama. Dallas is one of the communities participating in the challenge. The article also provides information on health insurance coverage in Texas, such as the affordability of plans and the percentage of people who can find plans for $100 or less. It emphasizes that tax credits are beneficial and that consumers have a choice of plans. Despite progress in reducing the uninsured rate, there is still work to be done, and 446,000 uninsured individuals in the Dallas area are eligible for Marketplace coverage.
