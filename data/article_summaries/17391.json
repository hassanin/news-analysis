On April 7, 2010, the President signed two laws: H.J.Res. 80, which recognizes and honors the Blinded Veterans Association on its 65th anniversary, and H.R. 4621, the "Prevent Deceptive Census Look Alike Mailings Act." The latter law prohibits the U.S. Postal Service from delivering a solicitation by a non-governmental entity if it uses the term "census" on the envelope, unless the solicitation includes disclaimers stating it is not a government document and includes the name and accurate return address of the entity that sent it.
