The President of the United States has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus will continue beyond its anniversary date of June 16, 2017. The President believes that the actions and policies of these individuals to undermine democratic processes, commit human rights abuses, and engage in public corruption pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13405.
