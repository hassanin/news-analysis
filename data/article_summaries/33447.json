The U.S. economy reached a significant milestone last week, as the number of Americans applying for unemployment insurance (UI) payments hit a 49-year low. Only 209,000 Americans applied for UI, the lowest number since December 1969. This is remarkable considering that the labor force today is almost double the size it was 49 years ago. The figure below shows that in March, initial UI claims represented 0.141 percent of the labor force, just above the record low set in February. Since President Trump took office in 2017, initial claims as a percentage of the labor force have fallen by 7.1 percent. This, along with other indicators such as the unemployment rate of 4.1 percent, suggests that the labor market is strong. The article concludes that as President Trump's policies continue to benefit the economy and workers, we can expect continued success in the labor market going forward.
