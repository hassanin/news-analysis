The Biden-Harris Administration has released the Nature-Based Solutions Roadmap at COP27 in Egypt, outlining strategic recommendations to harness the power of nature-based solutions in addressing climate change and nature loss. This is the first time the U.S. has developed a strategy to scale up nature-based solutions. The Administration is also announcing new interagency commitments aligned with the roadmap, including actions to ensure over $25 billion in infrastructure and climate funding can support nature-based solutions. Nature-based solutions involve actions to protect, manage, or restore natural ecosystems to address societal challenges like climate change. They can increase resilience to threats and slow climate change by capturing and storing carbon dioxide. The roadmap calls for updating policies, unlocking funding, leading with federal facilities and assets, training the workforce, and prioritizing research and innovation in nature-based solutions. The Administration is already advancing nature-based solutions in support of its climate goals, and the roadmap will help seize additional opportunities. The Administration has also released a companion resource guide with examples and resources to spur action.
