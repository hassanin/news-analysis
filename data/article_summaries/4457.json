President Biden has submitted a proposal to Congress to address the immigration system, which his administration believes is broken. Congresswoman Linda SÃ¡nchez and House Democrats have reintroduced legislation aimed at managing and securing the border, ensuring the safety of families and communities, and improving migration management in the Western Hemisphere. However, House Republicans are accused of playing politics and engaging in stunts instead of working together. They are also pushing for spending cuts that would lead to the firing of over 2,000 border patrol agents and a decrease in border security.
