President Donald Trump has nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia. The nomination process was marked by a high level of transparency and involvement by the American voters. Judge Gorsuch, who was born and raised in Colorado, attended Columbia University, Harvard Law School, and Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar. He clerked for Judge David Sentelle of the D.C. Circuit and Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. Judge Gorsuch joined the Department of Justice and was later nominated by President George W. Bush for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, where he has served with distinction. He is known for his intelligence, clear writing style, and fairness to all parties. Judge Gorsuch expressed his honor and humility in receiving the nomination and looks forward to meeting with Senators as the confirmation process begins.
