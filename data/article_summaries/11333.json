The NEA president, Dennis Van Roekel, applauds the plan for putting unemployed construction workers back on the job to modernize schools and community colleges. He also highlights the backlog of repairs in public schools and the detrimental effects of unemployment on communities and schools. Van Roekel mentions overcrowded classes, cut programs, and students lacking basic supplies as some of the issues faced by educators. The NEA supports the plan's inclusion of $30 billion in local jobs assistance to help educators get back to their classrooms and prepare students for success. The article concludes by urging Congress to prioritize passing the American Jobs Act and emphasizing the importance of putting aside partisan differences to boost the economy and create opportunities for children.
