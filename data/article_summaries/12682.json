President Obama expresses his sadness at the passing of Dr. Benjamin Hooks, a significant figure in the American civil rights movement. Dr. Hooks served as the leader of the NAACP for 16 years, inspiring others to work towards a stronger nation for all Americans. He was also the first African American criminal court judge in Tennessee and the first African American to serve on the Federal Communications Commission. Dr. Hooks received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and dedicated his time to mentoring others and preaching as a pastor. President Obama believes that Dr. Hooks' contributions have enriched the nation and given a voice to the voiceless. He offers his thoughts and prayers to Dr. Hooks' family and all who knew him.
