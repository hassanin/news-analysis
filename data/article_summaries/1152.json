The Senate Republicans have blocked the Women's Health Protection Act, which aims to protect access to reproductive health care. This decision goes against the majority of American people and comes at a time when women's constitutional rights are being threatened. The Republicans in Congress have chosen to hinder Americans' rights to make personal decisions about their bodies. To protect the right to choose, it is important to elect more pro-choice senators in November. The Women's Health Protection Act is crucial for the health, safety, and progress of the nation. Although it did not pass, the administration will continue to fight for access to reproductive care and defend women's constitutional rights as established in Roe v. Wade.
