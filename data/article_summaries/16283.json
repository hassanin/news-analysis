President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Iowa and authorized federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred from June 20-25, 2015. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to state, tribal, and local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also be eligible for federal funding. David G. Samaniego has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
