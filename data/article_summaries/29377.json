The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) under the Trump administration has assembled a team of over 50 staff members to advise the President on science and technology matters. The OSTP policy advisors are working on various topics, including advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, cybersecurity, healthcare, nanotechnology, and space and aeronautics. The Trump administration has allocated $151.2 billion for federal research and development (R&D) in the FY 2018 budget, demonstrating its commitment to technological advancement and national security. The OSTP has also been involved in international efforts to promote the free flow of data, prevent data localization requirements, and collaborate with other countries on scientific initiatives. In addition, the OSTP has created a new committee to address policies related to tech transfer, infrastructure utilization, open data, and workforce development.
