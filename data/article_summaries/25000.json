President Obama has issued a proclamation declaring April 6-12, 2014, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. This year marks the anniversaries of the Victims of Crime Act, the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, and the Violence Against Women Act. The proclamation acknowledges the importance of upholding the rights of crime victims, including women leaving abusive relationships, families seeking justice for a loved one's murder, and children escaping trafficking rings. The President's administration is taking action to prevent crime, particularly against those most at risk. Initiatives such as the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault and the My Brother's Keeper program are aimed at addressing sexual assault on college campuses and violence against young men of color. The President's budget proposes funding to process rape kits, pursue cold cases, and support victims throughout the process. The proclamation calls on all Americans to raise awareness of victims' rights and services and to volunteer to help victims in their time of need.
