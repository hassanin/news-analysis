President Joseph R. Biden has proclaimed November 2022 as National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month. In his statement, he acknowledges the millions of Americans affected by Alzheimer's and the caregivers who support them. He highlights the devastating impact of the disease, which robs individuals of their memories and identity over time. The article mentions that the number of Americans with Alzheimer's is expected to reach nearly 14 million in the next 30 years, putting a strain on families and the healthcare system. President Biden discusses the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), a billion-dollar investment in research to prevent, treat, and cure Alzheimer's and other diseases. He emphasizes the importance of innovative ideas in biomedical research to drive breakthroughs. The Department of Health and Human Services is also investing in research, technology, and education to support Alzheimer's patients, their caregivers, and raise awareness about early warning signs and brain health. President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which caps the amount Alzheimer's patients pay for medication at $2,000 per year. He emphasizes the need to prioritize older Black and Brown Americans, who are disproportionately affected by dementias. President Biden states that finding a cure for Alzheimer's is a non-partisan issue, and he calls for unity to support caregivers, improve treatments, and work towards a cure. He encourages Americans to visit Alzheimers.gov for resources and information.
