The article discusses the dire consequences of congressional Republicans' decision to not extend the enhanced Child Tax Credit. It states that child poverty has increased as a result of this policy choice, which prioritizes corporate tax cuts over helping families with children. The author argues that no child should grow up in poverty and calls for the restoration of the expanded Child Tax Credit to provide tax relief and breathing room for millions of families.
