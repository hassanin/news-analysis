The Second International Counter Ransomware Initiative (CRI) Summit was held by the White House, bringing together 36 countries, the EU, and private sector partners to address the issue of ransomware attacks. Ransomware is a global problem that affects thousands of companies and individuals each year. The summit aimed to develop cooperative actions to counter the spread and impact of ransomware. The CRI has been working over the past year to increase resilience, disrupt cyber criminals, counter illicit finance, build partnerships, and cooperate globally. To further this work, the CRI will establish an International Counter Ransomware Task Force (ICRTF) to coordinate activities related to resilience, disruption, and counter illicit finance. They will also create a fusion cell to test information sharing commitments and publish reports on ransomware trends. The CRI will deliver an investigator's toolkit, engage the private sector, and publish joint advisories on tactics for key ransomware actors. They will also undertake counter ransomware exercises and develop a capacity-building tool for public-private partnerships. During the summit, CRI partners committed to holding a counter-illicit finance ransomware workshop, taking steps to prevent ransomware actors from using cryptocurrency, sharing information, and pursuing the development of frameworks and guidelines. They also pledged to address ransomware in multilateral formats and increase diplomatic engagement. The CRI will coordinate cyber capacity building programs to strengthen resilience and law enforcement capacity in combating ransomware.
