During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany made several announcements and addressed various topics. She started by announcing that the results of President Trump's annual physical are ready, and that he remains healthy. She also congratulated the winners of the recent primary elections and highlighted President Trump's endorsement record.

McEnany then transitioned to discussing the ongoing protests in the country. She emphasized that while the First Amendment grants the right to peaceably assemble, it does not give anyone the right to riot, loot, burn buildings, deface property, or assault private citizens and police officers. She referenced the March on Washington in 1963 as an example of peaceful protest and quoted Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech.

She also acknowledged the deaths of George Floyd and retired police captain David Dorn, who was killed by looters in St. Louis. McEnany called for unity, law, and order in the country.

During the question and answer session, McEnany addressed topics such as Secretary of Defense Mark Esper's comments, police oversight, the clearing of protesters near the White House, the President's inspection of the basement, the use of the Insurrection Act, and the President's stance on systemic bias in law enforcement.

She defended the actions taken to clear the protesters, stating that officers used minimal force to protect themselves and prevent further violence. McEnany also emphasized that the President believes in addressing injustices while recognizing the majority of police officers as good, hardworking people.

McEnany concluded the briefing by mentioning several police officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty and expressing support for law enforcement.
