President Biden has announced three new federal judicial nominees who are highly qualified and dedicated to upholding the rule of law and the Constitution. These nominations reflect the President's commitment to ensuring diversity in the nation's courts, both in terms of personal and professional backgrounds. One notable nominee is Judge Doris Pryor, who, if confirmed, would be the first judge of color to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit from Indiana. These nominations bring the total number of announced federal judicial nominees by President Biden to 98. The President has prioritized filling judicial vacancies and has already secured the confirmation of the most lower court judges in the first year of a presidency since the Kennedy Administration. The three nominees are Rachel S. Bloomekatz for the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, Florence Y. Pan for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and Doris L. Pryor for the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Each nominee has an impressive legal background and experience in various roles within the legal system.
