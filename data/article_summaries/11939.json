In this article, President Barack Obama issues a memorandum regarding the Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for Liberians who have been residing in the United States. The United States has provided safe haven for Liberians since 1991 due to armed conflict and civil strife in their country. Temporary Protected Status (TPS) was granted to them, but it ended in 2007. President Bush then deferred the enforced departure for Liberians under TPS, which is set to expire on March 31, 2009. President Obama determines that there are compelling foreign policy reasons to extend the DED for Liberians currently residing in the United States. Under this memorandum, the removal of any Liberian national or person without nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia will be deferred for 12 months, starting from March 31, 2009. This grant of DED only applies to those who have continuously resided in the United States since October 1, 2002, and meet certain criteria. The memorandum also authorizes employment for eligible Liberians for the same 12-month period.
