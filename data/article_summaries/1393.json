President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed September 12 through September 18, 2021, as National Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) Week. HSIs play a crucial role in preparing Hispanic American scholars, artists, researchers, scientists, educators, and leaders who contribute to the strength and stability of the United States. These institutions equip students with the knowledge and skills needed to compete in the 21st-century economy and celebrate the diverse backgrounds of the Hispanic community. HSIs also positively impact their communities and have been instrumental in safeguarding the rights and dignity of Dreamers and first-generation college students. President Biden's administration has made efforts to support the health, education, equity, and economic well-being of Hispanic Americans. The proclamation calls on public officials, educators, and the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate programs and activities that recognize the contributions of HSIs and their graduates.
