President Donald J. Trump has signed an Executive Order aimed at closing a security loophole for United States Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) products. This loophole has been exploited by foreign malicious cyber actors to target American critical infrastructure and steal intellectual property and sensitive data. The Executive Order, titled "Taking Additional Steps to Address the National Emergency with Respect to Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities," aims to reduce the access and ability of these actors to use United States ICTS (information technology and communication services) products for nefarious purposes. The President's action is seen as a significant step in protecting the American people from cyber threats.
