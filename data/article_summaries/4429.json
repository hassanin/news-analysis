The U.S. government has announced the relocation of the first group of Afghan special immigrants under Operation Allies Refuge. This program aims to support the relocation of Afghan nationals and their families who have supported the U.S. government and are in the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) application process. The program has bipartisan support and has been a priority for multiple administrations. The first group of Afghan special immigrants has completed rigorous security background checks and will be resettled in cities across the United States. The focus is on relocating approximately 700 principal SIV applicants and their immediate families. The safety and privacy of these individuals and their families are paramount, so no details about their transit will be disclosed. The U.S. government is also considering options to evacuate other individuals, such as women's leaders, activists, human rights defenders, civil society members, and journalists who are under threat from the Taliban. The administration is working on finding efficiencies and streamlining the relocation process to maximize the number of people who can be relocated. The U.S. partnership with Afghanistan will continue, and the Consular Section in Kabul will continue processing SIVs. The relocation process at Fort Lee is expected to take about seven days, and media access to the applicants will be limited to respect their privacy. The U.S. government is working to support those left behind in Afghanistan by moving them to a third-country location where they can be safe while their visa processing continues. The program will continue even after the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Afghan SIV applicants can contact the National Visa Center for inquiries.
