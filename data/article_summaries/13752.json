President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Connecticut due to a snowstorm that occurred in January 2011. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and emergency protective measures in several counties and tribal lands. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding. Albert Lewis has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA at (202) 646-3272.
