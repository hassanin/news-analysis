President Trump has authorized the Department of Homeland Security, specifically the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate disaster relief efforts in Puerto Rico. This includes providing assistance for emergency measures to save lives, protect property, and ensure public health and safety. FEMA is authorized to mobilize resources and equipment to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. The federal government will provide 75 percent funding for emergency protective measures, such as mass care and evacuation support. Alex Amparo has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. For more information, contact the FEMA News Desk.
