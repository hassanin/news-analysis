President Obama has proposed a Blueprint to support US manufacturing jobs, discourage outsourcing, and encourage insourcing. The proposals include six actions that Congress should take immediately, which are fully paid for by closing tax loopholes. The actions include removing tax deductions for shipping jobs overseas and providing incentives for bringing them back to the US, targeting the domestic production incentive on manufacturers who create jobs in the US, introducing a new Manufacturing Communities Tax Credit to encourage investments in communities affected by job loss, providing temporary tax credits to drive clean energy manufacturing, reauthorizing 100% expensing of investment in plants and equipment, and closing a loophole that allows companies to shift profits overseas. The President is also pushing for corporate tax reform that encourages greater investment in the US and eliminates tax advantages for outsourcing. The President has already taken steps to support businesses, such as providing tax incentives for growth and investment, supporting domestic investment in clean energy technology manufacturing, and cracking down on overseas tax avoidance and loopholes.
