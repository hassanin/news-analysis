The White House has unveiled the official souvenir egg and logo for the 2011 Easter Egg Roll. The egg comes in four pastel colors and bears the stamped signatures of the President and First Lady. In an effort to be more environmentally friendly, the eggs are made from certified hardwood and the packaging is designed to minimize waste and environmental impact. The National Park Foundation produces and sells the eggs, which are given as souvenirs to children attending the Easter Egg Roll. The event promotes health and wellness, aligned with the First Lady's 'Let's Move!' initiative. The Easter Egg Roll will take place on April 25th.
