This article provides answers to several questions regarding the basis, methodology, and implementation of travel restrictions imposed on certain countries by the United States government. The requirements for these restrictions were established based on a report by the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence. The evaluation of foreign governments' information sharing practices was conducted through an analysis of current practices and input gathered during engagement with these countries. The restrictions differ by country due to their unique conditions and deficiencies. The countries designated for restrictions are Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen, and Somalia. The new proclamation applies to nationals from these countries who are applying for a U.S. visa, with certain exceptions. Visas will not be revoked for individuals who have a valid visa on the effective date of the proclamation. Countries can be removed from the travel suspension if they meet the requirements set by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The President has the authority to impose such restrictions under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. The restrictions and limitations took effect on different dates depending on the specific circumstances of each country.
