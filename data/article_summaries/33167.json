President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of West Virginia and has ordered Federal assistance to supplement State and local recovery efforts. The declaration comes in response to severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides that occurred from May 28 to June 3, 2018. Federal funding will be available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in the affected counties. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding. Steven S. Ward has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA news desk.
