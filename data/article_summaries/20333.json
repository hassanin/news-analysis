President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring May 22, 2013, as National Maritime Day in the United States. The proclamation honors the men and women of the United States Merchant Marine who have served and sacrificed to make the country what it is today. It recognizes their role in securing the nation's sovereignty during the American Revolution, sustaining critical supply lines for troops abroad, and driving economic growth by shipping products globally. The proclamation calls for the people of the United States to observe the day and display the flag, while also requesting that ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day.
