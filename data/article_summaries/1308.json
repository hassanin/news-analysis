On November 12, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to the threat posed by securities investments that finance certain companies of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The President found that the PRC is using US capital to develop its military and intelligence capabilities, which directly threatens the US homeland and forces overseas. The PRC's military-industrial complex, supported by civilian Chinese companies, poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.

On January 13, 2021, the President signed an amendment to the executive order, and on June 3, 2021, another executive order was signed to expand the scope of the national emergency. This expansion addressed the involvement of the PRC's military-industrial complex in research and development programs, weapons production, and the use of Chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or human rights abuses.

The national emergency declared in 2020 and expanded in 2021 continues to be a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, the President has decided to continue the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act.
