Vice President Harris had a productive discussion with Democratic and Republican members of Congress about the importance of investing in broadband infrastructure. The members, who have experience with broadband issues, represent both rural and urban areas and discussed the difficulties faced by Americans who lack access to high-speed internet. The meeting was substantive and informative. The President and Vice President have been meeting with bipartisan Congressional leaders to address infrastructure challenges, and they will continue engaging with members from both parties. The goal is to provide affordable and accessible high-speed internet to all Americans through investments in the American Jobs Plan, in order to increase economic opportunities and maintain competitiveness.
