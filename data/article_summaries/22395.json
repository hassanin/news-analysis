President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Delaware, ordering federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following a severe winter storm and flooding that occurred in January 2016. The declaration makes federal funding available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures in Sussex County. Donald L. Keldsen has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made based on further damage assessments.
