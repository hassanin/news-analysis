The Administration supports the passage of H.J. Res. 111, a joint resolution that would nullify the "Arbitration Agreements" rule issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The rule would prevent certain financial institutions from using arbitration clauses to restrict participation in class-action lawsuits. The Administration argues that the rule would benefit trial lawyers, harm consumers by denying them the benefits of arbitration, and increase costs for financial institutions. They also claim that the rule goes against the policy expressed by Congress in the Federal Arbitration Act. The Administration supports this resolution as part of their commitment to making regulation efficient and effective, and to restoring public accountability within financial regulatory agencies.
