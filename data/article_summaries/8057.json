President Biden has announced a National Month of Action to accelerate the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the United States. The goal is to have 70% of U.S. adults receive at least one shot by July 4th. The initiative will involve various stakeholders, including national organizations, local government leaders, community-based and faith-based partners, businesses, social media influencers, celebrities, athletes, colleges, young people, and volunteers. The President will highlight the efforts of businesses and organizations to promote equity and facilitate vaccination. The Vice President will lead a National Vaccination Tour to encourage vaccinations in key communities. The administration aims to make it easier to get vaccinated, promote vaccine education and outreach, and incentivize vaccination. The U.S. has made significant progress in fighting the pandemic, with 63% of adult Americans already vaccinated. However, millions of Americans still need protection against the virus. The National Month of Action will include initiatives such as making it easier to get vaccinated, advancing equity, mobilizing the country for vaccination education and outreach, and incentivizing vaccination through business incentives and other means.
