President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring May 6, 2016, as Military Spouse Appreciation Day. The proclamation recognizes the sacrifices made by military spouses and emphasizes the need to give them the respect, dignity, and support they deserve. The Joining Forces initiative, launched by First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden, aims to provide military spouses with good, secure jobs. The proclamation also mentions efforts to address barriers that prevent transitioning service members and their spouses from finding better economic opportunities. President Obama encourages people to visit the Joining Forces website for more information on how to get involved. The proclamation concludes by calling upon the people of the United States to honor military spouses through appropriate ceremonies and activities.
