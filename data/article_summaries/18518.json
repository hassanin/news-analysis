On June 16, 2006, President Obama declared a national emergency in response to the actions and policies of certain members of the Belarusian government who were undermining democratic processes and institutions. This declaration allowed for measures to be taken, such as blocking the property of individuals involved in these activities. The President took this action due to the threat these actions posed to national security and foreign policy. In 2011, the government of Belarus continued to crack down on political opposition, civil society, and independent media. They arrested, detained, and imprisoned citizens for criticizing officials or participating in demonstrations, and prevented independent media from disseminating information. These actions demonstrated a regression in democratic governance and respect for human rights. As a result, the national emergency declared in 2006 and the measures taken at that time must continue beyond June 16, 2012. President Obama has thus decided to extend the national emergency for another year in accordance with the National Emergencies Act.
