This article is a notice from President Barack Obama regarding the annual renewal of the national emergency with respect to the situation in or in relation to Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast). The national emergency was declared on February 7, 2006, in response to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the situation in Côte d'Ivoire. The President ordered measures to block the property of certain individuals contributing to the conflict in the country. The situation in Côte d'Ivoire has resulted in civilian massacres, human rights abuses, political violence, and attacks against international peacekeeping forces. The President has determined that the national emergency must continue beyond February 7, 2011, as the situation still poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2006 will be continued for another year. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
