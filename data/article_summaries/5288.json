Governor McMaster of South Carolina has signed an extreme abortion ban into law, which could criminalize healthcare providers and lead to delays and denials of necessary care. This ban, along with similar ones in other states, threatens women's rights and endangers their health and lives. South Carolina's ban will limit access to abortion not only for women in the state but also for those in neighboring regions who rely on South Carolina for healthcare. President Biden and Vice President Harris believe that reproductive healthcare should be protected nationwide and will urge Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade and oppose Republican attempts to undermine fundamental freedoms.
