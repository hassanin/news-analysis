During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre introduced Jen Klein, the Director of the White House Gender Policy Council, to discuss President Biden's executive order on reproductive rights. The order safeguards access to reproductive health services, protects patient privacy, promotes safety and security for patients and providers, and coordinates federal efforts to protect reproductive rights and access to healthcare. Klein emphasized that the President is taking immediate action to defend reproductive rights and that the administration will continue to evaluate all options and steps that can be taken to protect women's rights. The press briefing also touched on other topics such as sick leave for federal employees, the Hyde Amendment, Medicaid coverage for travel, frustration among abortion rights supporters, and protests outside of the Supreme Court. The briefing concluded with discussions about the President's upcoming meeting with the Mexican President, gas prices, and the January 6th hearings.
