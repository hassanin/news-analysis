The article is a statement from the White House Press Secretary expressing disappointment and frustration with Senate Republicans who filibustered the nomination of Chuck Hagel as Secretary of Defense. The statement emphasizes that Hagel is a qualified candidate, a member of their own party, and a decorated combat veteran. The Press Secretary argues that a clear majority in the Senate supports Hagel's confirmation and that the filibuster goes against both the Senate's majority will and the nation's interest.

The Press Secretary calls for an end to the political games and for an up or down vote on Hagel's nomination.
