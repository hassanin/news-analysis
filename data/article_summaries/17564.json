President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Maine due to a severe winter storm, snowstorm, and flooding that occurred in February 2013. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, snow assistance, and hazard mitigation measures. James N. Russo has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and further designations may be made if requested by the state and warranted by damage assessments.
