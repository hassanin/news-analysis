Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Jake Sullivan called Dr. Monica Juma to congratulate her on being appointed as Kenya's first-ever National Security Advisor. They discussed their concerns about the escalating conflict in northern Ethiopia and the worsening humanitarian crisis. Sullivan urged the Government of Ethiopia and Tigrayan regional authorities to agree on an immediate cessation of hostilities, unhindered access for humanitarian assistance, Eritrea's withdrawal, and accountability for human rights violations. They also expressed concern about the devastating drought in the Horn of Africa, with the United States providing over $2 billion in response to the crisis. Sullivan and Juma reaffirmed the close partnership between the United States and Kenya and pledged to deepen cooperation on regional and global challenges.
