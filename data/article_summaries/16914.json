On September 16, 2009, President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama hosted an event at the White House to promote Chicago's bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics and highlight the administration's commitment to service, healthy living, and youth sport. The event was organized by the White House Office on Olympic, Paralympic and Youth Sport, Chicago2016, and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC). Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, representatives from Chicago2016, the USOC, United States Olympians and Paralympians, and schoolchildren from local DC area schools were also present. The event focused on discussing the ideals of the Olympic movement and the administration's commitment to service and expanding access to healthy, constructive activities like sports for children. Olympic athletes visited DC area schools in the morning as part of the Athlete Ambassador program, engaging youth in sport activities. After the President and First Lady's remarks at the White House, Chicago2016 representatives and the Olympic and Paralympic athletes conducted sports demonstrations. The First Lady, who was born and raised on the South Side of Chicago, will lead the delegation to support Chicago's bid at the host city election in Copenhagen on October 2, 2009.
