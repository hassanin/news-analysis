The United States expresses its willingness to work with Egypt's newly elected President, Abdelfattah al-Sisi, to strengthen the strategic partnership between the two countries. President Obama plans to speak with President-elect al-Sisi in the near future. International observers have concluded that the election was conducted professionally and in accordance with Egyptian laws. However, concerns have been raised about the restrictive political environment in which the election took place. The US urges the Egyptian government to ensure freedom of assembly, association, and expression, as well as due process rights for all Egyptians. The government is also encouraged to consider the recommendations of observer groups to improve the administration of future elections. While elections are important, true democracy requires the rule of law, civil liberties, and open political discourse. The US calls on the President-elect and the government to implement necessary reforms to govern with accountability, transparency, and a commitment to protecting the rights of all Egyptians. The US fully supports the democratic aspirations of the Egyptian people and promises to stand with them as they pursue a future that upholds dignity, justice, and political and economic opportunity.
