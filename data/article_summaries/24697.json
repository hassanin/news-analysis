This article is a Presidential Memorandum from July 15, 2013, discussing the expansion of national service through partnerships to advance government priorities. The Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) has been leading and expanding national service for the past 20 years. The memorandum highlights the six focus areas of national service: emergency and disaster services, economic opportunity, education, environmental stewardship, healthy futures, and veterans and military families. It emphasizes the positive impacts of national service, such as gaining valuable skills and jumpstarting careers. The memorandum establishes a Task Force on Expanding National Service, which includes representatives from various agencies and offices. The Task Force's mission is to identify policies and practices that support the expansion of national service, coordinate national service programs across the Federal Government, develop partnerships, utilize innovation and technology, and evaluate the effectiveness of national service interventions. The agencies on the Task Force are directed to consult with CNCS to enter into interagency and public-private partnerships for national service opportunities. The Office of Personnel Management is instructed to issue guidance on developing recruitment strategies for national service participants in civilian career services. The memorandum concludes with general provisions and authorization for the Chief Executive Officer of CNCS to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
