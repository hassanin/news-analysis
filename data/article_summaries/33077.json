First Lady Melania Trump embarked on a week-long trip to Africa as part of her Be Best initiative. She visited four countries - Ghana, Malawi, Kenya, and Egypt - in just five days. During her visits, she encouraged children to "Be Best" in their individual paths and emphasized the importance of social, emotional, and physical health. Mrs. Trump also had the opportunity to learn about the unique culture and traditions of each country. In Ghana, she visited a hospital and donated baby items. In Malawi, she focused on education and visited a primary school, donating soccer balls and other classroom supplies. In Kenya, she toured a national park, visited a children's home, and met with the President and First Lady. Finally, in Egypt, she emphasized the importance of supporting children worldwide and visited cultural sites such as the Sphinx and the Great Pyramid.
