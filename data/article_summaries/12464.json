The Presidential Memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama in 2015, addresses the issue of underinvestment in infrastructure in the United States. It highlights the need for increased collaboration between the public and private sectors to increase investment in infrastructure. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of predevelopment activities, which include project planning, feasibility studies, engineering, financial planning, permitting, environmental review, and public outreach. These activities are crucial in determining which infrastructure projects will move forward and how they will be funded. The memorandum directs various government departments and agencies to support predevelopment activities by providing grants, technical assistance, and regulatory changes. It also calls for the development of guidance and training programs to clarify funding options and best practices for predevelopment activities. The memorandum aims to encourage public-private collaboration, facilitate innovative infrastructure projects, and improve overall project outcomes.
