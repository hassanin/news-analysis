President Biden hosted a meeting with 10 electric utility executives at the White House to discuss his Build Back Better (BBB) agenda. These executives, who collectively employ over a hundred thousand Americans and provide power to more than 50 million homes and businesses, expressed their support for the climate and clean energy investments proposed in BBB. The President and the CEOs discussed how BBB would create good jobs, lower energy bills, improve the reliability of the electric grid, enhance U.S. competitiveness, stimulate economic growth, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The CEOs also emphasized that while they may not agree with every aspect of the President's agenda, they fully support investments in climate and clean energy. The provisions in BBB aim to invest in energy innovation, improve the reliability of the electric grid through transmission investments, and support the increasing number of electric vehicles in the country. These investments align with President Biden's goal of achieving 100% clean electricity by 2035. The President expressed his appreciation for the partnership of these electric utility CEOs in pursuing these goals.
