The Biden-Harris Administration has released a Housing Supply Action Plan aimed at closing the housing supply gap in the United States within five years. The plan includes legislative and administrative actions to boost the supply of quality housing, starting with the creation and preservation of hundreds of thousands of affordable housing units in the next three years. The goal is to make housing more affordable and attainable for Americans in every community. The plan focuses on building and preserving rental housing for low- and moderate-income families, as well as increasing homeownership opportunities. The administration is urging Congress to pass investments in housing production and preservation, which could finance close to 1 million affordable homes. The plan also addresses issues such as land use and zoning reform, reducing regulatory barriers, and improving financing options for housing production and preservation. Additionally, the administration aims to preserve the availability of affordable single-family homes for owner-occupants and address constraints related to materials costs and labor supply in the construction industry.
