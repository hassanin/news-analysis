President Joe Biden has proclaimed October 15th as Blind Americans Equality Day to honor the contributions of blind and visually impaired Americans. He highlights the impact of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in improving the lives of blind individuals by providing opportunities for employment, independent living, and equal participation in society. The President has signed executive orders to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion within the federal workforce, including raising the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 an hour. His administration is also providing funding opportunities to promote competitive integrated employment for disabled workers. Additionally, $20 million has been awarded through the Randolph-Sheppard Vending Facilities Program to assist blind entrepreneurs and create vending opportunities on federal property. President Biden emphasizes the importance of education in advancing equity and opportunity, particularly for children who are blind and visually impaired. The American Rescue Plan has allocated over $3 billion to support special education and related services for children with disabilities. The President is working with Congress to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to ensure tailored education for disabled students. The proclamation calls for appropriate programs and activities to celebrate Blind Americans Equality Day.
