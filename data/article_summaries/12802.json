The article is a message from President Barack Obama to the Senate of the United States regarding an extradition treaty between the US and Chile. The President transmits the treaty for the Senate's advice and consent to ratification. The treaty aims to replace an outdated extradition treaty from 1900 and follows the form and content of other recent extradition treaties. It includes a "dual criminality" approach, allowing for extradition of offenses like money laundering that were not covered in the previous treaty. The treaty also modernizes the "political offense" clause and ensures that extradition cannot be refused based on nationality. Additionally, the treaty incorporates procedural improvements to streamline and expedite the extradition process. President Obama recommends that the Senate consider and ratify the treaty.
