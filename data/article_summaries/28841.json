The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released its monthly Employment Situation Report, showing strong wage growth and steady employment growth. In August, the economy added 130,000 jobs, with an average pace of job growth of 173,000 jobs per month over the past year. The job growth is nearly ten times higher than what was anticipated by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) prior to the 2016 election. In total, the economy has added over 6.3 million jobs since President Trump was elected, surpassing the CBO's predictions. The labor market remains strong, with job gains exceeding 100,000 jobs in 30 of the 33 months since the President was elected. The professional and business services sector and the education and health services industry saw the largest job growth in August. Manufacturing jobs also increased. Wages continued to grow, with nominal average hourly earnings rising by 3.2 percent over the past 12 months. Real wage growth is also evident when accounting for inflation. The unemployment rate remained at 3.7 percent in August, with African American and Hispanic unemployment rates reaching record lows. The labor force participation rate and the employment-population ratio both increased, indicating a strong labor market. The Trump Administration's pro-growth policies are credited with moving workers off the sidelines and contributing to a prosperous economy. Overall, the August employment data show a strong American economy with robust wage growth, low unemployment, and strong job gains.
