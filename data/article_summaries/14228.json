On August 1, 2010, President Obama signed H.R. 5900, also known as the "Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010," into law. This legislation extends the collection of taxes that fund the Airport and Airway Trust Fund and provides grants to airports under the Airport Improvement Program until September 30, 2010. Additionally, it introduces several requirements regarding commercial scheduled air carrier safety and pilot training. These requirements include addressing pilot fatigue and establishing an electronic pilot records database.
