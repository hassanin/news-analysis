In a call with Russian President Putin, President Obama expressed concern about Russia's support for armed, pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. He urged Putin to use his influence to convince these groups to leave the buildings they have seized. Obama also emphasized the importance of Russia withdrawing its troops from Ukraine's border to ease tensions. He praised Ukraine's restraint and efforts to unify the country through free and fair elections and constitutional reform. Obama warned that Russia's actions would lead to increasing costs and isolation. He mentioned the upcoming contact group meeting in Geneva and stressed that a diplomatic solution is still possible, but not in an environment of Russian military intimidation, armed provocation, and escalatory rhetoric.
