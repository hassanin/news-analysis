Sixty years ago, a quarter of a million people gathered in Washington to demand jobs, freedom, and equality. The march was led by Martin Luther King Jr. and John Lewis, who spoke about the importance of voting rights. The event inspired the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, but the fight for civil rights continued afterward and still continues today. Presently, there are attempts to roll back progress on voting rights, reproductive freedom, and LGBTQ+ equality, so Americans are fighting for justice and equity. On this anniversary, it is important to recommit to the fight for equality, opportunity, and justice, and to protect foundational freedoms such as the right to vote, women's reproductive rights, and freedom from hate and violence.
