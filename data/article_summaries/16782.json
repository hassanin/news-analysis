The Obama Administration has finalized fuel efficiency standards that will increase the average fuel economy of cars and light-duty trucks to 54.5 mpg by 2025. This move will almost double the fuel efficiency of new vehicles compared to those currently on the road. The national program to improve fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions is expected to save consumers over $1.7 trillion at the gas pump and reduce U.S. oil consumption by 12 billion barrels. These standards are seen as a significant step in reducing dependence on foreign oil and strengthening the nation's energy security. The standards were developed in collaboration with automakers, consumer groups, environmental and energy experts, and the public. The new standards will encourage innovation and investment in advanced technologies, support domestic jobs in the auto industry, and help curb pollution. The combined efforts of the Obama Administration will save American families over $1.7 trillion in fuel costs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks by 50% by 2025.
