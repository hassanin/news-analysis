President Biden hosted the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity Leaders' Summit, which included the leaders of 11 other countries in the Americas. The summit aimed to strengthen regional competitiveness and promote high-standard investment in the hemisphere. The leaders announced plans to drive inclusive growth and strengthen critical supply chains, with a focus on clean energy, semiconductors, and medical supplies. The United States is providing nearly $485 million to assist migrants, refugees, and vulnerable populations in the Western Hemisphere. The Americas Partnership is collaborating with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to bring together regional leaders from various sectors to build more competitive and resilient value chains. President Biden is also working to strengthen the IDB by developing new financing tools and deploying new funds.
