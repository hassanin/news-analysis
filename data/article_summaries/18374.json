President Barack Obama has issued a notice to continue the national emergency with respect to Iran. The national emergency was originally declared on November 14, 1979, due to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the situation in Iran. As relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal and the process of implementing agreements with Iran is still ongoing, the national emergency will continue beyond November 14, 2010. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
