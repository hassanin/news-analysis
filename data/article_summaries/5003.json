President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed July 27, 2022, as National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day. This day is dedicated to honoring the strength, sacrifices, and sense of duty of the Korean War veterans. The United States joined forces with the Republic of Korea in 1950 to fight against the communist regime in North Korea and the People's Republic of China. After three years of combat, an armistice was signed, leading to nearly 70 years of peace and a strong relationship between the Korean and American people. The Republic of Korea has since become a thriving democracy and global center of innovation. The U.S.-ROK Alliance is evolving to maintain peace and stability in the region and expanding to the global stage. During the Korean War, 1.8 million Americans served, facing challenges and sacrificing their lives to defend freedom and democracy. Over 36,000 American service members were killed in action, along with thousands of Korean soldiers. Many were held captive, and thousands remain unaccounted for. The President and First Lady are committed to accounting for all prisoners of war and missing in action and caring for veterans and their families. On National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, Americans are encouraged to reflect on the veterans' contributions and honor them with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
