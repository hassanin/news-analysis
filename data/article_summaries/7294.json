The Biden Administration has facilitated the air shipment of approximately 1.4 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Nestl√© Gerber Good Start Extensive HA formula on September 29. This was done through Operation Fly Formula, a program launched by President Biden to speed up the import of infant formula and ensure its availability in stores, hospitals, and home health care providers. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the General Services Administration (GSA), and the Department of Defense (DOD) are partnering to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S. health and safety standards and transport it to the U.S. market. The Biden Administration has also invoked the Defense Production Act, reached a consent agreement with Abbott Nutrition to reopen their facility, and issued FDA guidance to allow major formula manufacturers to import formula that is not currently produced for the U.S. market.
