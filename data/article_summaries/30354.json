Second Lady Karen Pence, along with Leah Esper, the wife of the Secretary of Defense, visited U.S. Army Fort Campbell to show appreciation for military spouses. Pence emphasized the important role that spouses play in the strength of the United States Army, acknowledging the challenges they face in finding employment. Currently, 34% of military spouses work in fields that require a state license, and they experience a 24% unemployment rate. Pence highlighted the efforts of the Trump Administration in addressing these challenges, including the National Defense Authorization Act, which provided a 3.1% pay raise for service members and increased reimbursement costs for relicensing and recertification. The law also allowed military spouses to retain their state of residency for business purposes if they move due to a change of station. Pence spoke to military spouses, participated in a military briefing, and visited the Intrepid Spirit Center's art therapy program for traumatic brain injury identification and recovery. She launched a campaign in September 2018 to honor military spouses and advocate for more fulfilling career opportunities for them.
