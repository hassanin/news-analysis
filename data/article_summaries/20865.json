President Obama has issued a statement on the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) reached with Israel, reaffirming America's commitment to Israel's security. The MOU, a 10-year agreement, represents the largest pledge of military assistance in US history, totaling $38 billion. This includes $33 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) funds and an additional $5 billion for missile defense. The President believes that the continued supply of advanced weapons technology will help Israel defend itself in a dangerous neighborhood. He also emphasizes the long-standing commitment of the US to Israel's security and the welfare of the Israeli people. However, he acknowledges the need for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, despite challenges on the ground. The President believes that a viable and independent Palestine is necessary for Israel to thrive as a Jewish and democratic state. The MOU and efforts for a two-state solution are driven by the objective of ensuring peace and security for Israelis and their neighbors.
