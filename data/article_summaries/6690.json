On board Air Force One en route to Geneva, Switzerland, a senior administration official provided an overview of the logistics for the upcoming meeting between President Biden and President Putin. The Swiss President will greet both leaders upon their arrival at the villa where the meeting will take place. The three leaders will share a short greeting and then go outside for a brief moment with the press, during which only the Swiss President will speak. They will then move inside for a smaller meeting with the Secretary of State as the "plus one" on the U.S. side. Afterward, there will be an expanded portion of the meeting with additional participants. The exact duration of the meeting is uncertain, but it is expected to last several hours. Following the meeting, President Putin is expected to hold a press conference, followed by President Biden. The senior administration official emphasized that they are not providing many details in advance and will let the presidents speak for themselves after the meeting. The official also mentioned that the return of ambassadors between the U.S. and Russia is a possibility. The main objectives of the meeting are to establish areas of cooperation, define American national interests, and communicate the President's vision for American values. The President has been preparing for the meeting by reviewing written material, engaging with advisors, and consulting with experts on Russia. He also met with leaders from Baltic countries to show solidarity with NATO allies and gather their advice on dealing with Putin. It is unclear if President Biden speaks any Russian.
