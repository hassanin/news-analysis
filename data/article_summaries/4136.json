The United States, along with more than 30 partners, has implemented extensive sanctions and export controls to hold President Putin accountable for his actions in Ukraine. These measures aim to restrict Russia's access to critical technology and make it a global financial pariah. As a result, the Russian economy is suffering, with a projected decline in GDP, high inflation, and the loss of many U.S. and multinational businesses. The United States and its allies are committed to supporting Ukraine and ensuring that Russia feels the economic consequences of their actions. Today, the United States has taken further steps to crack down on evasion and tighten sanctions to increase pressure on Putin and his supporters.
