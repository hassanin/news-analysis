The article discusses the conclusions of the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) conducted by the US Administration. The review acknowledges that while the US has tried to reduce the number and role of nuclear weapons, other countries have increased their nuclear stockpiles and developed new capabilities. The NPR emphasizes the importance of modernizing the US nuclear infrastructure and developing capabilities that make the use of nuclear weapons less likely. It also reaffirms the commitment to arms control, nuclear non-proliferation, and preventing nuclear terrorism.
