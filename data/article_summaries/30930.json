President Trump welcomed Secretary General Stoltenberg of NATO to the White House to discuss the upcoming NATO Summit in July. Trump commended the progress made in increasing member-state contributions to defense spending, with last year seeing the largest increase in defense spending among European member states and Canada in 25 years. However, Trump emphasized that more work needs to be done, as 20 member states have not yet met their NATO commitments to spend at least 2 percent of GDP on defense. He particularly called on Germany to address its longstanding shortfall in defense contributions. Trump also discussed the importance of NATO's role in counterterrorism efforts and in stopping nuclear proliferation. He expressed his commitment to finding a peaceful solution to the crisis on the Korean Peninsula and to halting Iran's nuclear ambitions. Trump reiterated the need for fairness and reciprocity among NATO member states. Secretary General Stoltenberg expressed his gratitude for Trump's leadership in increasing defense spending and highlighted the progress made by all allies in increasing their defense budgets. He also expressed support for Trump's efforts in Syria and the Korean Peninsula, and emphasized the importance of NATO's role in fighting terrorism and maintaining global security.
