President Donald Trump has issued a memorandum identifying several countries as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries for Fiscal Year 2019. The countries listed include Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. The presence of a country on this list does not necessarily reflect its government's counternarcotics efforts or level of cooperation with the United States. Additionally, President Trump has designated Bolivia and Venezuela as countries that have failed to adhere to international counternarcotics agreements and take the required measures. The memorandum also emphasizes the United States' commitment to combating the opioid epidemic and calls for stronger efforts from countries where illicit drugs originate and transit. The designation will be submitted to Congress and published in the Federal Register.
