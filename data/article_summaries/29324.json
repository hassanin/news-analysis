The United States has expressed gratitude to the Maduro regime for releasing Joshua Holt, an unjustly detained American citizen, and his Venezuelan wife. However, this release does not change the United States' policy towards Venezuela. The Maduro regime is urged to hold free, fair, and transparent elections in accordance with the country's constitution. The recent election process on May 20 was deemed illegitimate. The regime must also release all political prisoners and accept international humanitarian aid for the suffering citizens of Venezuela. The United States will continue to use various measures to pressure the Maduro regime to uphold democratic norms and will work to form an international coalition that supports the return of democracy to Venezuela.
