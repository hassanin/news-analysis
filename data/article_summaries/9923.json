President Barack Obama has proclaimed October 9th as Leif Erikson Day in honor of the Norse explorer who was the first known European to reach North America. The proclamation recognizes the courageous spirit and exploration of Leif Erikson and his crew, who established the first European settlement in present-day Canada over 1,000 years ago. It also highlights the contributions of Norwegian immigrants to the United States, who arrived in New York City in 1825 and opened doors of opportunity for future generations. The proclamation encourages Americans to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities to celebrate the Nordic-American heritage. It also emphasizes the need for continued exploration and innovation in various fields.
