This executive order, issued on September 26, 2019, addresses the resettlement of refugees in the United States. The purpose of the order is to establish a policy that promotes cooperation and consultation with state and local governments in the resettlement process. The order emphasizes the importance of considering the preferences of state governments and aims to provide a pathway for refugees to become self-sufficient.

The order directs the Secretary of State to determine the extent to which state and local jurisdictions can have greater involvement in the placement or resettlement of refugees. It also requires the development of a process to determine whether both the state and locality consent to the resettlement of refugees within their jurisdiction. Written consents of states and localities must be publicly released.

The order further states that if a state or locality does not provide consent for refugee resettlement, refugees should not be resettled there unless the Secretary of State determines that not doing so would be inconsistent with established policies and strategies. The Secretary must notify the President of such a decision, along with the reasons for it.

The order does not affect the authority of executive departments or agencies, nor does it create any enforceable rights or benefits. It is to be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
