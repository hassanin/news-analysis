On June 2, 2009, President Barack Obama signed into law H.R. 131, which established the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission. The purpose of the commission was to plan, develop, and carry out activities to honor Ronald Reagan on the 100th anniversary of his birth. The commission was composed of the Secretary of the Interior, four individuals appointed by President Obama based on recommendations from the Board of Trustees of the Ronald Reagan Foundation, and six members of Congress appointed by the congressional leadership. President Obama welcomed the participation of Congress members in the commission's activities but clarified that their involvement would be limited to ceremonial or advisory functions and not in matters involving the administration of the act, in order to adhere to the separation of powers and the Constitution.
