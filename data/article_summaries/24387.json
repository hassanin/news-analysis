President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation to establish the Waco Mammoth National Monument in Waco, Texas. The monument is created to preserve and protect the remains of Columbian Mammoths and other animals from the late Pleistocene Epoch, including a unique discovery of a nursery herd of mammoths. The excavation area, as well as the surrounding land, offers opportunities for further exploration and research. The City of Waco, Baylor University, and the Waco Mammoth Foundation will continue to manage and oversee the site in partnership with the National Park Service. The Secretary of the Interior will develop a management plan for the monument within three years. The proclamation ensures that the monument's resources are preserved and protected while also providing opportunities for research, education, and enjoyment by the public.
