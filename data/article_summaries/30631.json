President Donald J. Trump met with Congressman Elijah Cummings to discuss rising prescription drug prices. The meeting was a result of a previous conversation where they found common ground. Trump expressed his desire to work with Cummings in a bipartisan manner to make prescription drugs more affordable, especially for those who need life-saving medications. They discussed reforming the Food and Drug Administration and reducing regulatory burdens on drug manufacturers to enhance competition. Trump also offered his condolences to Cummings and his staffer, Katie Malone, who lost six children in a house fire in January.
