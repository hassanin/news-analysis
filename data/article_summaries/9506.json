This article discusses a joint statement from Belgium, France, Germany, the Republic of Korea, and the United States regarding their collaboration on the development of high-density low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel. The parties recognize the importance of minimizing highly-enriched uranium (HEU) in civilian use for nuclear security. They are working together to convert research reactors from HEU fuel to LEU fuel by developing and qualifying new high-density LEU fuels. The focus is on uranium molybdenum (UMo), both as a monolithic fuel foil and as UMo powder dispersed in an aluminum matrix. The parties express confidence in their cooperation and agree to share the benefits of the technology developed in this joint effort.
