President Barack Obama has proclaimed May 2015 as Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. In his proclamation, he recognizes the rich heritage and contributions of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders in the United States. He highlights the perseverance and determination of this community throughout history, from the immigrants who arrived on Angel Island to the laborers who helped connect the coasts by rail. He also acknowledges the struggles and discrimination that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders continue to face, such as barriers to education, employment, and healthcare, as well as the violence and harassment faced by South Asian Americans. President Obama reaffirms his commitment to addressing these issues and creating opportunities for increased access and involvement in federal programs. He also mentions his efforts to pass comprehensive immigration reform and his administration's commitment to hosting the White House Summit on AAPIs. The proclamation encourages all Americans to learn more about the efforts on behalf of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and to observe the month with appropriate programs and activities.
