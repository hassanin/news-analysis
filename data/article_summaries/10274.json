On December 23, 2009, President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13525, which adjusted the rates of pay for various positions within the United States government. The order included schedules outlining the rates of basic pay for different pay systems, such as the General Schedule and the Foreign Service Schedule. It also established the ranges of rates of basic pay for senior executives in the Senior Executive Service. Additionally, the order set the rates of basic pay for positions such as the Vice President, members of Congress, and justices and judges. It also addressed the rates of monthly basic pay for members of the uniformed services and the rate of monthly cadet or midshipman pay. The order further specified that locality-based comparability payments would be made in accordance with a specific schedule and that administrative law judges would receive adjusted rates of basic pay. The order went into effect on January 1, 2010, superseding a previous executive order.
