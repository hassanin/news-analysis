The Trump Administration has announced the release of two regulations that aim to give patients greater access to and control over their healthcare information. The regulations, the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access final rule and the ONC 21st Century Cures Act final rule, ensure that patients can view their entire health record and securely share it with family members and healthcare providers of their choice. The rules also promote the use of technology such as application programming interfaces (APIs) to facilitate data exchange between doctors and patients. Starting from January 1, 2021, patients can request secure access to their health information via the Patient Access API. This development will benefit patients who find it difficult to travel or live in rural areas with limited access to care. The reforms prioritize patients over paperwork and aim to improve healthcare outcomes at lower costs. The regulations also emphasize the importance of maintaining the privacy and security of patient information, with additional steps being taken to protect patient data and educate patients about sharing health information with third parties. The Trump Administration is committed to working with all stakeholders to ensure patients have access to the information they need and to promote medical innovation.
