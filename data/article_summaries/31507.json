In a speech given at General Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee, President Trump expressed his frustration with Obamacare and the obstruction by congressional Democrats to repeal and replace the healthcare law. He was joined by two families, Michael and Tammy Kushman, and Robert and Sarah Stoll, who have been negatively impacted by Obamacare. The Kushmans saw their premiums increase from $600 to over $1,400 per month, and the Stolls had their premiums double and were forced to repay thousands of dollars due to changes in their income. Trump emphasized the need for a solution to provide American families with quality, reliable, and affordable healthcare, but acknowledged the difficulty in getting support from Democrats. He expressed his commitment to finding a solution and thanked the families for sharing their stories.
