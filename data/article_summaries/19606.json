In a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney announced the Summer Jobs Plus program, which calls for businesses, nonprofits, and government to work together to provide employment opportunities for low-income and disconnected youth. The program aims to create nearly 180,000 employment opportunities for low-income youth, 70,000 of which are paid jobs or internships. Carney also discussed the fallout from the recess appointments made by President Obama, stating that the President firmly believes he has the constitutional authority to make these appointments. He also addressed concerns about the impact of the appointments on future cooperation with Congress. Carney emphasized the need to protect consumers and workers, citing the appointment of Richard Cordray as the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the appointment of members to the National Labor Relations Board. He also discussed the President's focus on job creation and economic growth, his commitment to working with Congress, and the importance of keeping all energy focused on creating jobs and growing the economy.
