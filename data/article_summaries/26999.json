On April 26, 2017, President Donald Trump issued an executive order titled "Enforcing Statutory Prohibitions on Federal Control of Education." The order aims to restore the division of power between the Federal Government and the States and ensure compliance with statutes that prohibit federal interference with state and local control over education. The policy outlined in the order is to protect and preserve state and local control over the curriculum, program of instruction, administration, and personnel of educational institutions. The Secretary of Education is instructed to review all Department of Education regulations and guidance documents related to education laws and determine if they comply with federal laws that restrict federal control over areas under state and local control. Any regulations or guidance documents found to be inconsistent with statutory prohibitions are to be rescinded or revised. The term "guidance document" is defined as any written statement issued by the Department that sets forth a policy or interpretation of a statutory or regulatory issue. The order does not impair the authority of executive departments or agencies or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It is to be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. The order does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
