The article is a presidential order issued by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. of the United States. The order amends Executive Order 14024 and Executive Order 14068, which were previously issued to address the national emergency declared in relation to the Russian Federation's actions that undermine United States national security. The amendments authorize the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with other relevant departments, to impose sanctions on foreign financial institutions that conduct significant transactions for designated individuals or entities operating in sectors of the Russian Federation's economy that support its military-industrial base. The sanctions include prohibiting the opening or maintenance of accounts in the United States and blocking property and interests in property. The order also imposes import restrictions on certain products of Russian Federation origin and provides additional definitions and regulations related to the implementation of the orders. The order states that it is intended to be consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
