President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Illinois due to severe storms and flooding that occurred between July 22 and August 7, 2010. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The funding will provide assistance to individuals and businesses, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Hazard mitigation measures will also be funded on a cost-sharing basis statewide. Gregory W. Eaton has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance through DisasterAssistance.gov or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week until further notice.
