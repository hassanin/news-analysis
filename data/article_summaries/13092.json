President Obama has announced his vision for investing in America's transportation infrastructure. He plans to launch a competition for $600 million in transportation funding and propose a $302 billion, four-year surface transportation reauthorization. The President wants to promote job growth in the transportation sector and work with Congress to ensure critical transportation programs are funded. He also plans to dedicate $150 billion in one-time transition revenue from business tax reform to address the funding crisis facing transportation programs. Additionally, the President is proposing a $302 billion, four-year transportation reauthorization bill that will provide stable funding for highways, bridges, transit, and rail systems. The plan includes prioritizing "Fix-it-First" investments, matching transportation infrastructure investments to current and future needs, and expanding economic growth, jobs, and opportunity. The President also aims to boost efficiency and taxpayers' return on transportation investments by improving project delivery and the regulatory review process, building more resilient communities, and attracting private investment in transportation infrastructure.
