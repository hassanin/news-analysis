On May 15, 2019, President Donald Trump issued an Executive Order declaring a national emergency to address the threat posed by the unrestricted acquisition or use of information and communications technology (ICT) or services in the United States by foreign adversaries. The order states that foreign adversaries are exploiting vulnerabilities in ICT to commit malicious cyber-enabled actions, including economic and industrial espionage against the United States. While maintaining an open investment climate is important, the order emphasizes the need to protect national security. The Executive Order prohibits certain transactions involving ICT or services if the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other relevant agencies, determines that the transaction involves ICT or services designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a foreign adversary and poses risks to the security, resiliency, or national security of the United States. The Secretary is authorized to take necessary actions to implement the Executive Order, and all agencies are directed to carry out its provisions.
