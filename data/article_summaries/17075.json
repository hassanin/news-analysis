This statement by the President is about the passing of a budget by both parties in Congress. The budget aims to reverse some of the damaging sequester cuts that have affected students, seniors, and businesses. It also allows for investments in education and research to strengthen the economy and middle class. The budget will continue to reduce deficits and prevent another government shutdown. The President urges Congress to pass an extension of unemployment insurance to support Americans looking for jobs. The President thanks the leaders from both parties for their work and hopes for continued cooperation in the future.
