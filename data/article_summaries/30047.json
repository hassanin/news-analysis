President Donald Trump promised to revitalize America's economy during his campaign, and his administration has been working towards that goal since day one. They have implemented policies such as tax cuts, deregulation, and promoting American energy production. The latest GDP numbers show a growth rate of 4.1 percent, which is seen as a sign that their agenda is working. Additionally, consumer confidence is at a 17-year high and nearly 3.7 million jobs have been added since the election. The administration aims to reach a 3 percent annual growth rate, which hasn't been achieved in 13 years. These results have exceeded expectations and proved critics wrong. The president will continue to focus on growing the economy and creating opportunities for all Americans.
