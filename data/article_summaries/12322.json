In this article, the Press Secretary discusses the ongoing crisis in the Central African Republic (CAR). The rebellion that began in 2012 has led to instability, lawlessness, and sectarian conflict. Over 2.5 million people in the country require humanitarian assistance, and one million have been displaced. To address this situation, President Obama has issued an Executive Order declaring a national emergency and authorizing sanctions. The order also sanctions five individuals who threaten the stability of CAR. The United States is working with international partners and CAR's transitional authorities to help the country recover. They support the efforts of African Union, French, and European Union forces, as well as UN peacekeepers. The US will continue to provide support to the Transitional Government, deliver humanitarian aid, and urge all parties to end the violence and work towards a brighter future for all Central Africans.
