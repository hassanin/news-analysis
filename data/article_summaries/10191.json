The United States congratulates the Sudanese people, the government of Sudan, and the government of Southern Sudan on the successful completion of their week-long referendum on the future of southern Sudan. The peaceful and orderly voting process was inspiring and a testament to the determination of the people and leaders of south Sudan. The United States commends the various organizations involved in overseeing the referendum and thanks the voters for their high turnout and positive attitude. While official results will take time to be released, independent observers have been encouraged by the credibility of the process so far. The United States urges all parties to remain calm and show restraint as they work towards implementing the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The United States will continue to support Sudan amid the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
