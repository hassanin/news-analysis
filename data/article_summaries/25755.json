The White House, Truth Initiative, and the Ad Council have launched a new ad campaign called "The Truth About Opioids" aimed at raising awareness about the dangers of opioid misuse among young adults. The campaign includes four ads featuring real stories of young people who became addicted to opioids and took extreme measures to obtain more pills. The goal is to educate young adults about the risks of opioid misuse and addiction and to encourage them to seek alternatives to opioids for pain management. The campaign is part of the administration's broader efforts to combat the opioid crisis, which has claimed the lives of thousands of Americans. The ads will be shown on various platforms, including television and social media. The campaign has received support and media donations from various partners, including Facebook, Google, YouTube, NBCU, Turner, Amazon, and VICE. The exact cost of the campaign has not been disclosed.
