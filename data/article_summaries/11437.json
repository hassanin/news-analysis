On July 16, 2009, President Barack Obama issued a notice to Congress regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the former Liberian regime of Charles Taylor. This emergency was initially declared on July 22, 2004, through Executive Order 13348. The President took this action to address the threat posed by the actions and policies of Charles Taylor and others, including the unlawful depletion of Liberian resources and the removal and secreting of Liberian funds and property. These actions undermined Liberia's transition to democracy and the development of its political, administrative, and economic institutions. The President also highlighted that the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and cease-fire had not been fully implemented in Liberia, and the illicit trade in round logs and timber products was linked to the proliferation of illegal arms and conflicts in West Africa. Due to the continued threat posed by these individuals, the national emergency and the measures adopted to address it were extended for one year beyond July 22, 2009. The notice was published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
