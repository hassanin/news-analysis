President Donald Trump has announced the formation of a Presidential Task Force on Protecting Native American Children in the Indian Health Service System. The task force is charged with investigating the institutional and systemic breakdown that allowed a predatory pediatrician to sexually assault children while working in the Indian Health Service. The task force will focus on identifying any systemic problems that contributed to the doctor's actions and will develop policies and protocols to prevent future abuse. It will be comprised of subject-matter experts from various government agencies and co-chaired by Joseph Grogan, Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and Trent Shores, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Oklahoma. The task force will also seek input from tribal leaders and Native American voices.
