The Biden Administration is focused on promoting an open, reliable, and secure internet, protecting human rights both online and offline, and supporting a global digital economy. However, there are certain countries, such as China, that do not share these values and use digital technologies and American data to advance their own interests while posing national security risks. To address this, President Biden signed an Executive Order (E.O.) to further address the national emergency declared in 2019 regarding the threat to the United States' information and communications technology and services (ICTS) supply chain.

This E.O. revokes and replaces three previous E.O.s that aimed to ban transactions with TikTok, WeChat, and eight other software applications. Instead, the new E.O. directs the Department of Commerce to evaluate software applications connected to foreign adversaries and take appropriate action. It also provides criteria for identifying and evaluating ICTS transactions involving these applications that may pose an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security. For example, applications owned or controlled by persons supporting foreign adversary military or intelligence activities, involved in malicious cyber activities, or collecting sensitive personal data may present a heightened risk.

Furthermore, the E.O. instructs the Department of Commerce to develop recommendations, in consultation with other U.S. departments and agencies, to protect against harm from the sale, transfer, or access to sensitive personal data by foreign adversaries. This includes recommendations for executive and legislative actions to address the risks associated with software applications connected to foreign adversaries.
