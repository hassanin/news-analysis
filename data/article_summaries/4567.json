During a teleconference, a senior administration official provided an update on President Biden's trip to the Middle East. The official mentioned that the purpose of the trip was to discuss the security and strategic priorities of the United States with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and other regional leaders. The official highlighted the importance of the United States' engagement in the Middle East and the need to prevent Russia, China, and Iran from filling any potential vacuums in the region.

The official also mentioned that there is evidence of ongoing Russian interest in acquiring Iranian attack-capable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which has implications for the security situation in the Middle East. The official emphasized the importance of the United States' bet on a more integrated, stable, and peaceful Middle East region.

During the summit, President Biden discussed various global challenges, including new diseases, food and energy security, and the climate crisis. The President also outlined five declaratory principles that will guide U.S. engagement in the Middle East: partnership, deterrence, diplomacy, integration, and values. The official emphasized that the United States is focused on realistic objectives that align with its interests and the interests of its partners, rather than pursuing regime change or nation-building.

As part of the summit, the United States committed $1 billion in new food security assistance for the Middle East and North Africa region. The GCC leaders also committed $3 billion over the next two years for projects that align with the U.S. Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) initiative. The official highlighted the importance of these initiatives in strengthening alliances, diversifying supply chains, and creating new opportunities for American workers and businesses.

Other key announcements included agreements between Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Jordan to bring affordable energy to Iraq and diversify its energy sources, as well as the signing of a landmark agreement between Iraq and the GCC Interconnection Authority to link Iraq's electricity grid to the grids in the GCC. This will help diversify Iraq's electricity sources, which are currently heavily reliant on gas from Iran.

The official also addressed questions about Russia's involvement in the region, the detention of a U.S. citizen by the UAE, and the role of values in U.S. foreign policy. The official emphasized that the United States remains committed to promoting human rights and values in its engagements with foreign leaders, while also pursuing strategic interests and tangible results.

Overall, the official highlighted the importance of partnerships, integration, and diplomacy in the Middle East region, and the unique role that the United States can play in fostering stability, security, and prosperity.
