In this statement, the President strongly condemns the violence committed by the Syrian government against peaceful protesters and also condemns any use of violence by protesters. The United States offers condolences to the victims' families and calls on the Syrian authorities to refrain from further violence. The President also calls for an end to arbitrary arrests, detention, and torture, as well as the free flow of information for independent verification of events. The Syrian people deserve a government that is responsive to their aspirations, including freedoms of expression, association, and peaceful assembly, confidence in the rule of law, and a transparent and corruption-free government. The Syrian government has not addressed the legitimate aspirations of its people, and it is time for them to stop repressing their citizens and listen to their calls for political and economic reforms.
