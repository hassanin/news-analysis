First Lady Melania Trump has announced a significant renewal of the White House Rose Garden. The project aims to improve the iconic location on the White House grounds by restoring its historic design. The final design plan, a collaboration between landscape architecture firms Perry Guillot, Inc and Oehme, van Sweden & Associates/OvS, will return the garden to its original 1962 footprint. Decades of use and necessary changes have taken a toll on the garden's elegance and symmetry. The restoration will also improve infrastructure, drainage, and the health of plantings. The plans include improved accessibility, utilities, and support for audiovisual and broadcasting needs. The project has gone through the approval process of the Committee for the Preservation of the White House and is supported by the National Park Service and funded by private donations. Melania Trump emphasizes the importance of preserving the history and beauty of the White House and its grounds for future generations.
