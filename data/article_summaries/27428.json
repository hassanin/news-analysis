The United States is pleased with the progress made by Ethiopia and Eritrea in resolving their longstanding disputes and normalizing relations. The conflict between these two countries has hindered stability and economic growth in the Red Sea region for the past 20 years. The US believes that a lasting peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea will bring greater prosperity and security not only to their citizens, but also to their neighbors and the world. The US commends Ethiopia for fully accepting the 2000 Algiers Agreement and welcomes Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki's commitment to send a delegation to Ethiopia to advance the peace process. The US sees Ethiopia and Eritrea as critical players in promoting stability and prosperity in the Horn of Africa, and looks forward to a full normalization of relations between the two countries. As a witness to the Algiers Agreement, the US is ready to facilitate progress towards this goal.
