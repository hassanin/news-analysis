The article from The New York Post titled "Turns out Trump didn't ruin America's economy" discusses how predictions about the negative impact of Donald Trump's presidency on the economy have proven to be false. The article mentions that foreign tourism to New York City is actually expected to rise this year, despite earlier claims that Trump's travel ban and rhetoric would result in a drop in visitors. The stock market has also seen significant growth since Trump took office, with the Dow climbing over 25 percent. The article argues that talk of Trump causing economic disaster is unfounded and not based in reality.
