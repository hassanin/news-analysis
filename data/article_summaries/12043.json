This article discusses an executive order signed by President Barack Obama to increase competition and provide better information to consumers and workers in order to support the growth of the American economy. The order emphasizes the importance of maintaining a fair and competitive marketplace and highlights certain practices that hinder competition, such as collusion and price fixing. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission are mentioned as agencies that work to detect and stop anticompetitive conduct. The order directs executive departments and agencies to use their authorities to promote competition, provide information to consumers and workers, and eliminate regulations that restrict competition. The agencies are required to submit an initial list of potential actions they can take to promote more competitive markets and address practices that restrict consumer or worker choice. They are also tasked with submitting recommendations on agency-specific actions within 60 days. The order encourages independent agencies to comply and states that it does not impair any existing authorities or create any enforceable rights or benefits.
