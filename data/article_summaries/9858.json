President Barack Obama has issued a presidential proclamation ordering that the flag of the United States be flown at half-staff as a mark of respect for Antonin Scalia, Associate Justice of the United States. The flag will be flown at half-staff at the White House, all public buildings and grounds, military posts, naval stations, naval vessels of the Federal Government, and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset on the day of interment. The same directive applies to all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including military facilities and naval vessels and stations.
