The PMAB is scheduled to terminate two years after the date of the executive order, unless extended by the President. The order clarifies that it does not affect the authority of executive departments or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Additionally, it states that the order does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
