The senior administration officials gave an embargoed preview of a step that will be announced the next day to protect the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure. The administration's approach to cybersecurity has three lines of effort: modernizing defenses, rebuilding presence on the international stage, and ensuring the nation is postured to compete. The officials announced that the President will sign a National Security Memorandum on "Improving Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure Control Systems" which will direct the Department of Homeland Security's CISA and the Department of Commerce's NIST to develop cybersecurity performance goals for critical infrastructure. They also discussed the President's Industrial Control System Cybersecurity Initiative, a voluntary effort between the government and the critical infrastructure community to deploy technology and systems that provide threat visibility. The officials emphasized that securing critical infrastructure requires a whole-of-nation effort and that the federal government cannot do it alone. They expressed the need for responsible critical infrastructure owners and operators to follow voluntary guidance and mandatory requirements to protect critical services from cyber threats. The officials also mentioned the possibility of mandating cybersecurity standards and highlighted recent Security Directives for critical pipeline owners and operators. They acknowledged the challenges in implementing cybersecurity measures, including the need for new hardware and funding, and mentioned exploring options such as grants, tax credits, and performance incentive mechanisms to accelerate adoption. The officials did not provide further details on Russian interference in the 2022 Midterm Elections.
