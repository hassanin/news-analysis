The U.S. Department of the Treasury has released a statement regarding the launch of Auto Supplier Support Programs by Chrysler LLC and General Motors Corporation. These programs are open to any receivable created with respect to goods shipped after March 19, 2009, and are available to suppliers on qualifying commercial terms. The Treasury Department is pleased that both GM and Chrysler have taken quick action to launch these programs, which will help stabilize the auto supply base and restore credit flows in a sector that employs over 500,000 American workers. The Supplier Support program aims to provide supply companies with access to liquidity and protect American jobs while ensuring GM and Chrysler have reliable access to necessary parts.
