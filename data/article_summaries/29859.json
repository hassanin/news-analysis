President Donald J. Trump has signed a new Executive Order to provide resources for veterans transitioning back to civilian life. Veterans in their first year after service are at risk for mental health issues but often do not receive sufficient care. President Trump is working with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to modernize and expand healthcare options for veterans.
