President Barack Obama has issued a Proclamation to modify and continue the national emergency declared in Proclamations 6867 and 7757 with respect to Cuba. The Proclamation acknowledges that certain descriptions of the national emergency no longer reflect the current international relations between the United States and Cuba, as diplomatic relations have been reestablished and the US is working towards a peaceful, prosperous, and democratic Cuba. The Proclamation also states that mass migration from Cuba would endanger US security and that unauthorized entry of vessels into Cuban waters is in violation of US law and against US policy. The President has directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to make appropriate rules and regulations to regulate vessel anchorage and movement.
