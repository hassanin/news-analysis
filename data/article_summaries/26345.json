He saluted the brave Vietnam veterans who fought against the spread of communism and defended the freedom of the Vietnamese people. President Trump mentioned that nearly 500,000 American troops served in South Vietnam in 1967, along with approximately 850,000 troops of allies. He emphasized the importance of helping Vietnam veterans and their families heal from the toll of war and vowed to account for the 1,253 heroes who have not yet returned to American soil. President Trump also signed into law the Vietnam War Veterans Recognition Act of 2017, designating March 29 of each year as National Vietnam War Veterans Day. He urged all Americans to thank and honor Vietnam veterans and their families privately and during public ceremonies and programs.
