President Biden has signed an Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities, which directs the implementation of U.S. commitments under the European Union-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). The EU-U.S. DPF aims to restore a legal basis for transatlantic data flows, addressing concerns raised by the Court of Justice of the European Union regarding the prior EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework. The Executive Order strengthens privacy and civil liberties safeguards for U.S. signals intelligence activities and establishes an independent mechanism for individuals to seek redress if their personal data was collected in violation of applicable U.S. law. The EU-U.S. DPF is crucial for the $7.1 trillion EU-U.S. economic relationship, as it enables cross-border data flows and supports the digital economy. These steps will provide the European Commission with a basis to adopt a new adequacy determination, ensuring accessible and affordable data transfers under EU law and offering legal certainty for companies using Standard Contractual Clauses and Binding Corporate Rules.
