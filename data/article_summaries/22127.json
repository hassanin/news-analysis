The President is pleased with the House of Representatives for reauthorizing and strengthening the Violence Against Women Act. The law has saved many lives and improved the treatment of abuse victims. The reauthorization will further reduce domestic violence, improve the treatment of rape victims, and extend protections to Native American women and the LGBT community. The bill also reauthorizes the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, providing support for both international and domestic trafficking victims. The President thanks leaders from both parties for their efforts in making this happen and looks forward to signing the bill into law.
