President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq will continue beyond May 22, 2020. The President believes that obstacles to the reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration of peace and security, and the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions in the country still pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, he has determined that it is necessary to extend the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13303.
