The annual estimate of "Mexican Poppy Cultivation and Heroin Production" conducted by the United States Government has found that poppy cultivation in Mexico decreased by 27 percent in 2019, from 41,800 hectares to 30,400 hectares. Similarly, potential pure heroin production decreased by 27 percent, from 106 metric tons to 78 metric tons. This decrease in heroin production meets a goal set by the Trump Administration's National Drug Control Strategy two years ahead of schedule. The director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), Jim Carroll, expressed encouragement regarding the progress made in reducing heroin production in Mexico. He also highlighted the potential 7 percent drop in heroin-related deaths in the United States in 2019, according to provisional overdose data. Carroll credited President Trump's actions, such as declaring the opioid crisis a Public Health Emergency and a National Emergency on the Southern Border, for saving American lives. However, the ONDCP remains concerned about reports of continued methamphetamine and fentanyl production in Mexico and emphasizes the need for collaboration between the two nations to address all illicit substances. The United States acknowledges the efforts of Mexican President Lopez Obrador to prioritize social programs that aim to provide alternative livelihoods for farmers in drug-producing areas as part of his counternarcotics strategy.
