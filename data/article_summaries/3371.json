The White House recently held a roundtable discussion on heat pump manufacturing and deployment, highlighting President Biden's commitment to investing in clean energy manufacturing jobs and reducing energy costs. The roundtable brought together government officials, heat pump manufacturers, distributors, and labor leaders to discuss how investments from President Biden's legislative initiatives will expand the American heat pump manufacturing industry and create skilled job opportunities. Heat pumps are energy-efficient systems that provide heating, cooling, and hot water while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Biden-Harris Administration is utilizing various programs and investments to promote heat pump manufacturing capacity, workforce development, and consumer adoption. This roundtable coincides with President Biden's efforts to lower energy costs and increase consumer demand for heat pumps, with more Americans purchasing heat pumps over gas furnaces in 2022. Deploying heat pumps in homes and buildings, along with energy efficiency improvements and clean energy deployment, will help address the climate crisis, enhance energy security, lower energy costs, create jobs, and improve community health.
