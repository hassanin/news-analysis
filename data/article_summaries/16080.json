President Obama has amended the disaster declaration for the Santa Clara Pueblo, authorizing an increase in federal funding for Public Assistance projects. The increase in funding is in response to severe storms and flooding that occurred in September 2013. Previously, federal funding was available at a rate of 75 percent of total eligible costs, but now it has been increased to 90 percent.
