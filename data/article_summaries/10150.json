Countering nuclear smuggling is a complex task that requires collaboration among law enforcement, intelligence, and technical government agencies. The goal is to detect and locate illicit nuclear materials, investigate and disrupt smuggling incidents, and prevent smugglers from freely moving. Regional partnerships are crucial in addressing this transnational issue and regaining control over loose nuclear and radioactive materials. The 2016 Nuclear Security Summit focused on this topic and highlighted commitments made by various countries to strengthen capabilities in countering nuclear smuggling. INTERPOL and the European Union have hosted events to build awareness and capacity among law enforcement officials from multiple countries. The United States utilizes expertise from different government departments, as well as state, local, tribal governments, and the private sector, to investigate nuclear smugglers, detect and recover nuclear materials, and arrest and prosecute criminals involved. The US Department of State works with international partners through joint action plans and workshops to enhance counter nuclear smuggling capabilities. The Department of Energy partners with nearly 50 countries to provide capacity-building in radiation detection and nuclear forensics. The Federal Bureau of Investigation offers briefings and exercises on integrating law enforcement techniques with radiation detection technology. The Department of Defense aids partners in strengthening border security and closing off smuggling routes through equipment and training. Lastly, the United States collaborates with INTERPOL and the International Atomic Energy Agency to enhance information-sharing mechanisms related to incidents involving nuclear or radioactive materials.
