Vice President Kamala Harris addressed a group of leaders and advocates for gun safety laws at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. She thanked them for their commitment to public service and their courage in speaking out for reasonable gun safety laws. Harris emphasized the importance of not being deterred in the fight for better policy and recognized the progress that has been made. She shared stories from her college tour, where she learned that many students have had to endure active shooter drills throughout their education. Harris expressed her belief that when the younger generation starts voting in larger numbers, there will be a significant change in how gun violence is addressed. She called on the leaders to strategize and share their ideas for community violence prevention, secure storage, and assault weapons bans. Harris stressed that supporting the Second Amendment does not mean opposing gun control measures such as universal background checks and red flag laws. She described assault weapons as weapons of war that have no place in society. Harris encouraged the leaders to continue their work and highlighted the importance of lifting others up as a measure of strength. She concluded by thanking them and urging them to rest before continuing the fight in the new year.
