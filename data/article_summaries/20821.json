President Obama announced an agreement with thirteen major automakers to increase fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon for cars and light-duty trucks by Model Year 2025. This agreement is seen as a significant step towards reducing the nation's dependence on foreign oil. The automakers involved in the agreement include Ford, GM, Chrysler, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar/Land Rover, Kia, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Toyota, and Volvo. The United Auto Workers (UAW) and the State of California were also involved in developing the agreement. The new standards will require performance equivalent to 54.5 mpg or 163 grams/mile of CO2 for cars and light-duty trucks by 2025. This will result in significant savings for consumers, with an average fuel savings of over $8,000 per vehicle by 2025. The programs will also save American families $1.7 trillion in fuel costs and reduce oil consumption by 2.2 million barrels a day by 2025. The new standards will also cut carbon pollution by more than 6 billion metric tons over the life of the program. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Transportation (DOT) have worked closely with auto manufacturers, the state of California, environmental groups, and other stakeholders to ensure the standards are achievable and cost-effective. The agencies plan to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by the end of September 2011, after which there will be an opportunity for public comment and hearings. The agencies are also considering incentive programs to encourage the adoption of advanced technologies, such as electric vehicles and fuel cells.
