In less than two years, President Biden's leadership has accelerated the manufacturing and deployment of clean energy technologies in the US, aligned the country with limiting global warming to 1.5 Â°C, and encouraged global action on climate change. The US aims to enhance global ambition to accelerate the growth of the clean energy economy, mitigate the worst impacts of climate change, and help lower- and middle-income countries build resilience. President Biden has pledged to increase US international climate finance to over $11 billion a year, making the US the largest contributor. These actions are crucial for strengthening global security, especially in light of the recent disruptions caused by Russia's war against Ukraine. The US will urge countries and the private sector to not only implement existing climate commitments, but also enhance them to align with the latest scientific recommendations. The US will also support vulnerable countries in implementing adaptation efforts through the President's Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE). President Biden will attend COP27 to further accelerate the growth of a clean energy economy, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and help vulnerable communities adapt to climate impacts. The US is leading both domestically and internationally in ambitious climate actions, supporting vulnerable countries, and working towards the 1.5-degree goal.
