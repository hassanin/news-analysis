Japan has announced its support for isolating Russia from the international financial system and economies. The entire G7 now backs disconnecting selected Russian banks from SWIFT, imposing restrictions on the Russian Central Bank, and sanctioning key Russian leaders, including President Putin. Prime Minister Kishida and the Japanese government have been at the forefront of condemning Putin's attack on Ukraine and will continue to work closely to impose more severe costs and make Putin's war a strategic failure.
