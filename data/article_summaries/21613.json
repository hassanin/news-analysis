The Senate has taken bipartisan action to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), and now the Vice President is urging the House to quickly pass the bill. VAWA has been successful in improving the criminal justice response to violence against women and assisting survivors for the past 17 years. It has been reauthorized twice with broad support from both parties. The Vice President emphasizes that VAWA is still as important today as it has ever been. The Senate's action shows that addressing this issue is more important than politics, and now the House needs to act so that the President can sign the legislation as soon as possible.
