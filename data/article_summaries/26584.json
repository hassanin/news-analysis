According to a survey conducted by The Harris Poll, more than 8 in 10 voters in the United States prefer an immigration system that selects individuals based on their education and skills rather than the current system that prioritizes immigrants with relatives already in the country. The survey also found that voters support President Trump's approach to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, ending chain migration, canceling the visa lottery, and securing the borders. The survey was conducted online from February 16-19, 2018, among 1,934 registered voters.
