The United States has strongly condemned North Korea's decision to launch a long-range ballistic missile over Japan. This action is seen as destabilizing and a violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions and international safety norms. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has spoken with his Japanese and South Korean counterparts to discuss joint and international responses to this threat. The United States has reaffirmed its commitment to defending Japan and South Korea, and will continue to work with allies and UN partners to limit North Korea's prohibited weapons programs.
