The article is a Presidential Memoranda regarding the construction of Border facilities, specifically an international railway bridge project at Laredo, Texas. The permit outlines the conditions and requirements for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the Border facilities. It states that the facilities must comply with all applicable laws and regulations and may be subject to inspection by federal, state, and local agencies. The President has the authority to terminate, revoke, or amend the permit at any time. The permittee is responsible for any necessary right-of-way grants or easements, permits, and authorizations. The permit also addresses issues such as liability, indemnification, and the provision of inspection facilities to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The permittee must provide written notice to the President at various stages of construction and is required to provide information upon request. The permit expires in 15 years if construction has not commenced by that date. The permit does not create any legally enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities.
