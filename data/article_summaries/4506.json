The President has taken several actions to address high gasoline prices and save Americans money at the pump. These actions include releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to balance supply and demand, as well as urging the Federal Trade Commission to investigate potential illegal conduct by oil and gas companies that may be contributing to elevated prices. While industry costs have decreased, the President expects these savings to be passed on to consumers more quickly. The average price at the pump has already decreased by nearly 10 cents per gallon since last month's peak, and wholesale gasoline prices have dropped over 30 cents per gallon. However, the President believes that prices are still too high, particularly considering the post-pandemic recovery. It's worth noting that while the national average price of gasoline is $3.32, many states have significantly lower prices, with twenty states having state-level averages below $3.15. This number has been increasing over time, indicating a downward trend in gasoline prices.
