White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre provided an update on ongoing budget negotiations and the importance of preventing a default. She stated that the President's negotiating team has had productive discussions with the Speaker's team, and negotiations are continuing. The focus of the discussions is on two different fiscal visions for the country and the economy. The President's plan aims to invest in America, grow the economy from the bottom up, and reduce the deficit by nearly $3 trillion over 10 years by asking the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share and cutting wasteful spending. On the other hand, House Republicans have proposed a plan that slashes programs relied upon by hardworking Americans while protecting tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations that would add $3.5 trillion to the debt. Jean-Pierre emphasized that preventing default is not a matter of debate; it is the responsibility of Congress. However, the budget is up for debate, and the negotiations aim to reach a bipartisan, reasonable agreement that can win support from both Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate. She also mentioned that President Biden marked the three-year anniversary of George Floyd's murder and called on Congress to pass meaningful police reform legislation, including the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Additionally, Jean-Pierre addressed questions about the debt ceiling, potential spending cuts, and the White House's commitment to ensuring clean water for all Americans.
