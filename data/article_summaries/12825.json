In this op-ed, First Lady Michelle Obama highlights the strength, courage, and patriotism of military families. She shares stories of military spouses raising children alone, military kids growing up with parents overseas, and wounded warriors who continue to serve their communities. She specifically mentions Barbara Marshall, a veteran who combats homelessness among female veterans by welcoming them into her own home. The First Lady also discusses the Extreme Makeover: Home Edition project in Fayetteville, where a busload of volunteers worked to transform Barbara's home into a dream house and resource center. She emphasizes the importance of communities coming together to support military families and announces the Joining Forces initiative, a national effort to address the needs of military families and expand opportunities for them. She encourages everyone to visit JoiningForces.gov to learn how they can contribute to supporting military families.
