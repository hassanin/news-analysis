On June 13, 2017, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to continue the national emergency declared in 2006 regarding the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus. The national emergency was initially declared due to the threat posed by these individuals to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The threat includes undermining democratic processes, human rights abuses, and public corruption. The president stated that the national emergency and the measures adopted to address it must continue beyond June 16, 2017. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
