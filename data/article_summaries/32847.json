On Child Health Day, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation emphasizing the importance of protecting and promoting the health and well-being of children in the United States. He highlighted the responsibility of society to ensure that children grow up in healthy, safe, and loving environments. The President's Fiscal Year 2018 Budget includes a $30 million increase for the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant program, which aims to improve access to critical health services for women and children. The program focuses on prenatal care, nutrition, aid for children with disabilities, mental health disorders, and the opioid epidemic. President Trump expressed his commitment to combating opioid abuse and ensuring that children do not suffer from its consequences. The first Monday in October is designated as Child Health Day by Congress, and President Trump called upon families, professionals, organizations, and governments to work together to protect the health and well-being of children.
