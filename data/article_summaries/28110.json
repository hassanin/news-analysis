On November 26, 2019, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to address the concerns of American Indian and Alaska Native communities regarding missing and murdered individuals, particularly indigenous women and girls. The order establishes the Task Force on Missing and Murdered American Indians and Alaska Natives, which will be co-chaired by the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Interior. The task force will consist of various members from federal agencies and departments, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Department of the Interior. The mission of the task force is to conduct consultations with tribal governments, develop protocols and procedures for handling missing and murdered cases, establish a multi-disciplinary team to review cold cases, and address the need for greater clarity in roles and jurisdiction. The task force is required to submit written reports on its activities and accomplishments to the President, with a final report due two years after the order's issuance. The order also includes provisions for termination of the task force and general provisions regarding implementation and legal rights.
