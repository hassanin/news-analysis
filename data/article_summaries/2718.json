1. Impose devastating cuts to public safety: The extreme MAGA Republican House Freedom Caucus aims to cut funding for public safety, which could have negative consequences for communities and their safety.

2. Increase costs for working- and middle-class families: The proposed tax cuts by the extreme MAGA Republicans would primarily benefit the wealthy and big corporations, while potentially burdening working- and middle-class families with higher costs.

3. Ship manufacturing jobs overseas and undermine American workers: The extreme MAGA Republicans' proposals could lead to the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs, which would weaken the American workforce and potentially result in job losses.

4. Weaken national security: The extreme MAGA Republican House Freedom Caucus's budget priorities may compromise national security by reducing funding for defense and potentially hindering the country's ability to address security threats effectively.

5. Hurt seniors: The extreme MAGA Republican House Freedom Caucus's proposals could have negative implications for seniors, potentially impacting programs like Social Security and Medicare that are crucial for their well-being.

Overall, the extreme MAGA Republican House Freedom Caucus's budget proposals are in contrast to President Biden's budget, which focuses on investing in America, lowering costs for families, protecting important social programs, and reducing the deficit without burdening those making less than $400,000 per year with additional taxes.
