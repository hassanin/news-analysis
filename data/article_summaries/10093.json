President Obama visited the National Robotics Engineering Center at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh to launch the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership. This initiative aims to bring together industry, universities, and the federal government to invest in emerging technologies that will create high-quality manufacturing jobs and enhance global competitiveness. The plan will invest over $500 million and leverage existing programs and proposals. The President toured exhibits showcasing cutting-edge technologies such as crowd-sourced vehicles, next-generation robots, and modeling and simulation. He then delivered remarks to manufacturing CEOs, university presidents, students, faculty, and federal agency leaders. The tour included stops at DARPA, where the President saw a next-generation combat support vehicle that was designed and built in a short timeframe through crowd-sourcing. The President also witnessed a demonstration of a pipe inspection robot by RedZone Robotics, a CMU spinoff. Lastly, the President saw a demonstration of modeling and simulation software by Procter and Gamble, which will be released at no cost to small and mid-sized manufacturers. Attendees at the event included industry leaders, university presidents, and administration officials.
