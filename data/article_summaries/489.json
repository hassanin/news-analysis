President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has issued an order to combat and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The order aims to utilize the full capacity and capability of the Federal Government to protect and support families, schools, and businesses, as well as assist State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will provide a 100 percent Federal cost share for eligible work under Public Assistance Category B, including measures described in a previous Presidential Memorandum. The order includes general provisions to ensure compliance with applicable law and availability of appropriations, and it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities. The Administrator of FEMA is directed to publish this order in the Federal Register.
