The President has signed a new law that extends the deadline for the Commission on Combating Synthetic Opioid Trafficking to continue its work. The Fentanyl Sanctions Act deadline has been extended by 120 days, allowing the Commission to report on the flow of synthetic opioids into the United States and develop strategies to combat the supply and locate the origins of these substances. Representatives Trone and Upton, as well as Senators Cotton and Markey, are recognized for their leadership in this effort.
