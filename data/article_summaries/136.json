The first bill, H.R. 5110, known as the "Protecting Hunting Heritage and Education Act," allows the use of federal funds for providing certain weapons or training in the use of weapons for educational purposes. The second bill, S. 112, improves the benefits provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs to children of veterans diagnosed with spina bifida. Lastly, S. 2795 extends certain expiring authorities that affect veterans and their beneficiaries.
