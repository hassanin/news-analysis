The White House and the Small Business Administration have announced an expansion of President Obama's SupplierPay initiative. The initiative is a partnership with the private sector to strengthen small businesses by increasing their working capital, allowing them to grow and hire more workers. The initiative requires companies to pay their small suppliers faster or provide them with a financing solution that helps them access working capital at a lower cost. This helps small businesses by reducing the time it takes for them to get paid or lowering their short-term borrowing costs. The SupplierPay initiative also benefits larger companies by reducing their working capital costs and unlocking capital for investment. 21 new companies have joined the SupplierPay initiative, bringing the total number of participants to 47. The Commerce Department has released a report that shows the potential economic benefits for larger companies participating in the initiative. The White House will also be holding a working session to discuss the actions companies are taking to implement the SupplierPay pledge and track its impact. The article provides examples of how companies like Intuit, Lockheed Martin, and Siemens have implemented the initiative and accelerated payments to their small suppliers. The article also highlights the importance of small businesses in the American economy and the challenges they face in accessing capital and getting paid on time.
