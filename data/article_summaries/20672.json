The article is a letter from former President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate, notifying them of the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Iran. The letter states that the national emergency, which was declared on March 15, 1995, will continue beyond March 15, 2017. The letter also mentions the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) reached between the P5+1 countries, the European Union, and Iran in 2015, which aimed to ensure Iran's nuclear program remains peaceful. While nuclear-related sanctions were lifted as part of the JCPOA, certain non-nuclear sanctions against Iran remain in place. The letter explains that despite Iran's compliance with its nuclear commitments, the actions and policies of the Iranian government still pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, hence the need to maintain comprehensive sanctions against Iran.
