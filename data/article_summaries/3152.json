The Biden-Harris Administration has launched the implementation of the U.S. Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability, which aims to foster peace and long-term stability through integrated diplomacy, development, and security-sector engagement. The strategy will focus on four countries (Haiti, Libya, Mozambique, and Papua New Guinea) and one sub-region (Coastal West Africa), working towards strengthening national and regional peace, resilience, and stability. The U.S. Congress has authorized up to $200 million a year for these efforts, with $125 million already appropriated for the Prevention and Stabilization Fund in Fiscal Year 2022. The administration will closely monitor progress and milestones, with the goal of advancing innovative approaches to peace and stability.
