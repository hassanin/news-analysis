According to a Gallup poll, 67% of Americans believe that now is a good time to find a quality job in the US, the highest percentage in 17 years. This optimism about the availability of good jobs has grown by 25 percentage points since Donald Trump was elected president. Prior to 2017, the percentage of Americans who believed it was a good time to find a quality job never reached 50%, but since Trump took office, it has stayed at or above 50% and has been higher than 60% in eight of the past nine months. This increased optimism is seen across all age, income, and education groups. With unemployment continuing to drop, Americans have a higher level of confidence in the job market.
