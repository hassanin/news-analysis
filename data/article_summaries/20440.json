President Obama is traveling to Michigan to sign the bipartisan farm bill. The Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack, explains that the last five years have been the best in agriculture in the history of the country, with record farm exports, investment in conservation, and expansion of domestic markets. The farm bill creates opportunities for smaller and mid-sized operators in the local and regional food systems. It also promotes the development of bio-based product manufacturing, research and innovation, and exports. The bill provides credit and crop insurance opportunities for beginning farmers, disaster assistance for livestock producers, and reforms the safety net for producers. Secretary Vilsack also addresses questions about the impact of the bill on food stamp recipients, the safety of chemicals in Subway bread, and the trade challenges with China. The President's spokesperson, Jay Carney, discusses the immigration bill, the jobs report, and the situation in Ukraine. He also mentions the President's support for the revitalization of Detroit and the possibility of extending non-confined insurance policies.
