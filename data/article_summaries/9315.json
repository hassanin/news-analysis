During a White House stakeout, Ian Sams, a spokesperson for the President, provided an update on the ongoing investigation into classified documents. Sams stated that during a planned search conducted by the Justice Department at the Rehoboth Beach house, no classified marked documents were found. He emphasized that the President has been fully cooperative with the investigation from the beginning and will continue to do so. When asked about the FBI searching the President's former private office in Washington, Sams did not disclose any information and suggested directing the question to the Justice Department. He also declined to provide details on other searches conducted by the FBI and stated that the President's personal attorneys have been in direct discussions with the Justice Department. Sams reiterated that the President believes in the independence of the Justice Department and will continue to provide access to his homes for the investigation. He also confirmed that the White House is engaging in good faith with the House Oversight Committee's records request. Sams declined to comment on the specific contents of handwritten notes that were taken by the FBI during the searches, stating that the Justice Department is conducting a thorough review and it would be more appropriate to direct such questions to them.
