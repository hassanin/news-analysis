President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring October 4-10, 2015, as Fire Prevention Week. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of taking preventive measures to stop fires before they start and honoring the sacrifices made by first responders. It encourages Americans to test their smoke alarms, develop and practice fire evacuation plans, create family emergency communication plans, and act responsibly to prevent forest fires. The proclamation also highlights the need for Congress to fix the way wildfire costs are funded in order to invest more in forest restoration and resilience. President Obama calls on Americans to participate in observances and renew their efforts to prevent fires and their tragic consequences.
