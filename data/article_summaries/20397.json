NEC Director Lawrence Summers delivered remarks at Georgetown University, discussing the recovery program, fiscal stimulus, and financial stress tests that have helped stabilize the economy. He emphasized the importance of addressing moral hazard and reckless risk-taking, and highlighted the need for new regulatory approaches to prevent future financial crises. Summers outlined five principles for regulatory reform, including the requirement for adequate capital, the need for resolution authority, the elimination of regulatory arbitrage, a systemic approach to regulation, and the establishment of an independent agency for consumer and investor protection. He also stressed the importance of compensation practices that align with prudent risk management. Summers concluded by stating that these changes will not happen overnight, but they are necessary to overhaul the financial regulation system and address contemporary challenges.
