The White House has launched the 2011 Citizens Medal nomination process, inviting the American public to nominate candidates for the nation's second highest civilian award. The Presidential Citizens Medal recognizes citizens who have performed exemplary deeds of service for their country or fellow citizens. The nomination process aims to recognize local heroes who have significantly impacted their communities but may not have garnered national attention. President Obama will review the nominations and select the award recipients, who will be honored in a ceremony at the White House. The deadline for nominations is May 30, 2011. The Citizens Medal is generally recognized as the second highest civilian award of the United States government and is awarded to individuals who have demonstrated a commitment to service, performed extraordinary acts, addressed persistent problems, and had a sustained impact on others' lives.
