President Obama has announced a new initiative to help more Americans afford and graduate from college. The FAFSA Completion Initiative, led by the Department of Education, aims to increase the number of students completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. The initiative includes partnerships with states to identify students who have not completed the FAFSA, as well as updated tools and resources for schools and districts to support FAFSA completion. Filing the FAFSA is necessary for students to receive federal student aid, but many eligible students do not complete the form. The President's budget also includes investments in education at all levels, from early childhood through college, to expand opportunities for all Americans. These investments include funding for programs such as Race to the Top, High School Redesign, and ConnectEDucators. Additionally, the budget includes a College Opportunity and Graduation Bonus program and a State Higher Education Performance Fund to incentivize colleges and states to improve college access and success for low-income students. The budget also proposes a First in the World fund to support innovative strategies for college affordability.
