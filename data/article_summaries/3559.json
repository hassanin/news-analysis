The United Nations Security Council has convened an Emergency Special Session of the General Assembly in response to Russia's war on Ukraine. This move demonstrates global outrage and unity against Russia's actions. The majority of nations condemn Putin's war and recognize that it threatens global peace and security. Russia stands isolated, with only four authoritarian states supporting them. The vote holds Belarus accountable for its involvement in the war. The world is rejecting Russia's lies and acknowledging their responsibility for human rights abuses and the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. The United Nations was created to prevent war, and it is now time to hold Russia accountable for its actions.
