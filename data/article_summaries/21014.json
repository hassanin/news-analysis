This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating that the national emergency declared with respect to the former Liberian regime of Charles Taylor will be continued. The emergency was declared in 2004 due to the actions and policies of Charles Taylor and others, which undermined Liberia's transition to democracy and depleted its resources. Despite progress made by Liberia, the legacy of destruction left by Taylor could still pose a challenge to the country's transformation and recovery. Therefore, the national emergency must continue beyond July 22, 2013, in order to address this ongoing threat. The notice is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
