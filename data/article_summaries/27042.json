The Council of Economic Advisers has reported that the US economy is experiencing healthy growth, with a 2.8% average annual growth rate over the past year. Real GDP is on track to grow by 3.1% in 2018, the highest since 2005. The report attributes this growth to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, deregulation, and other business-friendly policies implemented by the Trump Administration. Private business investment has increased, leading to higher after-tax rates of return. Americans also have more disposable income, with real disposable personal income growing at a rate of 2.8% in 2017 and 3.5% in the first half of 2018. Small business optimism and consumer sentiment have reached record highs, and money is being repatriated back to the US due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Overall, the economy is strong, with job creation, low unemployment rates, and high confidence levels.
