President Trump has authorized an increase in the level of federal funding for Public Assistance projects in the Pueblo of Acoma. This additional disaster assistance is in response to severe storms and flooding that occurred from October 4-6, 2017. Previously, federal funding was available at 75% of the total eligible costs, but now it has been increased to 90%. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
