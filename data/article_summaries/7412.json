A new study from the Commonwealth Fund shows that President Biden's efforts to get Americans vaccinated saved millions of lives. The vaccination campaign prevented millions of hospitalizations, COVID-19 cases, and saved billions of dollars in healthcare costs. The Biden Administration used various strategies to make vaccinations accessible, and the American people played a crucial role in this success. However, Republicans in Congress are now delaying critical funding, which could hinder future progress and leave the nation vulnerable to surges and variants. Urgent action is needed to ensure the continued protection of the American people and the economy.
