The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has released a school resource guide to help educators educate and protect students from substance abuse. The guide aims to help teachers, administrators, and staff identify warning signs at school, teach children about the negative effects of drug use, and provide assistance to students struggling with substance abuse. ONDCP Director Jim Carroll emphasized the importance of reaching out to students about the dangers of drug use early on to make a difference in their lives and the lives of their families.
