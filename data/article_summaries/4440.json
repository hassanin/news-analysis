The Biden administration is taking action to address the chronic understaffing and poor care in nursing homes in the United States. Despite receiving nearly $100 billion in annual funding from taxpayers, many nursing homes do not have enough staff to provide adequate care, leading to neglect and endangerment of residents. The COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted these issues, with over 200,000 nursing home residents and workers dying from the virus.

To fulfill President Biden's commitment to improving long-term care, the administration is proposing federal minimum staffing requirements for nursing homes. Studies have shown that higher staffing levels are associated with better quality of care and patient outcomes. The proposed rule would set a minimum level of staffing, with an expected nurse staffing of about 3.9 hours per resident per day. Nursing homes would also need to assess their facility's needs and consult with workers to determine the appropriate staffing levels.

The administration is also increasing enforcement of existing standards to improve nursing home safety. This includes enhanced inspections, tougher penalties for non-compliance, and increased transparency in reporting.

In addition to staffing and enforcement measures, the administration is investing in expanding the nursing workforce and supporting job quality. This includes scholarships, tuition reimbursement, and career opportunities in nursing homes. The administration is also strengthening the overall health workforce through grants, loan repayment, and scholarship programs.

These efforts build on previous steps taken by the administration to support nursing home residents and workers. The administration is committed to improving the accountability and quality of care in nursing homes, but it also calls on Congress to adequately fund nursing home inspections.
