The United States and Russia have been working together to address cyber threats in the field of information and communications technology (ICT). They have established a working group to assess emerging threats and propose joint measures to address them. Both countries have also taken steps to increase transparency and prevent misunderstandings that could lead to instability or crisis in their bilateral relationship. This includes the sharing of threat indicators between their respective Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and the exchange of notifications through the Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers (NRRC). Additionally, a direct secure voice communications line has been authorized between the US Cybersecurity Coordinator and the Russian Deputy Secretary of the Security Council to manage crisis situations arising from ICT security incidents. These measures are meant to build confidence and strengthen relations between the two nations in cyberspace.
