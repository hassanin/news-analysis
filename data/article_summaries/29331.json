The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) has released a report on the economic costs of crime and the effectiveness of programs to reduce recidivism. The report highlights that crime imposes a significant burden on Americans' well-being and tax-financed resources, with re-arrest rates for released prisoners exceeding 50 percent. The report suggests implementing rigorous and evidence-based prison reforms to break the cycle of crime, reduce future crime, and lower incarceration costs by facilitating successful re-entry after prison release. The report focuses on three main categories of programs: mental health, substance abuse, and education, delivered within correctional facilities. The effectiveness of these programs varies, and reallocating budgets from poorly performing programs to well-performing ones could lower spending and improve results. Some individual programs have shown to reduce crime and lower incarceration costs, with a return of $1.47 to $5.27 per taxpayer dollar spent on prison reform. However, the evidence base for certain programs, such as education, is inconsistent, and more research is needed. The report emphasizes the importance of increased investment in evidence-based programs to guide future investments in reducing recidivism. Carefully designed national programs, along with empirical evaluations, would enhance policymakers' ability to allocate criminal justice funds effectively.
