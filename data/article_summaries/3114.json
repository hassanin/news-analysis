The Biden Administration has announced new actions to tackle methane emissions and support a clean energy economy. These actions include cleaning up orphaned wells, launching a Methane Reduction Infrastructure Initiative, minimizing pipeline methane leaks, reducing methane emissions from beef and dairy systems, and advancing greenhouse gas monitoring and measurement. The Department of the Interior has allocated $1.15 billion for states to clean up hazardous orphaned oil and gas wells, which will create jobs and spur economic revitalization. The Department of Energy is coordinating with relevant stakeholders on the implementation of the Methane Reduction Infrastructure Initiative, which aims to accelerate the detection, characterization, and mitigation of methane emissions from undocumented wells. The Department of Transportation is enforcing Section 114 of the PIPES Act to minimize methane emissions by pipeline operators, while the Department of Agriculture is developing science-based models and tools to reduce methane emissions from the U.S. dairy sector. The White House is forming a Greenhouse Gas Monitoring & Measurement Interagency Working Group to develop a comprehensive national GHG MMRV system. Lastly, the President's Interagency Work Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization will hold a workshop on reducing methane emissions from legacy fossil fuel infrastructure and supporting new emerging industries in energy communities.
