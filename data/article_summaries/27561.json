The article discusses the events leading up to the cancellation of the Philadelphia Eagles' visit to the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl victory. After initially accepting the invitation, the team notified the White House of the individuals attending, who were later cleared by the Secret Service. However, the team contacted the White House again to reschedule the event, citing the absence of many players. The President had already announced his overseas travel plans, and despite attempts to work with the Eagles, they offered to send only a small group of representatives. Consequently, the President decided to change the event to a celebration of the American flag with Eagles fans and performances by the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus.
