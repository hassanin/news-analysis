Ten years ago, the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin was attacked by a gunman, resulting in the deaths of six people and the injury of four others. Sadly, incidents of violence against places of worship have increased over the past decade, both in the United States and globally. This article highlights several recent fatal shootings that have occurred at various houses of worship across the United States.

President Biden has expressed his commitment to ensuring that Americans can practice their faith without fear. He recognizes the need to combat targeted violence and hate, and wants to create an environment where individuals feel safe attending religious services and freely expressing their faith. This aligns with the nation's dedication to religious freedom for all.

To achieve these goals, President Biden has signed and is implementing laws such as the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, and the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act. Additionally, the administration is taking executive actions to reduce gun violence, prioritize efforts to combat hate crimes (including those based on religious identity or affiliation), and develop a National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism.

The Biden-Harris Administration is also taking steps to protect places of worship and their congregants. This includes expanding funding for security measures, creating an online clearinghouse of federal resources to counter terrorism and targeted violence, enhancing coordination and resources, engaging with faith-based and community-based organizations (including historically underrepresented communities), and making grant programs more accessible and equitable. These efforts aim to safeguard all individuals, including those who gather at places of worship.
