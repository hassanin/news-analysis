Representative Sanford D. Bishop, Jr. expresses his support for the bipartisan agreement on tax relief for Americans. He believes that raising taxes during a fragile economy would hinder investment, job creation, and burden businesses and individuals financially. He highlights the benefit of a 2% reduction in taxes for every worker in Georgia's Second Congressional District, stating that it will stimulate the economy. He also mentions the extension of unemployment insurance benefits for out-of-work Georgians and the impact of the agreement on seniors with fixed incomes. While he would have preferred a full repeal of the estate tax, he acknowledges the relief and certainty it provides for farmers and small businesses. Representative Bishop looks forward to voting for the agreement and urges his colleagues to send it to the President for his signature before the year ends.
