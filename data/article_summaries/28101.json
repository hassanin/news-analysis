He highlighted the need for comprehensive and compassionate care to save lives and manage addiction as a chronic condition. Carroll also discussed the impact of the addiction crisis on healthcare systems, employers, law enforcement, and the broader community. He mentioned the high healthcare costs associated with substance use disorder and the positive impact of treatment on healthcare utilization and costs. Carroll called for accessible addiction care in various settings, including primary care and emergency departments. He emphasized the importance of care coordination and case management services for people with addiction, similar to those with other chronic conditions. Carroll applauded the U.S. Preventive Task Force's draft recommendation for screening adults for illicit drug use and stressed the need for patient education and regular screening. He acknowledged the stigma attached to addiction and emphasized the importance of understanding it as a medical condition. Carroll highlighted the efforts of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, along with federal, state, local, tribal governments, and the private sector, to combat drug use.
