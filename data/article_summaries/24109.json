President Obama has declared a state of emergency in Missouri due to severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that began on December 22, 2015. This declaration allows the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA to coordinate disaster relief efforts in order to help the local population affected by the emergency. The assistance provided will aim to save lives, protect property and public health, and mitigate the threat of a catastrophe. FEMA is authorized to identify and provide necessary equipment and resources to alleviate the impacts of the emergency, with debris removal and emergency protective measures being funded at 75 percent federal funding. Michael L. Parker has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
