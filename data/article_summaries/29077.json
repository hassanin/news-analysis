Neomi Rao, Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within the OMB, gave a press briefing on the regulatory reform efforts of the Trump administration. She highlighted the success of the administration in eliminating regulations, with 22 regulations eliminated for each new one, resulting in a savings of $8.1 billion in present-value terms. The administration also released the agenda for fiscal year 2018, which includes 448 deregulatory actions and 131 regulatory actions, projected to lead to about $10 billion in present-value cost savings. Rao emphasized the link between regulatory reform and economic growth, individual freedom, and making government more constitutional. She also highlighted the transparency of the administration's regulatory agenda and the use of cost-benefit analysis for both regulatory and deregulatory actions. During the Q&A session, Rao addressed questions about the taskforces responsible for regulatory reform, the breakdown of cost savings, the number of regulations to be undone or withdrawn, and the significance of the deregulatory efforts. She also explained the difference between regulations and deregulatory actions, and why regulatory reform matters for the American people.
