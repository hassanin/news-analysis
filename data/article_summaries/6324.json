President Joe Biden has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria will continue beyond May 11, 2023. The President cites the regime's brutality and repression of the Syrian people, as well as their support for terrorist organizations and possession of chemical weapons, as reasons for the national emergency to remain in effect. The United States also condemns the Assad regime's violence and human rights violations, calling for a ceasefire, the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and a political settlement in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2254. The President will consider future changes in Syria's policies and actions when deciding whether to continue or terminate the national emergency.
