President Biden will be hosting the Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Washington, DC on May 12 and 13 for a U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit. This summit is meant to highlight the United States' ongoing commitment to ASEAN and recognize its crucial role in addressing the region's most pressing issues. It will also commemorate 45 years of U.S.-ASEAN relations.

The summit will build upon President Biden's participation in the October 2021 U.S.-ASEAN Summit, during which he announced $102 million in new initiatives to enhance engagement with ASEAN in areas such as COVID-19 recovery, health security, climate change, economic growth, gender equality, and people-to-people connections.

The Biden-Harris Administration considers Southeast Asia a top priority and aims to be a strong and dependable partner in the region. The shared aspirations for the region will continue to support the common commitment to advance an Indo-Pacific that is free, open, secure, connected, and resilient.
