The presidential memorandum issued on October 1, 2020, addresses the determination of the United States regarding the efforts of foreign governments in combating trafficking in persons. The memorandum states that the United States will not provide nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related assistance to several governments, including Burundi, China, Cuba, DPRK, Eritrea, Iran, Nicaragua, Russia, and Syria, until they comply with the minimum standards set by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act or make significant efforts to do so. Additionally, the United States will not allow funding for educational and cultural exchange programs for officials or employees of Cuba, DPRK, and Syria until they meet the Act's minimum standards. The memorandum also instructs the United States Executive Director of each multilateral development bank to vote against providing loans or utilizing funds for the aforementioned governments until they comply with the Act's standards. However, there are partial waivers to allow assistance related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ebola virus disease, and meeting minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking in persons if it promotes the purposes of the Act or is in the national interest of the United States. The determination, along with the required certification and memorandum of justification, will be submitted to Congress and published in the Federal Register.
