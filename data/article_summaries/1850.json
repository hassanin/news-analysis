The White House held a background briefing on the student loans announcement. The Biden administration is following through on their promise to provide targeted student debt relief. The plan includes three major parts: debt cancellation, reforming the income-driven repayment system, and changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. The debt cancellation will provide $20,000 in relief to borrowers who received Pell Grants, and $10,000 to borrowers who meet income thresholds. The plan aims to help lower- and middle-income families and narrow the racial wealth gap. The income-driven repayment system will be reformed to reduce monthly payments for low- and middle-income borrowers and forgive loan balances after 10 years for certain borrowers. Changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program will make it easier for borrowers working in public service to gain credit towards loan forgiveness. The plan also includes measures to hold colleges accountable for high debt levels. The briefing addressed questions about inflation concerns, impact on future students, and the legal justification for the cancellation. The Education Department will release additional details on the implementation process in the coming days and weeks.
