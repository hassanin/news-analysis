The White House has released an alternative plan for pay increases for civilian federal employees in January 2017. The plan is being implemented under the authority of Title 5, United States Code, which allows for alternative pay plans if there is a "national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare." The plan is being put in place because the current pay increases for federal employees are lower than those in the private sector and statutory formulas for adjustments to the General Schedule. The alternative plan limits locality pay increases to a total combined cost of 1.6 percent of basic payroll, in order to maintain fiscal sustainability. The plan will become effective on the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2017. The decisions made will not significantly impact the ability to attract and retain qualified federal employees.
