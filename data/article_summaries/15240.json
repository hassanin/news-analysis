The White House Office of the Press Secretary has released a fact sheet on facilitating a smooth transition to the next administration. The Obama Administration began transition planning in early 2016, with a focus on preparing for the incoming administration, archiving records, and facilitating the off-boarding of current administration personnel. The White House Transition Coordinating Council and the Agency Transition Directors Council were established to coordinate planning across government. After the election, the President-Elect's Transition Team will begin reaching out to their designated counterparts at agencies to receive briefings on agency-specific information. The Administration is also ensuring the next President is prepared to protect national security by providing daily intelligence briefings and hosting interagency exercises on domestic incident management. The Administration has transferred electronic records to the National Archives and Records Administration and is providing outgoing appointees with information for their own transitions. The Administration has also made improvements to the transition process, including beginning formal transition planning earlier, streamlining transition materials, developing a plan for archiving digital records, and creating new on-boarding systems. Additionally, the Administration has engaged agencies not traditionally included in the formal transition planning process to ensure their readiness for the transition.
