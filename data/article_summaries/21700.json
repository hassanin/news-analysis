Sylvia Mathews Burwell has been confirmed as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The Senate took bipartisan action to confirm her. President Obama expressed his pleasure at her confirmation, stating that she shares his commitment to growing the economy, reducing deficits in a balanced way, and supporting the middle class. Burwell has a track record of fighting for working families and was part of an OMB team that achieved three consecutive budget surpluses. Her experience will be valuable as the administration works to replace indiscriminate budget cuts that are already affecting jobs and families. Burwell will be an important member of the president's economic team.
