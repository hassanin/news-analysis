The White House will honor twelve people as museum and library "Champions of Change" who have made a difference for their communities. These individuals are providing learning experiences for children and families, offering opportunities for teens to develop skills in science and technology, helping immigrants learn English and pursue citizenship, and providing services for hard-to-reach populations. The Champions of Change program was created to highlight Americans who are empowering and inspiring their communities. The event will be livestreamed on June 11th at 4:00 pm ET.
