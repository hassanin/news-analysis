Vice President Kamala Harris visited Coppin State University in Baltimore, Maryland, on the final day of the Investing in America tour. She announced a $20 billion competition to capitalize a clean energy financing network that will increase investment in projects that reduce pollution across the country. The funding is part of the Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which aims to combat the climate crisis and support underserved communities. The announcement is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to grow the economy, create jobs, and promote environmental justice. The funding will be deployed through two competitions, including the "Solar for All" competition, which aims to increase access to clean solar energy for low-income households. This announcement builds on previous clean energy initiatives by the administration, such as expanding access to capital for clean energy projects and supporting electric vehicle adoption.
