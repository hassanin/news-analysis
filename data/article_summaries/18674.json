The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attack carried out by al-Shabaab in Mogadishu, Somalia. The attack killed many innocent civilians, including students who were taking an exam to receive scholarships. The attackers have nothing to offer except violence and destruction, and they must be held accountable. The United States stands with the families and loved ones of those affected and with the Somali people, who have suffered for a long time. This attack highlights the need for the international community to support the African Union Mission in Somalia and the Transitional Federal Government. Al-Shabaab has shown a disregard for human life and dignity by carrying out attacks and denying humanitarian aid to those in need. The United States, United Nations, and international community will continue to provide relief to Somalis in need, while condemning al-Shabaab's actions. It is crucial to save lives and stand against those who deny the dignity of the Somali people.
