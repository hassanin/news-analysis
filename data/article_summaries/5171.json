The article discusses the continuation of a national emergency declaration by the President of the United States regarding the actions and policies of the Government of Belarus. The initial declaration was made in 2006 due to threats to national security and foreign policy posed by the undermining of Belarus's democratic processes, human rights abuses, and public corruption. In 2021, the scope of the national emergency was expanded to include the Belarusian regime's activities aimed at suppressing democracy and human rights, particularly related to the fraudulent 2020 presidential election. The President has determined that the actions and policies of the Belarusian government and the regime's harmful activities still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to US national security and foreign policy. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2006, and expanded in 2021, will continue beyond June 16, 2022.
