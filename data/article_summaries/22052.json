This article is an annex to Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) 41, which outlines the Federal Government's coordination architecture for significant cyber incidents. The Cyber Response Group (CRG) is responsible for coordinating the development and implementation of policies, strategies, and procedures for responding to cyber incidents. The CRG includes senior representatives from various federal departments and agencies, such as the Departments of State, Defense, Justice, Commerce, Energy, and Homeland Security. The CRG collaborates with the Counterterrorism Security Group and Domestic Resilience Group for cross-disciplinary response. The article also discusses the National Operational Coordination, which involves the establishment of a Cyber Unified Coordination Group (UCG) to coordinate the response to significant cyber incidents. Sector-specific agencies (SSAs) are members of the UCG for incidents that affect their respective sectors. The article further explains the Federal Government's response to incidents affecting federal networks, including civilian federal networks, the Department of Defense Information Network, and the Intelligence Community Networks. The implementation of this directive includes updating the CRG charter, establishing enhanced coordination procedures, incorporating the directive into training and exercises, conducting post-incident reviews, and developing a national cyber incident response plan.
