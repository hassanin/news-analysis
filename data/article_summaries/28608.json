Senator Bernie Sanders is proposing a government takeover of healthcare, which is being criticized for potentially hurting seniors, eliminating private health insurance for 180 million Americans, and causing economic problems and debt for future generations. The Trump Administration, on the other hand, aims to provide Americans with realistic solutions that offer options, control, affordability, ease, and quality in healthcare, rather than a government takeover. They plan to protect people with pre-existing conditions, lower prices for care and prescription drugs, eliminate surprise medical bills, and ensure the best quality of care for Americans.
