President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288 regarding Zimbabwe will continue beyond March 6, 2018. The change in government following Robert Mugabe's resignation has provided an opportunity for Zimbabwe to implement reforms and potentially engage with the United States. However, certain members of the Zimbabwean government and other individuals are still considered a threat to US foreign policy. As a result, President Trump has decided to maintain the sanctions and continue the national emergency.
