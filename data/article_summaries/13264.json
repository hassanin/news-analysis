This article is a notice from the White House, specifically from the Office of the Press Secretary. It announces the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq. The national emergency was initially declared on May 22, 2003, by President George W. Bush through Executive Order 13303. The purpose of this declaration was to protect the Development Fund for Iraq and certain other property in which Iraq has an interest. The emergency was declared under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

The President took this action due to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance of peace and security in the country, and the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq. Over the years, the scope of the national emergency was modified through subsequent executive orders issued by President Bush and President Obama.

The continuation of the national emergency is deemed necessary because the obstacles to the reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance of peace and security, and the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Obama, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act, is continuing the national emergency for one more year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
