President Donald J. Trump has issued a posthumous full pardon to Zay Jeffries for his conviction under the Sherman Act. Jeffries, a leading scientist, played a crucial role in the United States' war efforts during World War II, helping develop artillery shells that could penetrate German tank armor and contributing to the Manhattan Project. Although indicted in 1941, Jeffries' importance to the war effort led to a request from Secretary of War Stimson, approved by President Roosevelt, to defer any prosecution until after the war. When the Department of Justice returned to the case in 1947, they used a Supreme Court precedent that did not exist at the time of Jeffries' indictment. The judge in the case reportedly expressed remorse when issuing Jeffries' sentence, which was a $2,500 fine without jail time. In 1948, President Truman awarded Jeffries the Presidential Medal for Merit. The President's decision to pardon Jeffries is based on his contributions to securing an Allied victory in World War II and has garnered support from Senator Lindsey Graham, former Congressman Trey Gowdy, and others.
