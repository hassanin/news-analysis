The article discusses the establishment of the International Network for Nuclear Security Training and Support Centres (NSSCs) by various countries participating in the 2012 Seoul Nuclear Security Summit. The aim of the NSSCs is to develop a highly qualified and well-trained cadre of nuclear security personnel, provide technical support for the use and maintenance of nuclear security systems, and offer scientific support for detecting and responding to nuclear security events. The International Atomic Energy Agency's Office of Nuclear Security coordinates the activities of the Network and supports member states through its Nuclear Security Web Portal (NUSEC). The NSSCs contribute to enhancing national nuclear security, promoting human resource development and education, fostering a nuclear security culture, and maintaining a skilled group of technical experts.
