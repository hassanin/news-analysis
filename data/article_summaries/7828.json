President Joe Biden delivered a speech in the East Room, announcing his plan to supercharge the Cancer Moonshot as a central effort of his administration. The goal is to cut the cancer death rate in half in the next 25 years and turn more cancers into chronic diseases. Biden called for a whole-of-government effort, forming a new Cancer Cabinet and calling on Congress to fund the proposed Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H). He also urged the scientific and medical communities, private sector, and individuals to contribute to the fight against cancer. Biden emphasized the importance of cancer screenings and early detection, urging Americans to schedule screenings that were missed during the COVID-19 pandemic. He concluded by encouraging everyone to keep the faith and spread hope in the fight against cancer.
