On September 16, 2016, President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order amending the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States. The order states that Part I, Part II, and Part IV of the Manual will be amended as described in the Annex attached to the order. These amendments will take effect immediately, but it is important to note that they will not make punishable any act done or omitted prior to the effective date of the order that was not punishable when it occurred. Additionally, the amendments will not invalidate any ongoing nonjudicial punishment proceedings, restraint, investigation, referral of charges, or trial in which arraignment has already occurred. These actions may proceed as if the amendments had not been prescribed.
