The Biden Administration has made significant progress in the fight against COVID-19 by investing in vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks. However, Congress has not provided the necessary funding to continue the response to the pandemic. As cases rise globally, there is a risk of increasing cases in the US as well. Without funding, there won't be enough boosters or variant-specific vaccines for all Americans, and the supply of monoclonal antibody treatments will run out. The federal government will also be unable to sustain testing capacity. President Biden has requested $22.5 billion in emergency funding to ensure the country can continue to move forward safely. Lack of funding will have severe consequences, including leaving the US less prepared and costing more lives. Additionally, the Administration is requesting Congress to provide authority for seamless access to Medicare and insurance coverage for COVID treatments under Emergency Use Authorization.
