Last night, the U.S. military conducted a successful counterterrorism operation in northwest Syria. The mission aimed to protect the American people, allies, and enhance global safety. The operation resulted in the elimination of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, the leader of ISIS. Thankfully, all American personnel involved in the operation returned safely. The President plans to address the nation later today. Prayers for the safety of our troops were expressed.
