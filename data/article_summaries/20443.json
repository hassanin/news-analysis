In this statement, President Obama discusses his decision to sign the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, despite his disagreement with certain provisions. He explains that while he supports the majority of the act, there are sections that limit the Defense Department's ability to allocate resources effectively and may result in future unfunded liabilities. He also expresses concern about provisions that restrict the military's authority to transfer detainees and interfere with his ability to make time-sensitive determinations as Commander in Chief. The President opposes certain funding restrictions and the renewal of the bar against transferring Guantanamo detainees into the United States, as he believes that prosecuting terrorists in federal court is an effective tool in protecting the nation. He argues that these provisions may violate constitutional separation of powers principles. Additionally, he mentions provisions that could interfere with his constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations and manage and direct executive branch officials. The President concludes by stating that his administration will interpret and implement these provisions in a manner consistent with his constitutional authority.
