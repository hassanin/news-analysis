The President of the United States, Joseph R. Biden Jr., has announced the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Lebanon. This emergency was initially declared on August 1, 2007, due to the actions of certain individuals undermining Lebanon's legitimate and democratically elected government, contributing to the breakdown of the rule of law, and infringing upon Lebanese sovereignty. Ongoing activities, such as Iran's arms transfers to Hizballah, further undermine Lebanon's sovereignty and contribute to regional instability. Therefore, the national emergency will remain in effect beyond August 1, 2021, for an additional year. This announcement follows the provisions of the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
