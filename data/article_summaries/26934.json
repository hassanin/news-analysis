Vice President Mike Pence led a discussion with the chief executives of over 50 states, territories, and Washington, DC, to provide an update on the all-of-America approach to respond to, prepare for, and mitigate the effects of COVID-19. The Federal government helps scale best practices, coordinates key priorities, and provides regulatory flexibilities and key resources to supplement, but not replace private sector, local, and state resources. Participants discussed the importance of connectivity to healthcare providers and their associated supply chains, as well as the need for a clear dashboard of all key resources in each community and across each state. The Vice President and Dr. Birx urged state and local leaders to regularly highlight the "15 Days to Slow the Spread" community mitigation guidance established by the CDC. The participants also discussed various actions taken by the Federal government to support state, local, and private sector leaders, including data sharing, removing telemedicine barriers, and supporting small businesses and American workers. The Vice President applauded specific governors for implementing innovative solutions, such as scaling testing, conserving key resources, and utilizing emergency management structures for coordinated efforts. Since January 2020, the Trump Administration has held over 60 briefings with over 35,000 state, local, and tribal leaders in every state and territory in the nation.
