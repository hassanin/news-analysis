Italy and the United States have successfully removed all eligible fresh highly enriched uranium (HEU) and plutonium from Italy. This is part of a joint effort between the Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration's Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) and Italy's Societ√† Gestione Impianti Nucleari (SOGIN). This is the thirteenth shipment of material from Italy to the United States under this program. The material, which included UK and U.S.-origin material, was securely stored under International Atomic Energy safeguards before being transported. The project faced significant technical challenges, but the team was able to overcome them and complete the operation on schedule. The material will be stored in secure facilities in the United States until it is disposed of or downblended to low-enriched uranium (LEU) for civilian purposes. The United States and Italy plan to continue working together to eliminate additional stocks of special nuclear material and assist other countries in doing the same.
