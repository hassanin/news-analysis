President Joe Biden has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria will continue beyond May 11, 2022. The Syrian regime's brutality and repression of its people, along with its support for terrorist organizations and possession of chemical weapons, pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The United States condemns the violence and human rights abuses of the Assad regime and its Russian and Iranian supporters, calling for a ceasefire, delivery of humanitarian aid, and a political settlement in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2254. The United States will consider future changes in Syria's policies and actions when deciding whether to continue or terminate this national emergency.
