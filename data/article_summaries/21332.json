President Obama has announced the launch of an initiative aimed at transforming the federal government into a model employer for veterans. The initiative, called the Veterans Employment Initiative, aims to increase the employment of veterans within the federal government and help recently hired veterans adjust to civilian life. An interagency Council on Veterans Employment will be created to advise the President and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management on the initiative. The initiative also establishes Veterans Employment Program offices within federal agencies to help veterans identify employment opportunities and adjust to civilian life. The Office of Personnel Management will issue a government-wide strategic plan focused on creating leadership commitment and infrastructure to promote skills development and employment success for veterans. The Department of Homeland Security has pledged to grow its veteran workforce to over 50,000 by 2012.
