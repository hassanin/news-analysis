The Council of Economic Advisers has released a report on the economic effects of health care reform on small businesses and their employees. The report highlights that small businesses are crucial to the economy and are an important source of job growth. However, the current health care system is not working well for small businesses and their workers. Small businesses pay up to 18% more per worker than large firms for the same health insurance policy, and many small firms are unable to provide health insurance for their employees. The report suggests that health care reform, as envisioned in the current draft legislation, would reduce the burdens on small firms and their workers. It proposes the creation of an insurance exchange, allowing small businesses to choose from multiple plans that provide better coverage at lower costs. Small businesses that provide health insurance would receive a tax credit, and there would be incentives for medium- and large-sized firms to provide coverage. The reforms would also provide better and lower-cost options for workers in small businesses that do not offer health insurance. The report suggests that these reforms could spur entrepreneurial activity, increase the pool of workers willing to work for small firms, and reduce the phenomenon of "job lock." Additionally, improvements in worker productivity resulting from better health outcomes would benefit small businesses.
