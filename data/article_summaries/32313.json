Worker compensation in the US rose to its highest level since 2008 in the second quarter of 2018, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The employment cost index increased 0.6% for civilian workers, bringing the 12-month rate to 2.8%. This marks a significant increase in wage gains, which have been lacking in the economic recovery. The index had struggled to stay above 2% following the recession, but has been steadily rising in the past year and a half. Wages and salaries rose 0.5% for the quarter and 2.8% for the 12-month period. This news follows the robust GDP growth of 4.1% in the second quarter.
