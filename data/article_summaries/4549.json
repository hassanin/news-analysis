The bipartisan funding bill, which is set to be signed into law, advances several key priorities for the country. It includes provisions for cutting-edge research on cancer and other diseases through the ARPA-H initiative, funding for community policing and the highest funding level for the Violence Against Women Act in history. The bill also addresses the healthcare needs of veterans and provides additional assistance to Ukraine. It aims to support communities recovering from natural disasters and strengthen worker protections for pregnant women. Additionally, bipartisan members of Congress passed the Electoral Count Act, taking steps to protect the integrity of elections. The bill demonstrates that Republicans and Democrats can work together to deliver for the American people.
