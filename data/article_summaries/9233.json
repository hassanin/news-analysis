President Biden has issued an executive order to address gun violence in the United States. The order emphasizes the need to reduce gun violence and protect the safety of children and the nation. It highlights the progress made so far in keeping guns out of dangerous hands, holding gun traffickers and rogue dealers accountable, and investing in community violence interventions. The order also calls on Congress to take further action, such as banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, implementing background checks for all gun sales, and funding comprehensive safety plans. The order requires various government agencies to submit reports on the implementation of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and take additional actions to reduce gun violence. These actions include clarifying the definition of firearm dealers, preventing former dealers from continuing to engage in the business, publicly releasing inspection reports, and supporting the modernization of firearms laws. The order also promotes safe storage of firearms and encourages the use of extreme risk protection orders. Additionally, it calls for a proposal on how the federal government can better support the recovery and mental health needs of survivors, families, and communities affected by gun violence. The order outlines principles for firearm and public safety practices within the Department of Defense and sets requirements for law enforcement agencies to submit ballistics data. It also aims to reduce the loss or theft of firearms during shipment and calls for the Federal Trade Commission to analyze how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors and civilians. The order includes general provisions to ensure its implementation is consistent with applicable law and subject to available appropriations.
