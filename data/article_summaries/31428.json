The Trump administration is proposing a new definition for the Waters of the United States rule, which aims to give power back to the states and landowners in managing their land and water resources. The proposed definition would clarify the difference between federally protected wetlands and state protected wetlands, providing certainty to landowners on whether their projects require federal permits. The administration argues that this new definition would respect the limits of federal authority and allow Americans to develop and invest in projects that improve the environment and their lives.
