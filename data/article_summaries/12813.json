The United States and the Czech Republic have a history of cooperation in various areas, including promoting economic prosperity, regional stability, and energy security. In the energy sector, the two countries have been deepening their bilateral relationship through various initiatives. 

In 2009, President Obama traveled to Prague and outlined his nuclear agenda, which included a vision for a world free of nuclear weapons and a commitment to the safe and peaceful use of nuclear power. In 2010, the Department of Commerce led a civil nuclear trade policy mission to the Czech Republic, and a joint declaration was signed to expand cooperation in civil nuclear energy research and development (R&D) and strengthen commercial relations. 

The United States and the Czech Republic have also announced cooperative scientific and technical initiatives in the nuclear field. These initiatives include the establishment of a Civil Nuclear Cooperation Center in Prague to facilitate joint work, research collaborations between Texas A&M University and Czech universities to improve reactor core analyses and nuclear safety, and collaboration between U.S. and Czech research institutes on fluoride volatility methods for treating used nuclear fuel. 

Additionally, the two countries will be launching an exchange program for high school science teachers to encourage collaboration and interest in nuclear energy fields among students. 

Both the United States and the Czech Republic are also working together to advance nuclear safety and security. This includes cooperation between national regulators, personnel exchanges, and joint efforts to review digital instrumental and control activities at nuclear plants. A regional Nuclear Safety Workshop was also conducted to share best practices and lessons learned from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident. 

Furthermore, the United States and the Czech Republic are collaborating to address the threats of nuclear terrorism globally. The Czech Republic is a key partner in the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism and has contributed funding to support the U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration's work in Georgia. 

Overall, the United States and the Czech Republic have been actively working together to promote the safe and secure use of nuclear energy, enhance nuclear safety, and combat nuclear terrorism.
