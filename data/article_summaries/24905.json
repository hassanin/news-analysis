Gina McCarthy has been confirmed by the Senate as the next Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The President is pleased with this bipartisan action and believes that McCarthy, with her experience at the state and local level, is a proven leader who can build support for environmental solutions that protect the health and safety of children while promoting economic growth. The President has valued McCarthy's counsel over the past four years and looks forward to having her in his Cabinet as they work on addressing climate change and creating a cleaner environment for future generations.
