On June 15, 2018, the President signed two laws related to veterans. The first law designates the medical center of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Huntington, West Virginia, as the Hershel "Woody" Williams VA Medical Center. The second law, known as the "Veterans Cemetery Benefit Correction Act," requires the National Park Service to provide outer burial receptacles for veterans and service members buried in national cemeteries it manages.
