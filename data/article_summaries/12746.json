President Obama has declared a major disaster in Kansas due to severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred between July 22 and August 16, 2013. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has appointed Christian Van Alstyne as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
