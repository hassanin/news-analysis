President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring February 2015 as National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month. The proclamation emphasizes the urgent need to end dating violence, as an estimated 1 in 10 American teenagers are physically hurt by a boyfriend or girlfriend each year. The proclamation highlights the negative consequences of dating violence, such as substance abuse, depression, poor academic performance, and future victimization. It also emphasizes the importance of recognizing the warning signs of an unhealthy relationship and speaking up about dating violence. The proclamation encourages individuals who are in abusive relationships to seek immediate and confidential support from the National Dating Abuse Helpline. The federal government is committed to addressing sexual assault and supporting teenagers and their communities through prevention efforts and improved response. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to support efforts in their communities and schools, as well as in their own families, to empower young people to develop healthy relationships and prevent and respond to teen dating violence.
