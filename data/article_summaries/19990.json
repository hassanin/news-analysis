This memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama in January 2016, promotes the development and use of smart gun technology to prevent firearm accidents and unauthorized use. The memorandum directs the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Homeland Security to conduct or sponsor research into gun safety technology that can reduce accidental discharges and improve the tracing of lost or stolen guns. The departments are also instructed to regularly review the availability of this technology and explore ways to further its use and development. The memorandum emphasizes that this research and development should be consistent with the Second Amendment and aims to expedite the practical deployment of smart gun technology. The memorandum also states that it does not impair the authority of any department or agency, or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It is intended to be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
