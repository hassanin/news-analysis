The United States expresses grave concern over reports of strikes hitting a UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) facility in southern Gaza, where thousands of displaced Palestinians were taking shelter. While details are still unknown, every innocent life lost in this conflict is seen as a tragedy. The United States supports Israel's right to defend itself against Hamas terrorists, but also emphasizes Israel's responsibility to protect civilians and humanitarian sites. The US will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to Gaza and work towards the release of hostages.
