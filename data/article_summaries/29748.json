President Donald J. Trump is urging all civilized nations to help end the violence in Syria by calling on Syria and its allies to declare and dismantle its chemical weapons arsenal. The recent use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime on April 7, 2018 is just one example of Assad's ongoing aggression against his own people. Russia and Iran have played a role in enabling Assad's actions by contributing to the chaos in Syria.
