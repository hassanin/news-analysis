The Obama Administration is taking steps to increase the nation's resilience to earthquakes. A scientific assessment shows that over 143 million Americans could experience potentially damaging earthquakes. The White House is hosting an Earthquake Resilience Summit to highlight the importance of a whole-community approach in improving resilience to earthquakes. The Administration and stakeholders will announce new commitments to earthquake safety, including an Executive Order for enhanced seismic safety and federal actions to advance earthquake early warning. States and local communities are also making commitments to advance earthquake early warning. The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation is providing grants to advance the ShakeAlert system, and companies such as Puget Sound Energy, Pacific Gas & Electric, Intel Corporation, and Amazon Catalyst are also contributing to earthquake resilience efforts.
