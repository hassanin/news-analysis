On April 6, 2020, President Donald Trump issued an executive order regarding the recovery and use of space resources. The order states that successful long-term exploration and scientific discovery of the Moon, Mars, and other celestial bodies will require partnership with commercial entities to recover and use resources such as water and minerals. However, uncertainty regarding the legal framework for the recovery and use of space resources has discouraged some commercial entities from participating. The order emphasizes that Americans should have the right to engage in commercial exploration and use of resources in outer space, and it encourages international support for such activities. The United States does not consider the Moon Agreement, which establishes guidelines for the recovery and use of space resources, to be an effective or necessary instrument. The Secretary of State is tasked with taking appropriate actions to encourage international support for the recovery and use of space resources, including negotiating joint statements and bilateral and multilateral arrangements with foreign states. A report on these efforts is required to be submitted within 180 days. The order does not affect existing authorities or functions of executive departments or agencies, and it is subject to applicable law and the availability of appropriations.
