President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation declaring May 3-9, 2020 as National Hurricane Preparedness Week in the United States. In the proclamation, he urges Americans in hurricane-prone regions to take appropriate measures to mitigate the devastation caused by these storms. The administration is dedicated to enhancing hurricane tracking and prediction capabilities, using advanced computing and weather forecasting models. The National Weather Service's Weather-Ready Nation initiative and the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Ready Campaign are highlighted as resources for individuals and communities to prepare for hurricanes and severe storms. The proclamation also acknowledges the strain on medical professionals, first responders, and critical infrastructure workers during hurricane season, especially amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Trump calls upon all Americans to take action and utilize online resources provided by government agencies to safeguard their families, homes, and businesses from the dangers of hurricanes. Additionally, he calls upon emergency management officials at all levels to educate communities about hurricane preparedness and response to prevent storm damage and save lives.
