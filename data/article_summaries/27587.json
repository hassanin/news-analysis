President Donald Trump has proclaimed June 2019 as National Homeownership Month in the United States. In his proclamation, he acknowledges the benefits of sustainable homeownership, stating that it is an important option for many Americans to invest in their communities, build wealth, and achieve the American Dream. Trump highlights the success of his administration's economic policies, which have led to a booming economy, the creation of nearly 6 million new jobs, and rising wages. He also mentions the reduction of job-killing regulations and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which have put more money into the pockets of American workers. Trump emphasizes the need to reform the nation's housing finance system to promote competition, maintain the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, and improve access to sustainable mortgages. He concludes by reaffirming the commitment to empower more Americans with the opportunity to become homeowners through low taxes, regulatory reform, and housing finance system reforms.
