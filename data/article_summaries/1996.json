President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Lebanon, which was declared in Executive Order 13441 on August 1, 2007, is to continue beyond August 1, 2022. The ongoing activities, such as Iran's arms transfers to Hizballah, including increasingly sophisticated weapons systems, undermine Lebanese sovereignty, contribute to instability in the region, and pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Biden has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency. The notice has been sent to the Federal Register for publication.
