On May 12, 2014, President Biden declared a national emergency in response to the situation in and in relation to the Central African Republic. This emergency was declared due to the breakdown of law and order, sectarian tension, the use of child soldiers, and widespread violence and atrocities, including those committed by entities linked to the Kremlin and Yevgeniy Prigozhin. The national emergency, initially declared in 2014, is set to continue beyond May 12, 2023, as the situation in the Central African Republic still poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. This decision to extend the national emergency for another year is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. The announcement will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
