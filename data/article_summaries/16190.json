The White House has released its fiscal year 2017 budget. The budget includes proposals for cybersecurity, cancer research, opioid addiction treatment, and early childhood education, among other things. The White House is hopeful that there can be bipartisan agreement on these issues, but acknowledges that there are some priorities that Republicans do not share. The budget also includes proposals for tax cuts for middle-class families and deficit reduction measures. The President is committed to using his last year in office to make progress on these priorities and deliver for the American people. The budget does not include a plan to close the Guantanamo Bay prison, but the White House says that a separate plan will be put forward at a later date. The budget also proposes a 1.6 percent increase in pay for federal employees. The White House is open to working with Republicans on these issues, but acknowledges that there are significant differences between the parties.
