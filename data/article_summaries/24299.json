This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria. The national emergency was initially declared in 2004 and has been modified and extended several times since then. The President took these actions due to the threat posed by the Syrian government's support for terrorism, occupation of Lebanon, pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, and undermining of stabilization efforts in Iraq. The article also highlights the Syrian regime's brutal war on its own people and its use of chemical weapons. The United States condemns these actions and calls for a political transition in Syria. The notice states that the national emergency will continue for another year, and changes in the Syrian government's composition, policies, and actions will be considered in the future.
