Senator Sinema has played a crucial role in supporting President Biden's significant legislative initiatives over the past 20 months. Some of these include the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, CHIPS and Science Act, PACT Act, Gun Safety Act, and the Respect for Marriage Act. Despite her decision to register as an independent in Arizona, it will not affect the Democratic majority control of the Senate. The expectation is that they will continue to work effectively with her.
