President Biden believes in building the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, rather than the top down. He believes that when the middle class does well, the poor have opportunities and the wealthy still thrive. His economic strategy focuses on promoting workers, investing in America and its people, making the economy more competitive, and reforming the tax code to reward work. The progress made in the last two years shows that this strategy is working.

The state of the economy is strong, with President Biden overseeing a historic recovery from the pandemic. In a two-year period, his administration has created more jobs than any other president on record and lowered costs for families. This includes cutting prescription drug costs, health insurance premiums, and energy bills, as well as driving the uninsured rate to historic lows. The manufacturing sector has also experienced a boom, particularly in infrastructure, semi-conductors, and clean energy, creating good jobs for workers without college degrees.

President Biden's economic strategy has been fiscally responsible. Unlike his predecessor, who passed a nearly $2 trillion unpaid tax cut favoring the wealthy and large corporations, President Biden has reduced the deficit by $1.7 trillion. His reforms to take on Big Pharma, lower prescription drug costs, and ensure the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share will further reduce the deficit by hundreds of billions.

However, President Biden acknowledges that there is still work to be done to build an economy that benefits everyone. He will discuss the implementation of his historic investment agenda, which aims to continue growing the economy and lowering costs. He will also preview the budget he will send to Congress, which will focus on investing in America and its people, lowering costs for families, protecting and strengthening Social Security and Medicare, and reducing the deficit.

The article highlights the historic progress made in creating jobs, promoting workers, and transitioning to steady and stable growth. It also emphasizes the manufacturing boom across the country and the historic investments in infrastructure. The administration is working to ensure that these investments use materials made in America, supporting American jobs.

President Biden has also focused on lowering healthcare costs for families. The article mentions the reduction in health insurance premiums and the protection of Medicare beneficiaries from skyrocketing drug costs. The administration has also taken steps to prevent surprise medical bills and make hearing aids more affordable.

Promoting competition is another key aspect of President Biden's economic strategy. The article mentions efforts to crack down on junk fees in the banking and credit card industries and increase transparency in airline fees. The administration has also addressed non-compete agreements, lowered ocean shipping costs, and increased competition in the meat and poultry markets. The President has supported the right to repair and taken steps to improve safety and accountability in nursing homes.

Lastly, President Biden aims to reduce the deficit by ensuring that the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share. He has implemented a billionaire minimum tax, a surcharge on corporate stock buybacks, and a corporate minimum tax. The administration has also cracked down on tax cheats and created a fairer tax system.

Overall, President Biden's economic strategy has led to a strong economy, created jobs, lowered costs for families, and reduced the deficit. However, there is still work to be done to continue growing the economy, promoting competition, and ensuring economic security for all Americans.
