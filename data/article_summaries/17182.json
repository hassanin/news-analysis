This article is a letter from former President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate. The letter discusses the continuation of a national emergency with respect to Zimbabwe. The national emergency was declared in 2003 and is related to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other individuals who undermine Zimbabwe's democratic processes or institutions. The letter states that the crisis caused by these actions and policies has not been resolved and continues to pose a threat to the foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, Obama determines that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and maintain sanctions to address this threat.
