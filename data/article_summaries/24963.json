This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by Barack Obama on December 16, 2014. The memorandum discusses the withdrawal of certain areas of the United States Outer Continental Shelf from leasing disposition. Specifically, the memorandum revokes a previous memorandum from March 31, 2010, and directs the Secretary of the Interior to withdraw the North Aleutian Basin Planning Area, including Bristol Bay, offshore Alaska, from leasing for an indefinite period of time. The purpose of this withdrawal is to protect the importance of Bristol Bay and the North Aleutian Basin Planning Area to Alaska Natives, wildlife, wildlife habitat, and sustainable commercial and recreational fisheries. The withdrawal ensures that the unique resources of Bristol Bay will be preserved for future generations. It is important to note that this withdrawal does not affect existing leases in the area.
