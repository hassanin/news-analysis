The article discusses the unexpected hiring boom in the retail and manufacturing sectors in the United States. Despite expectations of hiring slowing down in 2018 due to a tight labor market, employers have been adding an average of 215,000 jobs a month to payrolls, compared to 184,000 jobs during the same period last year. Retailers have been adding jobs after shedding them in 2017, thanks to an increase in consumer spending. Similarly, the manufacturing sector, which has been shedding jobs since the late 1970s, has seen an increase in employment since 2009, with growth accelerating in the past year. Factors contributing to this growth include a growing global economy that demands American-made goods, increased domestic oil production, and the tax law enacted last year that incentivizes businesses to invest in capital equipment.
