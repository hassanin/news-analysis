On National Manufacturing Day, President Joe Biden celebrates American workers and pledges to invest in them to ensure a future where products are "Made in America." He acknowledges that manufacturing is the backbone of the economy but has not always been treated as such in recent decades. Previous approaches, such as trickle-down economics, led to economic inequality and the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs. President Biden ran on a platform of changing this by growing the economy from the middle class and bottom up. He highlights the success of his plan, with over 13 million new jobs created, including 800,000 in manufacturing, and low unemployment rates. Companies are reinvesting in America, with over $500 billion in private investment attracted to manufacturing and future industries. The Biden administration's focus on investing in America and American workers has led to the creation of more American jobs and the export of American products. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act are examples of initiatives aimed at strengthening American manufacturing and innovation. The government is also prioritizing buying American-made products by updating the Buy American Act and implementing new standards for federal infrastructure projects. President Biden emphasizes the importance of not giving up on American manufacturing and highlights the industrial revival happening in the country. He encourages Americans to participate in National Manufacturing Day and support American-made products.
