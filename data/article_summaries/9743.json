This article is about an executive order issued by President Barack Obama in 2012. The order establishes principles of excellence for educational institutions that serve service members, veterans, spouses, and other family members. The order is aimed at ensuring that federal military and veterans educational benefits programs provide these individuals with the necessary information, support, and protections. It addresses issues such as aggressive and deceptive targeting of veterans by some institutions, encouraging the use of costly institutional loans instead of federal student loans, misleading recruiting practices, and failure to disclose important information about graduation rates and success in the workforce. The order directs the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Education to establish principles for educational institutions receiving funding from federal military and veterans educational benefits programs. These principles should ensure that institutions provide meaningful information about the cost and quality of education, prevent abusive and deceptive recruiting practices, and provide high-quality academic and student support services. The order also includes provisions for implementing the principles, developing service member and veteran student outcome measures, and strengthening enforcement and compliance mechanisms.
