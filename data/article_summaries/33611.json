According to a statement released by the White House, over one million Americans have already received a "Trump Bonus" or "Trump Pay Raise" as a result of the tax reform package signed into law by President Donald J. Trump. The President had previously stated that lowering tax rates and simplifying the tax code would boost the economy, and the initial results seem to support this claim. The statement also mentions that this is just the beginning, as the President is committed to helping Americans achieve more prosperous lives and brighter futures for their children.
