The House Committee on Veterans Affairs is set to consider the VA MISSION Act of 2018, a legislation that aims to transform the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) into a modern and integrated healthcare system. The Administration strongly supports this legislation, which consolidates and strengthens the VA's community care programs, funds the existing Veterans Choice program until the new Veterans Community Care Program takes effect, creates flexibilities for managing the VA's infrastructure, expands the Caregivers program, and strengthens the VA's workforce. The Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs has informed Congress that funding for the current Choice program is expected to run out by May 31, 2018, so the Administration urges Congress to pass this bill by Memorial Day to prevent disruptions to veterans receiving care. The President is committed to improving the VA healthcare system and providing veterans with the best care possible. The Administration is looking forward to working with Congress to enact these reforms.
