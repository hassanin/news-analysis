This article is a notice from the White House regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Lebanon. The national emergency was declared on August 1, 2007, due to the actions of certain individuals undermining Lebanon's government and democratic institutions. These actions include politically motivated violence, intimidation, and Syrian interference in Lebanon. Ongoing activities, such as arms transfers to Hizballah, are seen as a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2007 must continue for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
