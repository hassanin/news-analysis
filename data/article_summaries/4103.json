President Biden has invited 40 world leaders to the Leaders Summit on Climate, which will be held virtually on April 22 and 23. The summit aims to galvanize efforts by major economies to tackle the climate crisis and underscore the urgency and economic benefits of stronger climate action. It will also serve as a milestone on the road to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in November. The United States will announce an ambitious 2030 emissions target as its new Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement. The summit will bring together countries responsible for 80% of global emissions and GDP, as well as leaders demonstrating strong climate leadership, vulnerability to climate impacts, or innovative pathways to a net-zero economy. Key themes of the summit will include accelerating climate ambition, job creation, and technology advancement. Further details on the agenda, participants, and public viewing will be provided in the coming weeks.
