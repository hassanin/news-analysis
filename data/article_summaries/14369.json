In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims March 31, 2010, as Cesar Chavez Day in honor of the civil rights activist's 83rd birthday. The article highlights Chavez's upbringing as a migrant farm worker and his experience with the hardships faced by farm workers, such as hazardous working conditions and lack of basic necessities. Chavez later founded the United Farm Workers of America (UFW) with Dolores Huerta to address these issues. Using nonviolence principles, Chavez led marches, strikes, and boycotts to draw attention to the plight of workers and win union contracts. The article emphasizes Chavez's dedication to justice and equal opportunities, as well as his lasting impact on inspiring others through his rallying cry of "SÃ­, se puede" or "Yes, we can." President Obama calls upon all Americans to observe Cesar Chavez Day with service, community, and education programs to honor his enduring legacy.
