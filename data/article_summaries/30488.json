On December 7, 1941, the United States experienced a surprise attack at Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan, resulting in the deaths of 2,335 American service members and 68 civilians. Despite the shock, American service members at Pearl Harbor fought back with courage and resilience. Many were recognized for their heroism, including Doris "Dorie" Miller, the first African-American to be awarded the Navy Cross. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt addressed the nation and assured them of victory. In the years that followed, millions of American servicemen and women fought in World War II, with over 400,000 never returning home. National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day is observed on December 7 each year to honor those who sacrificed their lives. President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed December 7, 2019, as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day and encourages Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
