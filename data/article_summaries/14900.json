President Obama has announced a series of Regional White House Forums on Health Reform to be held across the country. These forums aim to bring the conversation about health care reform directly to communities and allow Americans to voice their concerns and ideas. The forums will be hosted by the states' Governors and will include participants such as doctors, patients, providers, and policy experts. The events will be open conversations with everyday Americans, elected officials from both parties, and senior Obama administration officials. The forums will focus on bringing down health care costs and expanding coverage for all Americans. The meetings will begin with a video recorded by the President, a summary of the findings from previous Health Care Community Discussions, and an overview of the discussion that took place at the White House Forum on Health Reform. The forums will take place in California, Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, and Vermont in March and early April. Further details about the logistics of the forums will be provided later.
