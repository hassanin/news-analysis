The article provides a readout of a teleconference call between senior officials from the United States and Russia. The call was requested by the Russian government and was aimed at setting the tone for upcoming diplomatic engagements between the two countries. The conversation focused on two paths: one of diplomacy leading to de-escalation and another focused on deterrence with serious consequences if Russia proceeds with further invasion of Ukraine. The leaders agreed on a sequence of diplomatic meetings, including the Strategic Stability Dialogue, NATO-Russia Council conversation, and an OSCE meeting. The call emphasized the importance of pragmatic, results-oriented diplomacy and the need for consultation and participation of allies and partners. The US will continue consultations with allies and partners in the coming week before the diplomatic meetings begin. The article concludes with a Q&A session, where questions were asked about the purpose of the call, the division of issues among different formats, and the preparations made by President Biden.
