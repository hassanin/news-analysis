Vice President Joe Biden chaired a meeting at Syracuse University in New York to discuss ways to help families save and pay for college. The meeting, titled "Making College More Accessible and Affordable for Middle Class Families," focused on improvements the Administration is making to the overall process of paying for college. The Vice President was joined by Secretary of Treasury Timothy Geithner, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, and other higher education experts. The meeting highlighted the need to make college savings plans more effective and reliable for middle class families. The Treasury Department provided recommendations, such as offering low-fee, age-based index funds and encouraging greater competition among state plans. The meeting also discussed the need to simplify the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and make it less intrusive. The Administration is seeking legislation to remove 29 of the most difficult questions from the form and streamline it by tailoring it to individual students. The meeting released a staff report that examined the barriers to higher education, including income inequality, mobility, cost of college, and debt load. The report emphasized the Administration's belief that a student's merit should be the determining factor in getting into and graduating from a good school. The goal is to ensure that every student has the opportunity to earn a postsecondary credential or degree.
