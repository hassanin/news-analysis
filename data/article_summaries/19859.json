On April 4, 2012, the President signed into law S. 2038, also known as the "Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012" or the "Stock Act." This law prohibits members of Congress, Executive Branch employees, Federal judges, and judicial employees from using nonpublic information derived from their official positions for personal profit. It also requires certain Federal Government employees to make their financial forms available to the public electronically.
