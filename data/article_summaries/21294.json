Senator John Kerry has expressed his support for President Obama's American Jobs Act, specifically highlighting the inclusion of the Kerry-Hutchison infrastructure bank proposal. Kerry believes that an infrastructure bank would create jobs, help businesses, and make the country more competitive. He emphasizes that this idea should be considered on its own merits, rather than as a partisan proposal. Kerry argues that there is significant private capital available for investment in infrastructure, and an infrastructure bank would unlock this capital for projects like bridges, roads, and rail. He also states that the infrastructure bank is the cheapest part of the President's jobs proposal and would create millions of jobs in the next decade. Kerry urges for bipartisan consensus to pass the infrastructure bank into law and emphasizes the need to focus on finding practical solutions for job creation and economic growth.
