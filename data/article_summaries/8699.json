President Biden announced at the Global Fund Seventh Replenishment Conference that a record-breaking $14.25 billion has been raised so far, making it the largest amount ever raised for the Global Fund and one of the biggest fundraising efforts for global health. The Global Fund, which has invested over $53 billion in the past 20 years, has saved 44 million lives and reduced the death rate from HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria by more than half in low- and middle-income countries. The funding raised will be used in the 2023-2025 grant cycle to reach over 120 countries and strengthen health systems to combat existing and future health threats. President Biden's FY 2023 budget includes a request for $2 billion for the Global Fund, with a total three-year pledge of $6 billion. The United States is the largest donor for global health and remains committed to ending the epidemics of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, as well as advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights. Various government donors, private sector partners, and implementing partner countries have also made significant pledges to support the Global Fund's work. The full list of pledges can be found on the Global Fund website.
