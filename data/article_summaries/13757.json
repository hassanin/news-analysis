President Obama has declared a major disaster in Rhode Island and ordered Federal aid to help with recovery efforts from severe storms and flooding that occurred in March 2010. The declaration makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in four counties. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for hazard mitigation measures statewide. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has named a Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations and additional designations may be made in the future. Residents and business owners can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free numbers will operate from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week.
