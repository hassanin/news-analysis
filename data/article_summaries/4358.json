The United States is already leading the clean energy economy, with sectors like wind generation, battery storage, and electric vehicles experiencing growth even during the pandemic.

President Biden is taking steps to reduce methane emissions, support sustainable agriculture, and spur innovation in the clean energy sector. The U.S. is also partnering with other countries to drive innovation and decarbonization efforts. The President aims to mobilize public and private finance for climate-smart economic growth and development, including through infrastructure projects and clean industries. Additionally, the President recognizes the importance of natural ecosystems in addressing the climate crisis and is launching initiatives to spur agricultural innovation and conserve global forests. The U.S. is also committed to reducing methane emissions across the economy and has joined a global pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. The U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan uses regulations, financial incentives, and partnerships to achieve this goal. President Biden also acknowledges the importance of clean energy adoption in reducing global emissions and is committed to partnering with governments and business leaders to drive the clean energy transition. The U.S. is launching initiatives to develop and deploy new clean energy technologies and is partnering with emerging economies to develop deep decarbonization strategies.
