President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed June 2021 as Black Music Appreciation Month in the United States. The proclamation acknowledges the significant influence of Black music and culture on the American songbook throughout history. Black music, including spirituals, folk, gospel, rhythm and blues, jazz, rock and roll, rap, and hip-hop, has shaped society, entertained and inspired people, and contributed to the nation's story. The proclamation honors innovative Black artists whose music moves and brightens lives, and recognizes their role in pioneering new ways of listening to music while preserving cultural traditions and sharing the unique experiences of the Black community. Black music has not only stood on its own as a symbol of resilience and resistance but has also influenced various other musical and cultural traditions. The proclamation emphasizes the broad spectrum of genres and styles within Black music and highlights the impact of Black artists in energizing audiences and inspiring millions around the world. It also pays tribute to past contributors to the nation's musical heritage and calls for the recognition of the crisis of racial inequity that Black Americans have faced, which is often reflected and challenged in Black music. The proclamation underscores the importance of addressing systemic racism in the music industry and working towards racial justice and equity. It encourages public officials, educators, and all people in the United States to observe Black Music Appreciation Month with activities and programs that raise awareness and appreciation for Black music.
