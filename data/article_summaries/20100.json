The op-ed, written by Gene B. Sperling, the National Economic Council Director, argues for the importance of passing the President's Jobs Act. Sperling emphasizes that failing to act on measures to stimulate job creation and economic growth would have serious consequences for the economy, small businesses, and working families. He highlights that current economic projections suggest low growth rates and high unemployment, which would be unacceptable given the long-term unemployment crisis resulting from the recession. Sperling also points out that long-term unemployment can have lasting negative effects on the economy, including declines in mental health and well-being. He criticizes Republicans for blocking the passage of the American Jobs Act and not presenting a viable alternative strategy for job creation. Sperling concludes by stating that the economy cannot afford for Republicans to reject the Jobs Act without providing a meaningful alternative.
