President Obama has described a new Small Business Lending Fund that will transfer $30 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to support loans to small businesses. The fund will be targeted at community and small banks that provide the most loans to small businesses and will offer incentives for banks to increase lending to small businesses. This initiative is part of the President's efforts to generate employment and promote the growth of small businesses. The fund aims to address the challenge faced by small businesses in accessing capital during the recession. Key aspects of the fund include limiting it to community and small banks that allocate a higher portion of their loans to small businesses and separating it from TARP to encourage participation. The fund will offer capital with incentives for banks to increase lending to small businesses. The Obama Administration will present additional ideas to Congress to increase credit to small businesses through the fund.
