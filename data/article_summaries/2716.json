The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed a rule to remove lead pipes across the United States as part of the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to protecting children and families from lead poisoning. The rule would require water systems to replace lead service lines within 10 years, aiming to secure safe drinking water for communities nationwide. Currently, over 9.2 million American households have lead pipes and service lines, disproportionately affecting low-income communities and communities of color. The proposal also includes increased tap water sampling requirements, comprehensive lead service line inventories, and strengthened requirements for reducing lead health risks. This action aligns with the Administration's Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan, which aims to reduce all sources of lead exposure. The Administration has also taken steps to reduce lead exposure from water, paint and dust in homes, air pollution, soil contamination, food, and workplace exposure. Additionally, domestic and international partnerships are being established to address lead exposure, and efforts to improve blood lead testing are being accelerated.
