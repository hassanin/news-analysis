In this article, President Barack Obama issues a memorandum regarding the purchase of oil and petroleum products from Iran. After considering various factors such as global economic conditions and oil production by other countries, President Obama determines that there is enough supply from countries other than Iran to significantly reduce the volume of oil purchased from Iran. However, due to the commitments made in the Joint Plan of Action, which addresses concerns about Iran's nuclear program, the United States will continue to allow oil purchases from Iran at the levels that were agreed upon in 2013. President Obama states that he will closely monitor the situation, and the Secretary of State is instructed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
