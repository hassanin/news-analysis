President Biden believes that resilient community and regional banks are essential for providing vital services to small businesses, workers, and families across the country. The Biden-Harris Administration has taken decisive action to ensure the stability of the banking system without risking taxpayer dollars. They have demonstrated the ability to act quickly to prevent contagion and are committed to taking strong action if necessary. The administration aims to strengthen oversight and regulation of larger banks to avoid similar situations in the future.

During the Obama-Biden Administration, strong requirements were put in place, such as the Dodd-Frank Act and subsequent regulations, to reduce the risk of future banking crises. However, the Trump Administration weakened many important safeguards and supervision for large regional banks, which led to contagion when banks like Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failed.

President Biden believes that reversing the weakening of bank safeguards and supervision for large regional banks is crucial for strengthening the banking system and protecting American jobs and small businesses. The President urges federal banking agencies, in consultation with the Treasury Department, to consider a set of reforms that will reduce the risk of future banking crises. These reforms can be accomplished under existing law and complement existing regulatory reforms.

It is important to implement common-sense safeguards to counter the harmful weakening of bank safeguards and supervision during the Trump Administration. This will help ensure that community and regional banks remain resilient and continue to support small businesses and jobs.
