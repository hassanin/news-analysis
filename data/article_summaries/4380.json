He ordered the balloon to be shot down as soon as possible without causing damage to anyone on the ground. The Pentagon decided that the best time to do this was when the balloon was over water, within the 12-mile limit. The President commended the aviators for successfully taking down the balloon. When asked about China, the President did not provide a direct answer.
