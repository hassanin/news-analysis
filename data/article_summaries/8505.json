President Biden is taking action to respond to the increase in gas prices caused by Putin's actions in Ukraine. Gas prices have fallen significantly this summer, with an average decrease of $1.15 per gallon since June. The Department of Energy is selling 15 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in December to address the supply crunch and lower costs. The President is also planning to repurchase crude oil for the SPR when prices are at or below $67-$72 per barrel to increase global demand and encourage investment in production. Additionally, the President is urging companies to pass on their savings from lower energy costs to consumers. The SPR remains the largest strategic reserve in the world, and the President is prepared to authorize more sales if necessary. The Administration is committed to replenishing the SPR in a way that protects taxpayer interests and encourages immediate investment in production. The Department of Energy has finalized a rule that allows for fixed-price contracts to repurchase oil for the SPR, targeting a price of $67-$72 per barrel or lower. This approach benefits taxpayers by refilling the SPR at a lower price and provides certainty for producers to make investment decisions.
