On July 17, 2019, President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation to honor the memory and service of John Paul Stevens, a retired Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The proclamation orders that on the day of Stevens' interment, the flag of the United States should be flown at half-staff at the White House, all public buildings and grounds, military posts and naval stations, and all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia, throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset. The flag should also be flown at half-staff for the same period at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including military facilities and naval vessels and stations.
