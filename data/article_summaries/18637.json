President Barack Obama issued a statement expressing his gratitude to the United States Senate for extending the "Cash for Clunkers" program. He believes that this extension will allow more American consumers to purchase newer, more fuel-efficient cars, providing a boost to the economy. The program has been successful in increasing fuel economy by over 50% and reducing gas costs for consumers by $700 to $1000 annually. Additionally, it has helped remove old, polluting vehicles from the road. The President also acknowledged the positive impact of the program on businesses, particularly in the auto industry, by creating jobs. He thanked Senate Leader Reid and the members of the Senate for their swift action in extending the program.
