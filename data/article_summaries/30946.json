The United States observes National HIV Testing Day in June each year. Currently, around 1.2 million people in the country are living with HIV, with 1 in 7 unaware of their status. Despite a drop in infections since the 1980s, nearly 40,000 Americans are still diagnosed with HIV annually, and 80% of new infections are transmitted by undiagnosed or untreated individuals. The US aims to continue leading in prevention, research, treatment, and cures for HIV. The availability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly reduced virus transmission and improved health outcomes. To address the gap between testing and treatment, the US launched the "Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America" initiative, which includes a $716 million budget request for 2021. The goal is to prevent HIV spread, provide better care, and protect those living with the virus. The initiative aims to reduce transmissions and create healthier and safer communities. The US is committed to using prevention, testing, and treatment tools to end HIV globally.
