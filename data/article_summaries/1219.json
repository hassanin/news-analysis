Today, Texas law SB8 came into effect, which has been criticized for violating the constitutional right established in Roe v. Wade. The law will limit women's access to healthcare, particularly for marginalized communities. What makes it even more controversial is that it allows private citizens to sue anyone they believe has aided someone in getting an abortion, potentially including family members, healthcare workers, clinic staff, or even strangers. The current administration is committed to protecting and defending the right established in Roe v. Wade.
