The Obama Administration has announced the establishment of the Advanced Regenerative Manufacturing Institute (ARMI) in Manchester, NH. ARMI will bring together a consortium of 87 partners from industry, academia, and government to develop manufacturing technologies for cells, tissues, and organs. The goal is to develop next-generation techniques for repairing and replacing cells and tissues, which could benefit wounded soldiers and civilians in need of organ transplants. This is the twelfth manufacturing hub awarded by the Obama Administration and follows two other hubs announced in the past two weeks. The Manufacturing USA institutes have attracted over $1.8 billion in non-Federal investment and are helping to strengthen American manufacturing.
