The Obama administration has taken action to reduce prescription drug shortages and fight price gouging. President Obama has issued an Executive Order directing the FDA to broaden reporting of potential shortages and expedite regulatory reviews. The order also requires the FDA to work with the Department of Justice to investigate illegal price gouging or stockpiling of medications. The administration is also backing bipartisan legislation to strengthen the FDA's ability to prevent drug shortages. The number of reported prescription drug shortages in the US has nearly tripled between 2005 and 2010. These shortages can lead to price gouging, with some drugs being sold at significantly higher prices. The Executive Order aims to increase early notification of potential shortages and require drug manufacturers to provide advance notice of manufacturing discontinuances. The FDA will also expand its efforts to expedite the review of new manufacturing sites and suppliers. The administration has sent a letter to drug manufacturers reminding them of their responsibility to report discontinuations and has increased staffing resources for the FDA's Drug Shortages Program. The Department of Health and Human Services has released a report assessing the factors that lead to drug shortages. While some solutions are outside of the FDA's authority, the administration will continue to work with manufacturers and stakeholders to address drug shortages.
