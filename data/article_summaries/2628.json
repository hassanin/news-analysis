White House Officials from the National Economic Council, Domestic Policy Council, and Office of Intergovernmental Affairs recently held a meeting with state legislative leaders from ten states to discuss housing affordability. The meeting aimed to build on President Biden's Housing Supply Action Plan and prioritize lowering costs for working families.

In October 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration made progress in implementing its Housing Supply Action Plan. This included finalizing regulations to facilitate the construction of mixed-income housing, extending Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) deadlines, streamlining financing programs through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and promoting housing options near transit.

During the meeting, White House Officials expressed their desire to collaborate with state and local governments in expanding housing supply, strengthening tenant protections, reducing homelessness, and promoting housing equity.

Legislative leaders from California, Oregon, and Maine shared their successful experiences in passing comprehensive land-use reform policies to increase housing affordability. Leaders from other states discussed their plans to advance land-use reform legislation in the 2023 legislative session. The meeting also focused on reducing regulatory barriers for affordable housing, increasing funding for affordable housing, protecting tenant rights, ensuring fair housing access, and addressing homelessness.

The state legislative leaders who participated in the meeting were not explicitly mentioned in the article.
