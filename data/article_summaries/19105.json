President Barack Obama and other leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum have made commitments to advance women's economic participation. The UN estimates that the APEC region loses $89 billion in GDP annually due to barriers that prevent women from fully participating in the economy. Since 2011, APEC has focused on women's economic empowerment, with efforts in five key areas: women's access to markets, skills, capacity building and health, women's leadership, and innovation and technology. To turn this vision into action, the United States and APEC leaders have launched five regional initiatives. These initiatives include the establishment of the APEC Women and the Economy Dashboard, which tracks and measures progress in improving women's economic participation, and the Women's Entrepreneurship in APEC (WE-APEC) Network, which aims to connect women's entrepreneurship networks in each economy. Another initiative is the "Healthy Women, Healthy Economies" initiative, which seeks to enhance women's economic participation by improving women's health. APEC economies have also agreed to work towards increasing women's representation in leadership roles and to address labor shortages in the transportation sector by including more women in the workforce.
