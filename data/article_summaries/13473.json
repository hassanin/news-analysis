Vice President Joe Biden has issued a statement on the unjust detention of Nadiya Savchenko in Russia. Savchenko, a member of the Ukrainian armed forces, was abducted by separatists and taken across the border against her will in 2014. Despite her imprisonment, she was elected to the Ukrainian Rada. Biden calls for her immediate release, citing Russia's violation of the Minsk agreements. Savchenko has recently started a hunger strike to protest her detention, and her health is deteriorating. Biden urges Russia to drop all charges against her and allow her to return home to her family and participate in shaping a new Ukraine.
