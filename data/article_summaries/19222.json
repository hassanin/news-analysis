The United States and Germany have successfully removed excess plutonium and highly enriched uranium (HEU) from Germany as part of their efforts on nuclear security. This is the 19th shipment of nuclear material from Germany to the United States since 1996. The project involved collaboration between the U.S. Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE/NNSA), Germany's Wiederaufarbeitungsanlage Karlsruhe RÃ¼ckbau-und Entsorgungs-GmbH (WAK), and the European Commission Joint Research Centre's Institute for Transuranium Elements (JRC-ITU). Technical challenges were overcome, including the design, construction, and qualification of new gloveboxes for packaging the materials, as well as the development of processes for safe transport. Germany's Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building, and Nuclear Safety (BMUB), and its licensing authority, the Federal Office of Radiation Protection (BfS), played a significant role in approving the necessary licenses for safe packaging and transport. Secure transport was provided by Germany's Daher Nuclear Technologies GmBH within the country and the United Kingdom's International Nuclear Services from Germany to the United States. The European Commission's Euratom Supply Agency (ESA) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) were also involved. The material will be stored in safe and secure facilities in the United States, and both countries plan to continue working together on nuclear security and non-proliferation.
