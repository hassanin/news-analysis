The Obama Administration is celebrating the five-year anniversary of Challenge.gov, a historic effort by the Federal Government to collaborate with the public through incentive prizes to address various challenges. Federal agencies have collaborated with over 200,000 citizen solvers in more than 440 challenges, on topics ranging from accelerating the deployment of solar energy to combating breast cancer. To mark the milestone anniversary, the Administration is announcing nine new challenges from Federal agencies, expanding support for use of challenges and prizes, and multiple non-governmental institutions are announcing 14 new challenges. In addition, the General Services Administration (GSA) is launching new tools and a mentorship program to help agencies design and execute more ambitious prizes and challenges. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is opening the Global Innovation Exchange, a global marketplace for development innovation. Several foundations, industry, non-profits, and others are also responding to the Administrationâ€™s call to action by launching new prize efforts in areas such as health, environment, and education. Overall, the use of incentive prizes and challenges has proven to be a successful approach for the government and participants, providing unique benefits and increasing the overall amount of investment.
