President Obama has named 103 mathematics and science teachers as recipients of the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching. The winners, who teach grades 7-12, were selected by a panel of scientists, mathematicians, and educators. Each winner will receive a $10,000 award from the National Science Foundation and a trip to Washington, D.C. for an awards ceremony and educational events. The Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching is part of the President's "Educate to Innovate" initiative, which aims to promote STEM education.
