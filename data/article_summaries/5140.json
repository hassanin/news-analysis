In a press conference held in the Roosevelt Room, President Biden announced additional steps being taken to support Ukraine and hold Russia accountable for its actions. He mentioned that Russian forces have retreated from Kyiv, leaving behind evidence of their atrocities and war crimes against the Ukrainian people. The United States is providing Ukraine with the necessary weapons, equipment, and ammunition to defend itself, including heavy artillery weapons and tactical drones. President Biden also highlighted the significant support from the international community and announced an additional $500 million in economic assistance to Ukraine. He discussed a new program called "Unite for Ukraine," which will facilitate secure, legal migration from Europe to the United States for Ukrainians seeking refuge. The President emphasized the need to continue pressuring Russia and maintaining the unity of the international community. He also mentioned that a supplemental budget request will be sent to Congress to ensure uninterrupted support for Ukraine. Additionally, President Biden announced a ban on Russian-affiliated ships from US ports and shores. He expressed confidence in the US's capacity to sustain military support for Ukraine and urged the international community to continue economic sanctions against Russia. The exact amount of funding requested in the supplemental budget is yet to be decided.
