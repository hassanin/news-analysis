President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation declaring April 2018 as National Donate Life Month in the United States. The proclamation recognizes and honors organ and tissue donors for their decision to give the gift of life to those in need. It also acknowledges the efforts of medical professionals, scientists, and researchers who work towards improving the health of others. The proclamation highlights the importance of raising awareness about organ donation, as there is still a gap between the availability of organs and the number of people awaiting a transplant. It states that nearly 115,000 Americans are currently on the national transplant waiting list, with a new name added every 10 minutes. The proclamation encourages all Americans, regardless of gender, age, race, ethnicity, or economic status, to consider becoming organ and tissue donors. It emphasizes that one donor can save up to 8 lives through organ donation and enhance the lives of up to 50 people through tissue donation. The proclamation calls upon health professionals, volunteers, educators, government agencies, faith-based and community groups, and private organizations to help raise awareness about the urgent need for organ and tissue donors.
