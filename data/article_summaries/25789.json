On January 7, 2019, the President signed two bills into law. The first one is the "National Integrated Drought Information System Reauthorization Act of 2018" (S. 2200), which reauthorizes and amends provisions of various programs related to drought information, weather services, oceanic and atmospheric research, and harmful algal bloom program. The second one is the "Victims of Child Abuse Act Reauthorization Act of 2018" (S. 2961), which authorizes appropriations for Justice Department grant programs that assist in responding to victims of child abuse and improving the quality of criminal prosecution in child abuse cases. It also provides immunity for individuals who report suspected or known instances of child abuse or neglect in good faith.
