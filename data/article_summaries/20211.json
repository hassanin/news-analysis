The White House has announced the release of two U.S. citizens who were detained in Yemen earlier this year. The individuals have since arrived in Oman, where they were met by U.S. officials who will provide them with consular assistance. The U.S. government has been in regular contact with their families and representatives since their detention and has worked tirelessly, in coordination with international partners, to secure their release. The Government of Oman, under the leadership of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said, played a crucial role in achieving this outcome. The release of these citizens highlights the U.S. government's commitment to securing the release of all Americans detained abroad unjustly. The statement also emphasizes the need for an immediate resumption of peace talks in Yemen, as the people of Yemen want the fighting to end. All parties are urged to participate in these peace talks without any preconditions, with the belief that all of Yemen's diverse communities have important roles to play in the nation's peaceful governance.
