The Biden-Harris Administration held a meeting with officials and stakeholders to discuss strengthening tenant protections and improving rental affordability. Key topics included the right to safe and affordable housing, fair leases, protection from retaliation, and the right to organize. Administration officials emphasized their commitment to enforcing the Fair Housing Act and preventing discrimination. Lessons learned from the pandemic, such as eviction diversion, were also discussed.
