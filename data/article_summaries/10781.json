The Obama Administration has announced the winners of $150 million in TechHire Partnership grants, with $126 million specifically targeted towards at-risk and disadvantaged young Americans. These grants aim to expand access to tech talent and training in communities across the country. Tech jobs are seen as a pathway to the middle class, with studies showing that these jobs pay one and a half times the average wage of a private-sector job. There is a high demand for tech workers, with over 600,000 open IT jobs across all sectors. New innovations in training and hiring, such as coding bootcamps and skills-based hiring approaches, can help meet this demand. The grants will support programs in 25 states and Washington, DC, with a focus on expanding access to accelerated learning options, using data and innovative hiring practices, offering specialized training strategies, and emphasizing inclusion. The grants also include $24 million to connect people with criminal records, people with limited English proficiency, and people with disabilities to in-demand jobs. Additionally, $36 million will support workers in rural communities in retooling and retraining for new jobs.
