President Obama has announced a new target to cut net greenhouse gas emissions in the US by 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. This target will double the pace of carbon pollution reduction from 1.2 percent per year on average during the 2005-2020 period to 2.3-2.8 percent per year on average between 2020 and 2025. Meanwhile, President Xi Jinping of China has announced targets to peak CO2 emissions around 2030 and increase the non-fossil fuel share of all energy to around 20 percent by 2030. The US and China account for over one third of global greenhouse gas emissions. This joint announcement is part of the effort to achieve the deep decarbonization of the global economy over time and will inject momentum into the global climate negotiations. The United States will submit its 2025 target to the Framework Convention on Climate Change as an “Intended Nationally Determined Contribution” by the first quarter of 2015. The US and China are also expanding their cooperation on climate and clean energy, including joint clean energy research and development, carbon capture and storage demonstrations, cooperation on hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and the launch of a Climate-Smart/Low-Carbon Cities Initiative.
