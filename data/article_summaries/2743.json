During National Mentoring Month, President Biden celebrates the importance of mentors and their impact on the lives of young people. The administration has been working to support mentorship relationships in schools, communities, and the workforce. The American Rescue Plan provided $130 billion for K-12 schools, allowing for the hiring of more teachers, counselors, and supportive staff, as well as the implementation of tutoring and after-school programs. Funding for AmeriCorps was also increased to expand service options and recruit new mentors. The National Partnership for Student Success aims to recruit 250,000 adults by 2025 to mentor and coach young people. Additionally, the administration has invested in pre-apprenticeship and Registered Apprenticeship programs and created the American Climate Corps to provide workforce training and job opportunities. President Biden encourages Americans to become mentors or tutors and emphasizes the importance of preparing the next generation for success. He proclaims January 2024 as National Mentoring Month and calls upon Americans to observe the month with mentoring activities and programs.
