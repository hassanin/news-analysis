President Obama and the First Lady will host Prime Minister David Cameron of the United Kingdom and his wife, Samantha Cameron, for an official visit to the White House on March 13-14, 2012. The visit aims to highlight the strong relationship between the U.S. and the UK, as well as the personal bond between the two leaders and their families. It will also recognize the valor and sacrifice of the armed forces of both countries and their tradition of standing together in defense of shared values. The visit will emphasize the economic links between the two nations, which contribute to job creation on both sides of the Atlantic. This visit is a reciprocal gesture following the State Visit of President Obama and Mrs. Obama to the UK in 2011. During the visit, the President and the Prime Minister are expected to discuss various global issues, including Afghanistan, the Middle East, Iran, human rights, and economic stability and growth. They will also review the progress of initiatives launched during President Obama's previous state visit to the UK.
