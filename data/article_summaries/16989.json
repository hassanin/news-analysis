The Obama Administration has announced several steps to combat money laundering, corruption, and tax evasion. The United States has been a leader in global efforts to address these issues, and today's actions aim to further strengthen the financial system and promote transparency. The Administration is implementing new rules and proposing legislation to increase transparency and disclosure requirements for financial institutions. These measures will help law enforcement detect and disrupt illicit financial activity, terrorist financing, and tax evasion. The Administration is also calling on Congress to take additional action, such as approving tax treaties that would help crack down on offshore tax evasion. The Treasury Department is releasing draft legislation that would require companies to report the "beneficial ownership" of corporations, and the Department of Justice is proposing legislation to enhance efforts to combat transnational corruption. The Administration is also urging Congress to strengthen the United States' ability to work with other countries to fight tax evasion. These actions build upon previous efforts by the Obama Administration to enhance financial transparency and combat illicit financial activity.
