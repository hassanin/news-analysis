Senate Democrats attempted to adopt a resolution that would have rolled back President Trump's policies on healthcare expansion through state innovation waivers. The resolution was aimed at making health insurance more affordable, but the Trump administration argues that it would discourage states from developing strategies to provide high-quality care. Thirteen states, both Republican and Democrat-led, are already using innovation waivers to offer more affordable health insurance options. The Democrats' resolution failed to pass, and the Trump administration maintains its commitment to affordable healthcare options for American families and workers.
