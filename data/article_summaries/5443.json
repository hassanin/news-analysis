The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Administration for Community Living is releasing $1.4 billion in funding from the American Rescue Plan for Older Americans Act programs. The funding will support vaccine outreach and coordination, address social isolation, provide family caregiver support, offer nutrition support, and fund justice programs to ensure the safety and protection of older adults. The announcement coincides with the presidential proclamation honoring May 2021 as Older Americans Month, recognizing the challenges faced by older Americans and their families during the last year. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to expanding access to healthcare, nutrition services, caregiving, and opportunities to age in place for all older Americans. In addition to the funding, the administration has taken steps to expand funding for home and community-based services, increase access to affordable housing for seniors, provide COVID-19 vaccinations and testing for elderly residents of HUD-assisted housing, and expand nutrition assistance for low-income seniors. The administration has also proposed robust investments in the caregiving economy, aiming to expand access to long-term services and supports for older Americans and support well-paying caregiving jobs.
