On December 17, 2019, President Donald Trump issued an executive order stating that all executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government will be closed and their employees excused from duty on Tuesday, December 24, 2019, which is the day before Christmas Day. However, the heads of these departments and agencies may determine that certain offices and installations must remain open and certain employees must report for duty on December 24 for reasons of national security, defense, or other public need. The order also states that December 24, 2019, will be considered within the scope of previous executive orders and statutes regarding the pay and leave of employees of the United States. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management is responsible for implementing this order. The order is subject to applicable law and the availability of appropriations and does not affect the authority granted by law to executive departments or agencies, or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It also does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
