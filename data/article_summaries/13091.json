The President of the United States has signed an Executive Order imposing sanctions on senior Syrian officials and other Syrian and Iranian government entities responsible for human rights abuses. These sanctions are in addition to existing ones maintained by the United States. The Commerce Department has also revoked certain commercial export licenses relating to VIP aircraft used by the Syrian government. The United States believes that Syria's actions towards its people warrant a strong international response, and welcomes the decision by the UN Human Rights Council to condemn the Syrian government. The US strongly supports a resolution passed in Geneva, which includes a mandate for an urgent investigation into alleged violations of international human rights law. The US calls on President Assad to change his course and listen to the demands of the Syrian people.
