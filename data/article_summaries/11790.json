On March 21, 2011, President Barack Obama sent a letter to the Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate regarding the commencement of operations in Libya. The letter explains that at the direction of the President, U.S. military forces began operations to assist an international effort authorized by the United Nations Security Council to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe and address the threat to international peace and security posed by the crisis in Libya. The operations involve strikes against air defense systems and military airfields to establish a no-fly zone, with the purpose of supporting an international coalition in enforcing the terms of the UN Security Council Resolution 1973. The letter also states that Muammar Qadhafi was provided with a clear message to implement an immediate cease-fire, but he failed to do so and continued attacks on civilians and civilian areas. The President highlights the grave concern of neighboring Arab nations and the threat to the region and international peace and security. The United States has not deployed ground forces into Libya and is conducting a limited mission to protect civilians and prevent a humanitarian disaster. The President expresses his intention to seek a transition of operations to other organizations as necessary. The actions taken are in the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and are conducted under the President's constitutional authority as Commander in Chief. The President provides this report to keep Congress informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution.
