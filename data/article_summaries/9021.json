In a recent address to the nation, President Biden discussed the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and outlined his plan to combat the virus. He emphasized that despite the challenges posed by the Delta variant, the country has the tools to fight the virus and turn the tide if everyone comes together. The President highlighted the progress made in terms of vaccinations, with over 175 million Americans now fully vaccinated. He also acknowledged the frustration with the nearly 80 million Americans who have not yet received the vaccine, despite its safety and efficacy. President Biden expressed concern about the impact of the unvaccinated on the healthcare system and urged them to get vaccinated. 

To address the issue of low vaccination rates, President Biden announced a new plan that includes several measures. First, the Department of Labor will develop an emergency rule requiring all employers with 100 or more employees to ensure their workforce is fully vaccinated or undergo regular testing. This requirement will also be extended to healthcare workers. The President will also sign executive orders requiring all executive branch federal employees and federal contractors to be vaccinated. Additionally, he called on governors to require vaccination for all teachers and staff in schools. 

President Biden emphasized the importance of protecting the vaccinated and announced plans for booster shots, pending authorization from the FDA and CDC. He reassured the public that fully vaccinated individuals are highly protected from severe illness, but boosters would provide even more protection. The President also addressed the issue of children's safety in schools, urging parents to get their eligible children vaccinated and emphasizing the need for others around children who are not yet eligible to be vaccinated to get vaccinated. He called on school officials to implement safety measures such as testing, masking, and adequate ventilation. 

The President's plan also includes measures to increase testing and masking. He announced the use of the Defense Production Act to increase production of rapid tests, which will be made more affordable and available through retailers. Free testing will be expanded at pharmacies, and $2 billion will be allocated to purchase rapid tests for distribution to community health centers, food banks, and schools. The Transportation Safety Administration will double fines for travelers who refuse to mask. 

President Biden also addressed the economic impact of the pandemic and announced steps to strengthen the economic recovery, including expanding COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan programs and providing additional support to small businesses. He also discussed efforts to improve the care of those who contract COVID-19, such as deploying military health teams and increasing the availability of monoclonal antibody treatments. 

In conclusion, President Biden urged Americans to come together and emphasized the importance of vaccination, testing, masking, and other safety measures to combat the virus. He expressed his commitment to protecting the American people and ensuring equity in the response to the pandemic. The President also highlighted the need to continue fighting the virus globally and announced plans to donate vaccines to lower-income countries. He closed by emphasizing the importance of unity and the belief that the United States can overcome the pandemic by working together.
