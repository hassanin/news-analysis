This article discusses an executive order issued by President Joe Biden to address the high rates of violence against Native Americans and the crisis of missing or murdered indigenous people. The order emphasizes the need for collaboration with Tribal Nations and Tribal partners to build safe and healthy communities and to support law enforcement, prevention, intervention, and support services. It acknowledges the disproportionate violence faced by Native American women, LGBTQ+ Native Americans, and Two-Spirit people within Tribal communities. The order aims to develop a coordinated and comprehensive Federal law enforcement strategy, strengthen non-Federal law enforcement efforts, improve data collection and information sharing, and enhance prevention, early intervention, and victim and survivor services. It also emphasizes the importance of consultation and engagement with Tribal Nations and Native American communities throughout the implementation of these strategies.
