The White House has announced $38.8 million in funding for 29 economic and workforce development projects in coal communities. The funding, which is part of President Obama's broader POWER+ Plan, aims to assist communities and workers affected by job losses in the coal industry. The projects will focus on diversifying local economies, creating jobs, attracting investment, and providing workforce services and skills training. The funds are expected to create or retain 3,418 jobs and leverage an additional $66,970,000 in investment. The projects are administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission, the U.S. Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration, and the U.S. Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration.
