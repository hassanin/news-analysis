On September 11, 2009, the White House issued a statement from the Press Secretary regarding the remedy to address market disruption caused by imports of certain passenger vehicle and light truck tires from China. The President signed a determination to apply an increased duty to all imports of these tires for a period of three years. This decision was made based on recommendations from the United States Trade Representative and in accordance with China's agreement to a special safeguard mechanism as part of its accession to the World Trade Organization. The additional duty will be set at 35 percent ad valorem for the first year, 30 percent ad valorem the second year, and 25 percent ad valorem the third year.
