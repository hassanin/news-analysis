The Biden Administration is allocating $1.7 billion from the American Rescue Plan to help states and jurisdictions improve the detection, monitoring, and mitigation of emerging COVID-19 variants. The funding will be used to increase genomic sequencing efforts, which is the process of decoding COVID DNA to detect potentially dangerous mutations in the virus. Currently, the original strain of COVID-19 only makes up half of the cases in the US, with new variants making up the other half. By scaling up genomic sequencing, the CDC and public health leaders can implement known prevention measures to stop the spread of these variants. The funding will also help increase the geographic coverage of sequencing efforts, allowing for faster detection of both existing and new variants. The first tranche of funding will be distributed in early May, with a second tranche to be invested over the next several years.
