The Commerce Department released data showing that real GDP grew at an annual rate of 3.5% in the third quarter of the year. This is a significant improvement compared to the decline of 6.4% in the previous two quarters. Analysis suggests that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 contributed 3 to 4 percentage points to this growth. However, while this positive GDP growth is a good sign, there is still a long way to go for the economy to fully recover. The labor market indicators, such as employment and the unemployment rate, typically improve after GDP growth, and sustained growth is needed to bring the unemployment rate down substantially.
