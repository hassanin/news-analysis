The article is an executive order issued by President Barack Obama in 2015, titled "Blocking Property and Suspending Entry of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Venezuela." The order states that the situation in Venezuela, including human rights violations, persecution of political opponents, curtailment of press freedoms, violence in response to protests, and public corruption, poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The order blocks the property and entry of certain individuals involved in these actions, and also prohibits donations to those individuals. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of State are authorized to take necessary actions to carry out the order, and reports on the national emergency are to be submitted to Congress. The order does not create any rights or benefits enforceable by any party against the United States.
