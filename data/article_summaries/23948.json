President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of New Jersey and authorized federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following a snowstorm that occurred in December 2009. The declaration allows for federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, repairs, and replacements of damaged facilities in several counties. The assistance also covers emergency protective measures and hazard mitigation measures statewide. Stephen M. DeBlasio Sr. has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
