The United States, Mexico, and Canada have fulfilled commitments made by their respective leaders to deepen economic cooperation and create quality jobs. They organized the first North America Semiconductor Conference in Washington, D.C., with the aim of strengthening the resilience of the semiconductor supply chain. The three countries also launched the North American Ministerial Committee on Economic Competitiveness (NAMCEC), which will align efforts at the cabinet-level to enhance regional competitiveness and productivity in various industries including semiconductors, clean energy, critical minerals, biomanufacturing, and information and communications technology. The governments, along with academia and the private sector, are committed to advancing collaboration in these areas and establishing biannual dialogues among officials. The goal is to enhance North America's position as a trusted supplier of semiconductors and related technologies and to support the transition to a digital and green global economy.
