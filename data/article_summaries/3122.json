The article summarizes a press call about President Biden's fiscal year 2024 budget. OMB Director Shalanda Young and Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers Cecilia Rouse discuss the budget's key values, which include lowering costs for families, protecting Social Security and Medicare, investing in America, and reducing the deficit. The budget proposes tax increases for the wealthiest Americans and big corporations, while ensuring that those earning less than $400,000 per year will not pay more in new taxes. It also aims to lower healthcare and prescription drug costs, strengthen Medicare and Social Security, and invest in American manufacturing, paid leave, and other areas. The budget forecasts steady economic growth and aims to reduce the deficit by nearly $3 trillion over the next decade. The officials also address concerns about taxes, deficits, and the potential for compromise with the GOP.
