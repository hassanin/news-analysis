The White House has unveiled WhiteHouse.gov/EarthDay as a resource guide for those interested in making a difference in their community. The President emphasizes the progress made in the past four decades, including cleaner air and water, reduced pollution, and the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency. However, he highlights the importance of citizens coming together to demand cleaner air, water, and food, and to hold polluters accountable.

He urges people to visit whitehouse.gov/earthday to learn how they can help and share their stories about making a difference.
