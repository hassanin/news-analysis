President Barack Obama has proclaimed October 17-23, 2010, as National Character Counts Week in the United States. During this week, Americans are encouraged to reflect upon the values of equality, fairness, and compassion that are fundamental to the country. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of instilling these values in children and grandchildren and highlights the strength and character that comes from recognizing ourselves in one another. It also acknowledges the countless individuals who contribute to their communities through acts of service and calls upon public officials, educators, parents, students, and all Americans to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
