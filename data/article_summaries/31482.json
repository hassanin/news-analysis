The Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Jim Carroll, emphasizes the importance of everyone's role in addressing the addiction crisis in the United States. He highlights the alarming number of lives lost to drug overdose in 2017 and the widespread impact of this crisis. President Donald Trump declared a national public health emergency and implemented an initiative to combat opioid abuse and reduce drug supply and demand. Carroll argues that the best approach to support this initiative is to focus on preventing drug abuse from occurring in the first place.
