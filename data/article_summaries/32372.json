In a speech delivered in Phoenix, Arizona, National Security Advisor Robert C. O'Brien discussed the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to the United States and its allies. O'Brien stated that the conventional wisdom that China would become more liberal over time was a mistake, and that the CCP remains a Marxist-Leninist organization with the goal of total control over people's lives. He highlighted the CCP's use of propaganda, control of information, and coercion tactics to influence both the Chinese people and the international community. O'Brien also outlined the actions taken by the Trump administration to counter the CCP's malign activities, including restrictions on Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, designating Chinese state-controlled propaganda outlets as foreign missions, imposing export restrictions on Chinese entities involved in human rights abuses, and addressing the influence of the CCP in international organizations. He emphasized that the United States will stand up to the CCP and protect American values and interests.
