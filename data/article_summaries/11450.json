President Obama has submitted trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama to Congress. These agreements aim to make it easier for American companies to sell their products in these countries and boost American exports. The President believes that these agreements will support tens of thousands of jobs in the US and promote products labeled as "Made in America." He urges Congress to pass these agreements quickly, along with the bipartisan Trade Adjustment Assistance agreement that will aid workers affected by global competition. Fact sheets on each trade agreement are available for more information.
