President Biden and Vice President Harris have prioritized rebuilding the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, rather than the top down. They recognized that the pre-pandemic economy had long-standing challenges, such as rising inequality and disinvestment in communities. They rejected the failed trickle-down theory that supported tax cuts for the wealthy and big corporations, and instead focused on investing in critical areas like infrastructure and education. Their economic vision, known as Bidenomics, is based on three pillars. Although there is still work to be done, Bidenomics has already shown positive results for the American people, including Latinos.
