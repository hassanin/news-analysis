The United States is deeply concerned about the detention of three American hikers in Iran since July 2009. Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal, and Sarah Shourd have been held without charge or access to legal representation. While the Iranian authorities have allowed a Swiss consular visit, the families have reported that the hikers' physical and emotional health is deteriorating. The US government believes that these developments are further reasons for Iran to release them immediately. The hikers have been detained for almost nine months without formal charges, which goes against the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The US government calls on Iran to resolve the cases of all missing and detained American citizens, including Robert Levinson, who has been missing since March 2007.
