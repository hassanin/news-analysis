President Biden spoke with Prime Minister James Marape of Papua New Guinea and expressed his regret that he couldn't personally travel to meet with him and other Pacific Island Forum leaders. The president emphasized the US commitment to the renewed partnership with the Pacific Islands and stated that Secretary Blinken would represent him at the US - Pacific Islands Forum meeting. President Biden also invited the Prime Minister and other Pacific leaders to Washington, DC later this year for the second US summit with the Pacific Islands Forum. The summit aims to enhance cooperation on various shared priorities, including combatting the climate crisis, increasing trade and economic ties, promoting maritime security, advancing sustainable and inclusive development, and increasing people-to-people engagement.
