The Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will coordinate all disaster relief efforts to provide assistance and support to the local population. FEMA is authorized to identify and provide necessary resources to alleviate the impacts of the emergency, with 75 percent of funding coming from the federal government. Alexis Amparo has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for the recovery operations in the affected areas. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
