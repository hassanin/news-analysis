President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. announced over $2.9 billion in new assistance from the U.S. Government to address global food insecurity in his address to the United Nations General Assembly. This new funding builds on the $6.9 billion already committed this year. The compounding impacts of the pandemic, climate crisis, rising energy and fertilizer costs, and conflicts have disrupted global supply chains and increased global food prices. The drought in the Horn of Africa has created a dire humanitarian emergency, with parts of Somalia at risk of famine. The new funding will save lives through emergency interventions and invest in medium to long-term food security assistance. The United States also convened a Global Food Security Summit to address the global food crisis and extreme hunger. President Biden announced additional investments, including $2 billion in global humanitarian assistance through USAID and $783 million in global development assistance funding, which includes contributions to the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program. The United States believes that overcoming global food insecurity requires collaborative partnerships with international financial institutions and organizations.
