President Donald Trump has declared January 21-27 as National School Choice Week in the United States. The administration believes that school choice, which includes options such as traditional public schools, charter schools, private schools, magnet schools, parochial schools, virtual schools, and homeschooling, provides opportunities for parents to select the best educational fit for their children. The administration emphasizes the importance of preparing students for the challenges of the future and believes that school choice can empower parents and strengthen the education system. Charter schools, which did not exist three decades ago, now enroll over 3 million students. The administration aims to expand access to school choice programs for families who may otherwise be limited to attending the school nearest to their home.
