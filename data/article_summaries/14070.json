The White House Office of the Press Secretary released a fact sheet on empowering America's agricultural sector and strengthening food resilience through the President's Climate Data Initiative. The initiative aims to use open government data and other resources to provide farmers, food distributors, and agricultural businesses with the information they need to understand how climate change is affecting their operations and how to prepare for it. The fact sheet outlines various commitments by federal agencies and private-sector collaborators, including convening meetings with industry leaders, launching new features on climate.data.gov, hosting workshops and innovation events, and developing new tools and services.
