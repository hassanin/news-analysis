President Obama has declared a major disaster in Maryland and authorized federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following a severe winter storm and snowstorm that occurred in December 2009. The federal funding will be available for emergency protective measures in several counties, including Baltimore, Cecil, Montgomery, and Queen Anne's. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has appointed Regis Leo Phelan as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Further designations may be made if requested by the state and warranted by damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA.
