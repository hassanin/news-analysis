The General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Trong, welcomed President Joe Biden to Vietnam and expressed gratitude for his contributions to strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the two countries. They discussed the significant growth of Vietnam-U.S. ties since the normalization of relations and the establishment of the Comprehensive Partnership. They adopted a joint leader statement to elevate the Vietnam-U.S. ties to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership for peace, cooperation, and sustainable development. The partnership is based on respect for international law, each other's political systems, independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. The two countries will strengthen economic trade and investment cooperation, scientific and technological cooperation, and work together on international conflicts. President Biden emphasized the importance of respect for human rights and the strengthening of people-to-people ties between the two nations. The progress made in the relationship between Vietnam and the U.S. was attributed to years of hard work and the ability to overcome the painful legacy of the war. The two leaders pledged to continue cooperation in areas such as clearing unexploded ordnance, remediating environmental damage, and accounting for missing soldiers from the war.
