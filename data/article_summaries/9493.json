Congresswoman Frederica Wilson expressed her support for the American Jobs Act, a bipartisan proposal put forth by President Obama to create jobs and stimulate the economy. She emphasized the importance of Democrats and Republicans coming together to pass this proposal, which would benefit teachers, first responders, veterans, construction workers, and working families. Wilson stated that the plan is a common-sense solution that has received bipartisan support in the past. She also acknowledged that the economic problems were not created overnight and emphasized the need for a long-term solution. The plan is fully paid for by asking the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share and closing corporate tax loopholes. It includes provisions to cut taxes for small businesses, put more money in the pockets of working Americans, and help the long-term unemployed support their families while looking for work.
