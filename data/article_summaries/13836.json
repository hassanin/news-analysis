President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Vermont due to severe storms and flooding that occurred between April 23 and May 9, 2011. This declaration allows for federal funding to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Affected individuals in several counties can receive assistance such as grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other recovery programs. Federal funding is also available for emergency work, facility repairs, and hazard mitigation measures. Craig A. Gilbert has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the area. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. Further damage assessments may lead to additional designations. For more information, contact FEMA.
