Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at an event about the administration's efforts to lower prescription drug costs for seniors in the United States. She highlighted the struggles that many seniors face in affording their medications and the risks they take when they cannot. The administration has taken action to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month, cap the total cost of prescription drugs at $2,000 a year, and make vaccines free of charge for seniors. They have also allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. Harris emphasized the importance of holding accountable those who prioritize profits over people's health. She concluded by stating that the administration aims to build a nation where everyone, regardless of wealth or connections, has the opportunity to thrive and live with dignity in retirement.
