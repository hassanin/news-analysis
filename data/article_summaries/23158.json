This memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama in 2013, suspends the limitations set forth in the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 for a period of 6 months. The Act called for the relocation of the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but this suspension was deemed necessary to protect the national security interests of the United States. The Secretary of State is instructed to transmit this determination to Congress and publish it in the Federal Register.
