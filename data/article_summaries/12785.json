President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Arizona, ordering federal aid to support recovery efforts following severe storms and flooding that occurred from October 3-6, 2010. The funding will be available to state, tribal, and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures will also be supported. Michael L. Karl has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and deemed necessary based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA at (202) 646-3272.
