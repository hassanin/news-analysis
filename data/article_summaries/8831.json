Ahead of the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision, Jennifer Klein, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, and Carmel Martin convened legislative leaders from eight states where reproductive rights are at stake. President Biden has called on Congress to restore the protections of Roe as federal law and has defended access to reproductive healthcare through executive action. Vice President Harris has also convened state legislators to discuss state-level attacks on reproductive rights. Republican state officials are planning to use every tool available to restrict women's access to healthcare, including potentially restricting access to contraception. Legislators in Nebraska and North Carolina are fighting attempts to roll back reproductive rights. The White House thanked the legislators for their leadership in defending reproductive rights and affirmed their support in fighting restrictions to women's healthcare.
