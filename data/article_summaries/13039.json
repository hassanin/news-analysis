President Obama commemorated the 10th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision in the case of Olmstead v. L.C., which affirmed the rights of Americans with disabilities to live independently. He launched "The Year of Community Living" initiative, directing the Health and Human Services Secretary and Housing and Urban Development Secretary to improve access to housing and independent living arrangements for people with disabilities. This includes increasing Section 8 vouchers and enhancing interagency coordination. The Obama Administration provided over $140 million in funding for independent living centers. While progress has been made, there is still work to be done to maximize choices and opportunities for individuals with disabilities. The President pledged to continue engaging with the disability community to achieve these goals.
