President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring April 10-16, 2016, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. In the proclamation, the President emphasizes the importance of providing resources and support to crime victims, regardless of their age, color, or creed. The administration is committed to defending the rights of crime victims, particularly vulnerable populations such as women, children forced into sex trafficking, and seniors exposed to abuse. The President highlights efforts to reduce violence against women, including untested rape kits and gender bias in responding to cases of sexual assault and domestic violence. The President also mentions the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing, which aims to strengthen public trust between law enforcement and communities. The proclamation calls on all Americans to observe the week by participating in events that raise awareness of victims' rights and services, and by volunteering to serve victims in their time of need.
