In this proclamation, President Barack Obama declares May 2011 as National Foster Care Month. He emphasizes the importance of providing opportunities and a loving home for the nearly half a million youth in foster care in the United States. The proclamation recognizes that children in foster care are not at fault for being in the system and deserve stability and a devoted family. The President highlights the Permanency Innovations Initiative, a program that aims to decrease the number of children in long-term foster care and invests $100 million in intervention strategies to help foster youth find permanent homes. He also encourages adoption, as there are over 110,000 children in foster care waiting to be adopted. The proclamation mentions the increased funding for foster care assistance programs and the provision of free meals for children in foster care through the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act will require states to extend Medicaid coverage up to age 26 for youth who have aged out of the foster care system. The President calls on all Americans to participate in efforts to improve the lives of young people in foster care and recognize the work of foster families, social workers, and community organizations.
