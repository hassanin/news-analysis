President Biden announced the launch of a new application site, StudentAid.gov, where millions of working- and middle-class Americans can apply for federal student debt forgiveness. The application process is simple, fast, and takes less than five minutes to complete. The relief program offers up to $10,000 in debt forgiveness, and up to an additional $10,000 for those who received a Pell Grant, for individuals earning less than $125,000 a year. Over 40 million Americans can benefit from this relief, with 90% of the relief going to people making less than $75,000 a year. The President emphasized that not a dime will go to those in the top 5% income bracket. Republican members of Congress and governors have opposed this relief plan, despite having benefited from pandemic relief loans themselves. President Biden assured that the student loan relief is affordable due to deficit reduction measures and emphasized the importance of going after fraudsters who prey on borrowers. The President shared stories of individuals who have expressed gratitude for the relief program, highlighting its positive impact on their lives. The new student loan application is now open at StudentAid.gov.
