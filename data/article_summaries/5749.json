The White House recently hosted a historic gathering of Black Cabinet members as part of Black History Month celebrations. The discussion, moderated by Senior Advisor Cedric Richmond, focused on the commitment to advancing racial equity and supporting underserved communities through the federal government. The participants highlighted the significance of Black leadership in various policy areas, including military service, housing, environment, foreign affairs, and the economy. The event included Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan, United States Mission to the United Nations Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Council of Economic Advisors Chair Cecilia Rouse, and Office of Management and Budget Acting Director Shalanda Young. President Biden had previously issued a proclamation on January 31, calling on the nation to recognize the contributions of Black Americans and work towards equity and racial justice.
