The Senate Veterans Affairs Committee has given its bipartisan support for Robert Wilkie to become the next Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Wilkie's previous experience as Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel & Readiness, his testimony before the committee, and his previous confirmations by the Senate demonstrate his qualifications for the role. President Donald J. Trump is committed to providing proper care for veterans and believes that Wilkie will continue the administration's work on their behalf. The full Senate is expected to confirm Wilkie soon.
