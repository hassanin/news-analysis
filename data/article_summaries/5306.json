President Biden will announce a new tax credit to fully offset the cost for small businesses and nonprofits that provide paid leave for employees to get vaccinated. This announcement comes as the administration expects to meet its goal of administering 200 million shots in 100 days. The president is calling on every employer in America to offer full pay to their employees for any time off needed to get vaccinated and recover from the after-effects of vaccination. The paid leave tax credit, signed into law in the American Rescue Plan, ensures that no small businesses or nonprofits will lose money by providing paid leave for vaccinations. The administration is committed to expanding paid leave more generally, and the tax credit enables employers with fewer than 500 employees to claim up to $17,110 for 14 weeks of paid leave for each impacted employee. Paid leave has been shown to be effective in stopping the spread of COVID-19.
