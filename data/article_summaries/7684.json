President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to global illicit drug trafficking, declared in Executive Order 14059 on December 15, 2021, will continue beyond December 15, 2023. The President highlights the significant impact of drug trafficking on the United States, including the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans annually, non-fatal overdoses, and drug-related violence. Drug cartels, transnational criminal organizations, and their facilitators are identified as the primary sources of illicit drugs and precursor chemicals that contribute to the opioid epidemic. The President emphasizes that international drug trafficking, the production and distribution of illegal drugs, the rise of potent substances like fentanyl and synthetic opioids, and the growth of internet-based drug sales pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy. Therefore, the President has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
