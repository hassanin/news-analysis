The White House and the European Council have issued a joint statement condemning North Korea's missile launch, stating that it defies UN resolutions and threatens peace in northeast Asia. They call on North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons programs, adhere to international norms, and work towards promoting peace in the region. The statement emphasizes that North Korea's development of ballistic missiles is aimed at threatening countries with weapons of mass destruction. The international community, including the UN Security Council, is urged to respond to this action. The United States and the European Union express their willingness to work with others to welcome North Korea into the international community if it abandons its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and threats towards its neighbors. They also state that North Korea cannot achieve international acceptance or economic development until it stops its threatening behavior and implements the September 19, 2005 Six-Party Joint Statement.
