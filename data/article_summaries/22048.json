They also express their concern for Orthodox Christians who have been persecuted and subjected to violence, and they call for the release of those who have been kidnapped. The Obamas stand in solidarity with Orthodox Christians and people of all faiths, and they pledge to continue working towards peace, justice, and freedom for all.
