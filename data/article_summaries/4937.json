President Biden spoke with Governor Pedro Pierluisi from Air Force One to discuss the immediate needs of the people of Puerto Rico following Hurricane Fiona. The President mentioned the surge of Federal support with over 300 personnel already assisting with response and recovery efforts. As damage assessments are conducted, the number of support personnel will increase significantly. President Biden emphasized his commitment to ensuring that the Federal team remains on the job, especially given Puerto Rico's ongoing recovery from Hurricane Maria five years ago. Governor Pierluisi expressed his appreciation for the partnership and support from the Biden Administration. FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell will travel to Puerto Rico to assess urgent needs as directed by the President.
