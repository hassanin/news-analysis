The President welcomes the introduction of the DISCLOSE Act, a strong bipartisan legislation aimed at controlling the influence of special interest money in American elections. The President believes that powerful special interests and their lobbyists should not be able to drown out the voices of the American people. The legislation would establish the toughest-ever disclosure requirements for election-related spending by big oil corporations, Wall Street, and other special interests. It aims to allow the American people to see clearly which special interests are funding political campaigns. The bill also seeks to prohibit foreign entities from manipulating American elections and close other special interest loopholes. The President hopes that Congress will swiftly consider and pass this legislation, especially in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, as it is a critical step in restoring the government to the American people.
