During a press call, senior administration officials provided more details on President Obama's announcement regarding the troop posture in Afghanistan. They highlighted the progress made in degrading and defeating al Qaeda and the significant drawdown of US forces in the country. The President's decision to maintain 8,400 troops in Afghanistan through the end of the year was based on a recommendation from the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The officials emphasized the importance of continued US leadership in the NATO mission in Afghanistan and the support for the Afghan government. They also discussed the role of the US in training, advising, and assisting the Afghan National Security Forces, as well as the focus on counterterrorism efforts. The officials mentioned that the US supports a political reconciliation process between the Afghan government and the Taliban, but noted that the Taliban must renounce violence, break ties with international terrorism, and accept Afghanistan's constitution. They did not provide specific details on the authorities and troop numbers requested by General Nicholson, but mentioned that the new authorities granted to the Department of Defense allow limited combat-enabling support to Afghan forces in certain circumstances. The officials also addressed the issue of safe havens for terrorists, acknowledging the need for continued pressure on Pakistan to root out terrorist networks and support a political resolution in the region. They expressed hope that Pakistan will enforce its commitment to not allow its territory to be used for terrorist attacks against its neighbors. Finally, the officials confirmed that the breakdown of the 8,400 troops between the train, advise, and assist mission and the counterterrorism mission is similar to the current balance.
