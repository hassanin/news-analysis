The President has announced two new nominees for U.S. Attorneys, who play a crucial role in upholding the rule of law as top federal law enforcement officials. These nominees were chosen for their commitment to enforcing the law, professionalism, experience, dedication to equal justice, and support for the independence of the Department of Justice. The President has proposed a budget that includes increased funding for law enforcement to address the rising crime rate inherited from the previous administration. Additionally, efforts are being made to tackle the increase in gun crime by increasing police presence, supporting community prevention programs, and cracking down on illegal gun trafficking. Confirming U.S. Attorneys is important for these initiatives. So far, the President has announced a total of 67 nominees for U.S. Attorneys. 

One of the nominees is Ismail J. Ramsey, a founding partner of Ramsey & Ehrlich LLP in Berkeley, California. He previously served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Northern District of California and has experience working at law firms and as a law clerk. Ramsey holds a J.D. from Harvard Law School, an M.B.A. from the University of California at Berkeley, and an A.B. from Harvard College. He is also a veteran of the United States Air Force.

The second nominee is Kate E. Brubacher, who has served as an Assistant Prosecuting Attorney in the Jackson County, Missouri Prosecuting Attorneyâ€™s Office. She has also worked at law firms in New York and as an analyst for a management company. Brubacher holds a J.D. from Yale Law School, an M.A.R. from Yale Divinity School, and a B.A. and M.A. from Stanford University. She was raised in North Newton, Kansas.
