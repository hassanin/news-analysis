President Obama has announced that Bristol Bay in Alaska will be off limits to oil and gas drilling. This decision aims to protect the waters that provide 40 percent of America's wild-caught seafood and support a $2 billion fishing industry. The area is also important for the commercial fishing and tourism economy, as well as for Alaska Native communities. Bristol Bay is home to the largest runs of wild sockeye salmon in the world and provides habitat for various species, including threatened and endangered ones. This action extends a temporary withdrawal that President Obama issued in 2010 and was set to expire in 2017. It builds on decades of efforts by local tribes, organizations, and businesses to protect Bristol Bay from oil and gas development. The decision honors the legacy of individuals like Harold 'Harvey' Samuelsen, a salmon fisherman dedicated to creating economic opportunities for Alaska Native and rural communities. The area in question, the North Aleutian Basin Planning Area, consists of approximately 32.5 million acres, and a portion of it was leased in the 1980s but never developed due to litigation. The previous administration had planned a lease sale for 2011 that would have opened around one-fifth of the planning area for drilling. President Obama's decision to protect Bristol Bay is based on his authority under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which allows the president to withdraw offshore areas from potential oil and gas leasing. This authority has been exercised by multiple presidents over the years. The Department of the Interior develops a new leasing program every five years for energy development in federal offshore waters, and the current program expires in August 2017. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is currently developing the 2017-2022 program, which includes opportunities for public comment.
