On February 24, 2016, the President signed two bills into law: H.R. 644, the "Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015," and H.R. 1428, the "Judicial Redress Act of 2015." 

H.R. 644 reauthorizes and amends existing authorities while also establishing new authorities related to trade facilitation, trade enforcement, and trade policy matters. 

H.R. 1428 allows citizens of certain foreign countries to bring civil actions against Federal agencies for violations of the Privacy Act of 1974, specifically related to the unlawful disclosure of records.
