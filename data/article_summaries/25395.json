Second Lady Karen Pence, in collaboration with American Corporate Partners (ACP), hosted a virtual summit on military spouse employment solutions. The summit included over 46 business and nonprofit leaders, military spouses, and representatives from the White House and ACP. Participants discussed specific solutions and commitments to address military spouse unemployment challenges, such as hiring, training, mentoring, licensing portability legislation, networking, and remote work opportunities. The goal was to create actionable plans for the upcoming year. Mrs. Pence emphasized that military spouses are highly qualified and dedicated workers. This initiative is part of Mrs. Pence's campaign, launched in September 2018, to support military spouses and address their unique employment challenges. ACP, a nonprofit organization, provides transitioning service members with free, year-long mentorships with experienced volunteers from various industries. The summit received praise for the commitment shown by companies in prioritizing military spouse employment.
