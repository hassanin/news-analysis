The Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, spoke at the COP26 climate conference in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. She highlighted the actions taken by the United States to combat the climate crisis, including the largest climate investment in the country's history, amounting to roughly a trillion dollars over the next decade. This investment is being used to build and expand renewable energy infrastructure, develop clean transportation, and reduce emissions in various sectors. The United States is also prioritizing equity by investing in marginalized communities that are disproportionately affected by climate change and fossil fuel pollution. Globally, the United States is a leader in expanding international climate finance, with contributions totaling over $9.5 billion this year, on track to reach President Biden's goal of $11 billion by 2024. Additionally, the United States pledged $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund, which supports developing countries in investing in resilience, clean energy, and nature-based solutions. The Vice President emphasized the importance of taking action to meet the climate crisis and called out those who deny climate science or spread misinformation. She urged for increased ambition, investment, and courage to reach the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Despite the challenges, the Vice President expressed optimism in building a cleaner, healthier, and more prosperous world for present and future generations.
