The White House is expressing deep concern over the continued use of mass trials and sentencing in Egypt, specifically regarding the recent death sentence against 683 defendants. The verdict is said to defy basic standards of international justice and goes against Egypt's obligations under international human rights law. The United States is calling on the Egyptian government to ensure that every citizen is afforded due process, including a fair trial and access to an attorney. The statement emphasizes that the repression of peaceful dissent will only lead to instability and radicalization. The United States supports the aspirations of the Egyptian people for a just government that respects their dignity and provides economic opportunities. A fair and transparent criminal justice system, free of intimidation and political retribution, is crucial for the success of Egypt's transition.
