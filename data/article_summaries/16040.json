President Obama has announced two new initiatives to improve access to digital content and public libraries. The first initiative involves major publishers making over $250 million in free eBooks available to low-income students, with the help of nonprofits and libraries. A new app will be created to deliver this content. The second initiative, called the ConnectED Library Challenge, aims to provide a library card to every student, ensuring access to learning resources and books. Over 30 communities have committed to taking on this challenge. The total value of these initiatives, combined with previous commitments, is over $10 billion, bringing the country closer to connecting 99% of students to high-speed broadband. Additionally, there are commitments from publishers, government institutions, and nonprofit organizations to support expanded access to free books and improve the e-reader app experience. Libraries are seen as crucial community anchors that can bridge the gap between schools and homes and provide educational services to everyone. The ConnectED Library Challenge will require collaboration between library directors, mayors, school leaders, and school librarians to ensure every child enrolled in school receives a library card. Over 30 major cities and counties have already committed to this challenge. The Institute of Museum and Library Services, Urban Libraries Council, and American Library Association are among the organizations supporting the implementation of the ConnectED Library Challenge.
