The Trump Administration is strongly against the "USA Rights" amendment to the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act. This amendment would reinstate the separation between intelligence and law enforcement, which was removed after the 9/11 attacks. The Administration is urging the House to reject this amendment in order to maintain the effectiveness of FISA's Section 702 authority in safeguarding American lives.
