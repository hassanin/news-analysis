President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Connecticut and has ordered Federal aid to assist with recovery efforts after a severe winter storm and snowstorm that occurred in February 2013. The Federal funding will be available to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, to help with emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The assistance will be provided in various counties and tribal nations within the state. Additionally, Federal funding will be available for snow assistance and hazard mitigation measures. Albert Lewis has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
