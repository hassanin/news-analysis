The White House has announced that the United States will provide approximately $400 million in assistance to the West Bank and Gaza. This funding will be used to improve access to clean drinking water, create jobs, build schools, increase affordable housing, and address health and infrastructure needs. The projects are a result of the advocacy and guidance of Palestinian leaders, President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad. The initiatives include a $240 million investment in a mortgage finance program, $75 million for infrastructure improvement, $10 million to enhance the private sector's competitiveness, $40 million to support UNRWA's emergency appeal, $14.5 million for school rehabilitation and community infrastructure in Gaza, $10 million for the construction of new schools in Gaza, and $5 million for water system repairs in Gaza. These projects aim to improve the lives of Palestinians and support the development of a viable, independent state of Palestine.
