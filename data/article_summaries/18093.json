The article is a presidential memorandum from September 30, 2009, regarding the fiscal year 2010 refugee admissions numbers and authorizations of in-country refugee status. The memorandum states that up to 80,000 refugees will be admitted to the United States in FY 2010 based on humanitarian concerns or national interest. The admissions will be allocated among different regions, with specific numbers for each region. There is also an unallocated reserve of 5,000 refugee numbers that can be allocated to regions as needed. The memorandum authorizes the Secretary of State to use unallocated admissions and transfer unused admissions between regions based on need. The memorandum also states that assistance to persons applying for admission to the United States as part of the overseas refugee admissions program will contribute to the foreign policy interests of the United States. It specifies certain groups of people in Cuba, the former Soviet Union, Iraq, and persons identified by a U.S. Embassy in any location who may be considered refugees for admission to the United States. The determination is to be reported to Congress and published in the Federal Register.
