The White House has announced the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Iran. This emergency was initially declared on November 14, 1979, due to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the situation in Iran. The emergency will continue beyond November 14, 2012, as our relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal and the process of implementing agreements with Iran is still ongoing. This action is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will last for one year. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
