According to a Commerce Department report, the US economy grew even faster than initially estimated in the second quarter of 2018. Gross domestic product (GDP) rose at an annual rate of 4.2%, the highest growth rate since the third quarter of 2014. This is an upward revision from the previous estimate of 4.1% growth. The report also showed that business investment and inventories contributed more to the growth than previously thought. This strong growth in the second quarter is attributed to the tax cuts signed by President Donald Trump.
