The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released its monthly Employment Situation Report, showing a strong American economy. The unemployment rate remained at 3.7 percent for the third consecutive month, and payroll employment continued to grow. This is the lowest unemployment rate since December 1969 and the fifth consecutive month it has been below 4 percent. Wages are also increasing, with nominal average hourly earnings rising 3.1 percent over the past 12 months. Real wages, adjusted for inflation, are also rising. The unemployment rate for African Americans reached a historic low of 5.9 percent, and the unemployment rate for individuals with a high school degree but no college fell to 3.5 percent, the lowest since December 2000. Despite the low unemployment rate, there are still potential workers who could contribute to employment growth. In November, total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 155,000 jobs, continuing a streak of positive job gains. Job gains were seen in most industries, with significant gains in transportation and warehousing and manufacturing. Overall, the report reflects the strong job growth under the Trump administration.
