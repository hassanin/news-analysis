Vice President Biden announced a plan to put one million advanced technology vehicles on the road by 2015. He visited the Ener1, Inc. factory in Greenfield, Indiana, which produces lithium-ion battery systems for electric vehicles. The company was awarded a $118.5 million grant from the Department of Energy to expand its production of advanced batteries. The plan includes supporting electric vehicle manufacturing and adoption through consumer rebates, investments in R&D, and a program to encourage communities to invest in electric vehicle infrastructure. The President's budget proposes transforming the existing $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles into a rebate available to all consumers at the point of sale. It also includes increased R&D investments in electric drive, batteries, and energy storage technologies, and grants for communities prioritizing advanced technology vehicle deployment. The plan builds on previous investments in vehicle technology and aims to reduce dependence on foreign oil. The Recovery Act has already increased U.S. manufacturing capability for advanced technology vehicle batteries and is supporting the deployment of infrastructure for these vehicles. The General Services Administration is also purchasing 100 plug-in hybrid electric vehicles as part of the plan.
