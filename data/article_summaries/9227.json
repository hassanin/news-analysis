President Biden is taking action to address the increase in gas prices caused by Russian President Putin. The Department of Energy has awarded contracts for the sale of thirty million barrels of oil as part of an emergency release to alleviate supply shortages. These sales will continue, and efforts have been made to secure an additional 60 million barrels from partners and allies. The Biden Administration is committed to reducing energy costs for American families by promoting clean energy and allowing the sale of E15 gasoline nationwide. Investments in clean energy are also being made to reduce dependence on oil and achieve energy independence.
