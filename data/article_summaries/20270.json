President Obama, Vice President Biden, and the First Lady are joining college presidents and education leaders at the second White House College Opportunity Day of Action. Over 600 new actions are being announced to help more students prepare for and graduate from college. The actions include building networks of colleges focused on completion, creating partnerships for college readiness, investing in high school counselors, and increasing the number of college graduates in STEM fields. The goal is to expand opportunities for low-income and underrepresented students and strengthen the middle class. The President has increased Pell Grants, created the American Opportunity Tax Credit, capped student loan payments, and laid out an agenda to reduce college costs. The actions taken today will reach hundreds of thousands of students in the coming years.
