Five Americans who were wrongfully imprisoned in Iran are finally being released and will be reunited with their families. The individuals, Siamak Namazi, Morad Tahbaz, Emad Sharghi, and two others who have chosen to remain anonymous, have endured years of suffering and uncertainty. The US government expresses gratitude to Qatar, Oman, Switzerland, and South Korea for their assistance in achieving this outcome. Special thanks are given to the Emir of Qatar and the Sultan of Oman for their role in facilitating the agreement. However, the US government also calls on the Iranian regime to provide information about Bob Levinson, an American who did not return. Sanctions are being imposed on former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence for their involvement in wrongful detentions. The US will continue to hold Iran accountable for its provocative actions in the region. Americans are reminded of the risks of traveling to Iran and are advised not to go there. The US government has been focused on bringing wrongfully detained Americans home and has successfully done so in various countries. However, there are still individuals unjustly held in Russia, Venezuela, Syria, and other parts of the world, and efforts will continue until every American is brought back.
