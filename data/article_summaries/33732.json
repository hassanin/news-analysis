The United States trade delegation, led by Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, traveled to Beijing at the invitation of Vice Premier Liu He and at the direction of President Donald J. Trump. The delegation held discussions with Chinese officials on rebalancing the economic relationship between the two countries, improving China's protection of intellectual property, and addressing policies that unfairly enforce technology transfers. The delegation emphasized that fair trade will lead to faster growth for both countries and the world economy. The high-level delegation reflects the importance that the Trump Administration places on securing fair trade and investment terms for American businesses and workers. The delegation will now return to Washington, D.C., to brief the President and seek his decision on next steps.
