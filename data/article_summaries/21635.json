This article is a notice from the President regarding the continuation of the emergency regarding export control regulations. On August 17, 2001, the President issued Executive Order 13222, declaring a national emergency due to the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979. Since the act has not been renewed by Congress, the national emergency declared in 2001 must continue beyond August 17, 2011. As a result, the President is continuing the national emergency for one more year in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
