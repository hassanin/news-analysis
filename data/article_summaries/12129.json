The First Lady and a Presidential Delegation recently traveled to Milan for the Milan Expo 2015. The theme of the Expo is "Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life," and the First Lady and the delegation are proud to share the successes of the Let's Move! initiative and learn from leaders from other countries about how they are addressing childhood obesity and promoting healthier families. During the trip, the First Lady participated in a cooking event with local Italian students, met with Prime Minister Renzi and his family, and toured the Italian and U.S.A. pavilions at the Expo. The Presidential Delegation includes several individuals from the government, as well as chefs, urban farmers, and representatives from organizations focused on health and nutrition. Through Let's Move!, positive changes have been made in the U.S., such as healthier school meals, increased physical activity, and reduced calorie counts in food and beverages. However, globally, obesity rates have doubled since 1980, and millions of children are overweight before they finish preschool. The First Lady is excited to join others at the Expo to tackle this global challenge.
