The White House has held a meeting with leaders from the private sector, academic institutions, and the U.S. Government to discuss a national cybersecurity labeling program for Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The aim is to strengthen cybersecurity and ensure that devices such as baby monitors and smart home appliances are protected from cyber threats. The labeling program would give consumers peace of mind and incentivize manufacturers to meet higher cybersecurity standards. The dialogue focused on implementing the program, improving security standards for IoT devices, and creating a globally recognized label. The initiative builds on previous work by the private sector and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in developing secure Internet-connected devices. The meeting included participation from major manufacturers and retailers, as well as government agencies. The White House plans to develop the program for a targeted rollout in Spring 2023.
