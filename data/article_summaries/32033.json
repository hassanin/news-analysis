The Trump Administration is taking action to address China's unfair trade practices, including the forced transfer of US technology and theft of US intellectual property. The US Trade Representative (USTR) has proposed a list of Chinese goods imports that could be subject to additional tariffs, valued at an estimated $50 billion. The USTR will undergo a public comment period and public hearing before making a final determination on the response. President Trump has also directed the USTR to determine if an additional $100 billion worth of tariffs would be appropriate. The Secretary of Agriculture has been instructed to implement a plan to protect American farmers and agriculture. The USTR has initiated a WTO dispute against China, is examining potential restrictions on Chinese investment, and is working with affected allies to restore fairness to global trade. The trade actions are a response to years of unfair trade practices by China that have gone unaddressed, and aim to ensure that China plays by the rules. The administration's actions follow an investigation that revealed how China's unfair policies and practices harm American commerce, causing tens of billions of dollars in damages to the US every year.
