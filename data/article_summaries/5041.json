President Biden has declared a major disaster in Tennessee due to severe storms and straight-line winds that occurred from June 25 to June 26, 2023. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in Fayette, Shelby, and Tipton Counties. The funding will be available to governments and nonprofit organizations for emergency work, facility repairs, and hazard mitigation measures. Andrew D. Friend has been appointed to coordinate federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
