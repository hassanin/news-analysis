The article discusses President Biden's executive order to establish a Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment. The order aims to promote worker organizing and collective bargaining in the United States. The Task Force, led by Vice President Kamala Harris, consists of various officials from different government departments. Its purpose is to identify policies, practices, and programs that can support worker power, especially in areas with hostile labor laws and for marginalized workers. The Task Force will also recommend necessary changes to existing laws to enhance worker organizing and collective bargaining. It will collaborate with relevant agencies and gather information from labor organizations and other experts. Within 180 days, the Task Force will submit recommendations to the President for actions to increase union density and promote worker organizing. The order revokes previous executive orders related to the American worker and includes general provisions to ensure its implementation follows applicable laws.
