During a press briefing aboard Air Force One en route to Morrisville, NC, Olivia Dalton, the Deputy Press Secretary, announced that President Biden will be announcing $82 million in investments from the American Rescue Planâ€™s Capital Project Fund to expand high-speed Internet access in North Carolina. Dalton emphasized the significance of this investment, as it will help connect thousands of homes and businesses to reliable and affordable Internet, bridging the digital divide in the state.

Dalton highlighted that when President Biden took office, 24 million Americans lacked access to the Internet, and many more had limited or unreliable connectivity. She mentioned that the President has made it a priority to end the digital divide and ensure that every American has access to high-speed Internet by 2030.

The announcement in North Carolina is particularly important because it is a state where one in three people live in rural areas, where Internet access is often limited. Furthermore, Dalton mentioned that North Carolina is a major producer of fiber-optic cable, and the investments being made will benefit local companies and create jobs in the state.

The briefing also touched on other topics, including recent airstrikes against Houthi missiles in the Southern Red Sea, tensions between Pakistan and Iran, efforts to secure the release of American hostages held by Hamas, and the ongoing discussions with Congress on various issues such as the border, Ukraine aid, and gun violence prevention.

Overall, the briefing highlighted the Biden administration's commitment to expanding Internet access, addressing national security concerns, and engaging with Congress on key policy priorities.
