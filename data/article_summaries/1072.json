The Biden-Harris Administration has launched the Talent Pipeline Challenge, a summer-long initiative aimed at filling high-quality jobs in infrastructure and supply chains in the US. The challenge seeks commitments from employers, education and training providers, governments, and philanthropic organizations to support equitable workforce development in three critical sectors: Broadband, Construction, and Electrification. Employers are encouraged to partner with training providers and hire skilled workers. Training providers, unions, and intermediaries are urged to commit to various actions, including expanding access to training programs. State and local governments are called upon to make commitments that support workforce development. The administration is taking various actions to support infrastructure workforce development, including allocating funding for job training and encouraging the use of funds for training in infrastructure programs. The Department of Labor is working to align workforce investments with infrastructure workforce needs, and the administration aims to support state and local partnerships utilizing funding for workforce training.
