President Trump signed the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act, which aims to increase access to education and job opportunities in science, technology, engineering, math, and computer science for veterans and military spouses. The bill directs the National Science Foundation to work with other federal agencies to expand veteran eligibility for STEM-related programs and encourage veteran participation in these fields. The President praised the bill and thanked the senators and congressmen involved in its development. He also discussed other achievements related to veterans, including the Veterans Choice program and the discharge of federal student loan debt for disabled veterans. The President also addressed other topics, including the stock market, the Roger Stone sentencing, his upcoming trip to India, and his views on Democratic candidates.
