The article discusses the Section 232 investigations, which help determine the effects of imports on America's national security. These investigations give the President the authority to address any threats to national security by restricting imports through tariffs. The Commerce Department issues a report to the President within 270 days of initiating an investigation, detailing the findings and whether certain imports pose a threat to national security. The President then has 90 days to determine whether he agrees with the findings and can use his authority under Section 232 to adjust imports as necessary, including implementing tariffs or quotas. President Trump has accepted the Commerce Department's conclusion that imported steel and aluminum pose a threat to national security and is taking action to protect America. The reports found that steel imports were nearly four times exports and aluminum imports accounted for 90% of total demand for primary aluminum. The Commerce Department recommended that President Trump take action to safeguard the long-term viability of the steel and aluminum industries in the US.
