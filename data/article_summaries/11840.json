First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden are hosting an event as part of their Joining Forces initiative to announce commitments that will strengthen the support provided to military and veteran caregivers. A report commissioned by the Elizabeth Dole Foundation estimates that there are 5.5 million Americans caring for service members and veterans, with 1.1 million caring for someone who served after September 11, 2001. These caregivers often face their own emotional, physical, and financial hardships. The Joining Forces initiative, started three years ago, aims to show appreciation for military families and provide concrete action to support them. In celebration of their third anniversary, new commitments are being made to support military caregivers, including legal and financial assistance, caregiver training, and expanded workplace flexibility. The Department of Defense is creating caregiver peer forums and online tools for caregivers to connect with their peers. Additionally, organizations are committing to train 10,000 caregiving peer mentors. These commitments build on the existing support provided by the military and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Eligible caregivers are encouraged to take advantage of the benefits and resources available to them. The Joining Forces initiative aims to connect military families with resources and rally the country to do more to support them.
