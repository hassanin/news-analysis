The White House Press Secretary, Jay Carney, gives a briefing on the effects of the government shutdown. He explains that small businesses are feeling the impact of the shutdown as key federal efforts that support small business have been halted. The Small Business Administration cannot approve new guarantees of loans provided by banks to small businesses, resulting in over $1 billion in lost loan assistance to small businesses and jeopardizing thousands of jobs. Carney also discusses the progress being made in the Senate to lift the debt ceiling and reopen the government. He emphasizes the need for Congress to take action in a way that does not have partisan strings attached and that ensures stability for the economy and middle-class Americans. Carney states that the President is willing to negotiate within the context of broader budget negotiations, but not in exchange for opening the government or raising the debt ceiling. He also addresses questions about the impact of a default and the President's role in the negotiations. Finally, Carney mentions the ongoing talks with Iran and the need for specific steps to address concerns about Iran's nuclear program.
