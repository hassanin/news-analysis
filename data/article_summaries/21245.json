The White House and the Department of Education have announced the start of voting for the winner of the first annual Race to the Top High School Commencement Challenge. Starting on Monday, April 26, the public will have the opportunity to review and rate a three-minute video and short essay from each of the six high school finalists. President Obama will select the national winner from the three high schools with the highest average ratings. The winner will be announced on Tuesday, May 4, and the President will visit the winning high school to deliver the commencement address. Voters are encouraged to rank the finalists based on criteria such as educational success, the ability to engage students in learning, and the success of the school in preparing students for college and career readiness.
