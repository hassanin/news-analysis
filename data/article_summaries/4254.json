President Joe Biden has issued a memorandum regarding the disclosure of records concerning the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The memorandum acknowledges the Congress's declaration that all government records related to the assassination should eventually be disclosed to the public. It states that the need to protect these records has grown weaker over time, and it is critical to maximize transparency. The memorandum temporarily certifies the continued withholding of certain information until December 15, 2022, to protect against harm to military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or foreign relations. It also mandates an interim release of information currently withheld from public disclosure on December 15, 2021. Over the next year, there will be an intensive review of remaining redactions to ensure transparency, with agencies only proposing continued postponement if necessary to protect against harm. The memorandum also addresses the digitization and online accessibility of the records, aiming to make NARA's entire collection available to the public.
