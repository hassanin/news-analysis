The United States strongly supports the Economic Community of West African States' (ECOWAS) decision to impose an arms embargo on Guinea and to develop targeted sanctions against individuals involved in the crisis. The US condemns the violence in Guinea and calls for cooperation with the UN Commission of Inquiry. The US also supports ECOWAS's decision to impose sanctions on Niger due to President Tandja's non-compliance with ECOWAS's request to suspend legislative elections. The US urges President Tandja to resolve the political crisis in Niger through dialogue and calls for the immediate imposition of full sanctions. The US looks forward to working with ECOWAS on democracy and the rule of law.
