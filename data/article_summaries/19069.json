The article discusses the Doing Business in Africa (DBIA) Campaign, a U.S. government initiative aimed at strengthening commercial relationships with Africa. Africa is experiencing significant economic growth, with a 5.4% growth rate predicted for 2014. U.S. goods and services exports to Africa reached a record high of $50.2 billion in 2013, supporting 250,000 U.S. jobs. The DBIA Campaign has four main objectives: connecting American businesses with African partners, supporting existing and new American investment in Africa, expanding access for American businesses to finance their exports to Africa, and reducing barriers to trade and investment in Africa. The U.S. government has announced $7 billion in new financing to promote U.S. exports to and investments in Africa under the DBIA Campaign. Additionally, U.S. companies have announced new deals worth more than $14 billion in clean energy, aviation, banking, and construction, along with $12 billion in new commitments under the Power Africa initiative. The U.S. government has also announced various resources and initiatives to support U.S. exports and investment in Africa, including commitments from agencies such as the Export-Import Bank, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency.
