President Barack Obama released a statement on April 16, 2009, regarding the release of certain memos issued by the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) between 2002 and 2005. These memos discussed interrogation techniques used on terrorism suspects during that time period. The release of these memos was required by the rule of law. President Obama stated that he had already prohibited the use of these techniques when he became President because they undermine moral authority and do not make the United States safer. He emphasized the importance of upholding both security and ideals, stating that these interrogation methods are already a thing of the past. The President acknowledged the need for transparency and accountability but also recognized the need to protect classified information for national security purposes. He consulted with the Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, and others, and determined that exceptional circumstances surround these memos, warranting their release. President Obama also assured those who relied on legal advice from the Department of Justice that they would not be subject to prosecution. He emphasized the importance of protecting the identities of those in the intelligence community and maintaining the classified nature of certain activities and information related to national security. The President expressed the need for reflection rather than retribution, acknowledging the dark and painful chapter in the country's history. He emphasized the importance of adhering to laws and core values, and taking steps to ensure that the actions described in the memos never happen again.
