The United States has welcomed the approval of new guidelines by the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) regarding the transfer of sensitive nuclear technologies. These guidelines limit transfers to nations that comply with nonproliferation obligations and meet standards for nuclear safeguards, safety, and security. The US is committed to ensuring that nations in good standing have access to peaceful nuclear energy without increasing the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation. This decision, along with the establishment of an International Atomic Energy Agency nuclear fuel bank in December 2010, aligns with President Obama's nuclear agenda outlined in Prague in 2009. It reflects the determination of nations to strengthen the international nonproliferation regime and establish new frameworks for civil nuclear cooperation.
