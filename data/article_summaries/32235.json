The Council of Economic Advisers has released a report stating that the Trump Administration's policies at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration have helped decrease the prices of prescription drugs for American patients. The report highlights the barriers to price competition in the pharmaceutical industry and the efforts made by the administration to streamline the drug application and review process, which has resulted in the faster approval of generic drugs. It estimates that lower prices from new generic drugs have saved consumers $26 billion through July 2018. The report also argues that the influx of new brand name drugs has implicitly lowered the price of improved health, providing an estimated $43 billion in annual benefits to consumers. The administration's American Patients First Blueprint, introduced in May 2018, offers strategies to bring down drug prices and enhance price competition.
