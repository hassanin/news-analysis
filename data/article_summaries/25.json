President Biden held a meeting with his Cabinet, economic council director, port envoy, and private sector leaders to discuss progress made in lowering costs for families by addressing supply chain issues caused by the pandemic. The meeting focused on port operations, retail inventories, trucking, and infrastructure investments. Participants noted improvements in moving containers at ports and efforts to stock shelves and move goods efficiently. The Department of Labor has streamlined its registered apprenticeship program to attract more truck drivers, and the administration announced $230 million in grants for port infrastructure development. The meeting also highlighted that package deliveries this holiday season have been mostly on time, and delivery times have improved compared to pre-pandemic levels.
