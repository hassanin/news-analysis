This article is a presidential memorandum issued by former President Barack Obama on December 5, 2013, titled "Federal Leadership on Energy Management." The memorandum emphasizes the importance of the federal government leading by example in creating a clean energy economy and addressing climate change. It sets new goals for federal agencies to increase their use of renewable energy and improve energy-management practices. The memorandum also directs agencies to update their building-performance and energy-management practices, encouraging the use of the Green Button data access system and the EPA's Energy Star Portfolio Manager. It establishes a target for federal use of renewable energy, challenging agencies to consume 20 percent renewable electricity by fiscal year 2020. The memorandum provides guidelines for achieving this target, such as installing renewable energy on-site, contracting for renewable energy projects, and purchasing renewable energy certificates. It also highlights the importance of reporting and accountability in meeting sustainability goals. The memorandum includes definitions of key terms and provisions for exemptions related to national security and intelligence activities.
