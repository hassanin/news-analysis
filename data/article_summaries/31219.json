President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed October 2019 as National Substance Abuse Prevention Month in the United States. In the proclamation, he acknowledges the devastating impact of substance abuse on families and communities and expresses commitment to ensuring the health and safety of Americans. The opioid crisis is highlighted as one of the pressing challenges, with over 399,000 lives lost to opioid overdoses from 1999 to 2017. While some progress has been made in combatting the crisis, illicit opioids and other drugs continue to fuel addiction. The National Drug Control Strategy, released earlier this year, focuses on prevention and includes education, treatment programs, and efforts to prevent the influx of drugs into communities. The administration has allocated resources, including funding of nearly $2 billion last month, to support the fight against substance abuse. The Fiscal Year 2020 National Drug Control Budget requests a record $34.6 billion for counter-drug efforts. The proclamation calls on various stakeholders, including parents, educators, healthcare professionals, and law enforcement officials, to join in the fight against substance abuse and work towards a drug-free future.
