The Biden-Harris Administration has announced state-by-state funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which will help states, localities, and tribes address home energy costs this winter. This funding is a result of the American Rescue Plan and represents the largest appropriation in a single year since the program was established in 1981. The plan has provided $8 billion in LIHEAP funding nationally, more than doubling typical annual appropriations. Additionally, the plan has provided resources for utility relief through the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) Program and State & Local Fiscal Recovery Fund. Fourteen major utility companies have made commitments to prevent shutting off utilities for Americans applying for aid and expedite assistance. The funding breakdown by state and territory is listed at the end of the article.
