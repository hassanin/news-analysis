The article is a statement from the President on the House passage of a historic education reform bill. The President expresses his gratitude to the House of Representatives for making progress on the reforms proposed to strengthen higher education and the early education system. The bill aims to provide relief to students and families by ending subsidies to banks and financial institutions and using that money to guarantee access to low-cost loans, strengthen Pell Grants and Perkins loans, and make college more affordable. The bill also includes plans to improve the community college system, simplify financial aid forms, and enhance early learning programs. The President looks forward to signing these reforms into law.
