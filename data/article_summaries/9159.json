President Biden and G7 leaders recently met with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine to express their support for Ukraine and impose further measures against Russia. These measures include sanctions on state-controlled media in Russia, banning certain services that finance Russia's war efforts and aid sanctions evasion, cutting off imports of Russian oil, and reducing dependence on Russian energy. The G7 also committed to imposing further export controls and sanctions to degrade Russia's war efforts. Additionally, visa restrictions have been imposed on Russian and Belarusian officials undermining Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity, or political independence. The United States also sanctioned executives from Sberbank, Gazprombank, Moscow Industrial Bank, and its subsidiaries.
