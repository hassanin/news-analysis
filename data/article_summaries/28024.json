During Antibiotic Awareness Week, the United States acknowledges the critical role antibiotics play in modern healthcare and highlights the importance of responsible antibiotic prescription. Antibiotics have transformed the world and increased life expectancy by combating deadly illnesses. However, antibiotic resistance is a serious problem that contributes to tens of thousands of deaths in the United States each year and can quickly spread globally. The United States is taking significant actions to combat antibiotic resistance, including the launch of the Antimicrobial Resistance Challenge by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Everyone, including food producers, healthcare providers, private-sector leaders, and the general public, can help combat antibiotic resistance by talking to healthcare providers about prevention and treatment, getting recommended vaccines, and taking antibiotics only when necessary. This week, the United States resolves to improve awareness of the threat of antibiotic resistance and encourages all Americans to learn more about the responsible prescription and use of antibiotics.
