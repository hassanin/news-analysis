The article discusses the economic case for the President's efforts to address "junk fees" on behalf of working Americans. Junk fees are hidden fees that consumers often encounter when making purchases, which can cost them significant amounts of money each year. These fees disproportionately affect vulnerable Americans and undermine transparent price competition in various markets. The President has called for action to crack down on junk fees, as it is a popular issue among Americans and has a strong foundation in economic scholarship. The article introduces a group of panelists who will explain the economic case against junk fees, including renowned economist David Laibson, psychologist Vicki Morwitz, former Federal Trade Commission Chair Bill Kovacic, and Laura Dooley from Stubhub. The article also mentions that some businesses and government agencies have already taken steps to provide transparency and eliminate junk fees in their industries. The panel discussion aims to provide more information and generate creative solutions to address this issue.
