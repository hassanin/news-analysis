This article discusses the 20th anniversary of Executive Order 12898 on Environmental Justice, which was issued by President Bill Clinton. The order aimed to address the environmental burdens disproportionately faced by low-income neighborhoods, communities of color, and tribal areas, such as contamination and poor housing conditions. The order affirmed every American's right to clean air, water, and land. The article highlights the progress made in the past two decades, including the establishment of national limits for toxic emissions from power plants. However, it also acknowledges that much work remains, particularly in addressing the impacts of climate change. The article calls for continued collaboration with states, tribes, and local leaders to improve the quality of life in overburdened communities and to reduce carbon emissions. It also encourages Americans to observe the anniversary with programs and activities that promote environmental justice and a sustainable future. The article concludes with a proclamation by President Barack Obama, calling for unity and action to ensure a safe and just environment for all.
