President Donald Trump has issued a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria will continue beyond May 11, 2018. The President cites the Syrian regime's brutal war on its own people, including the use of chemical weapons and support for terrorist organizations, as reasons for the continuation of the national emergency. The United States also condemns the Assad regime's human rights abuses and calls for a political transition in Syria. The President states that future changes in the composition, policies, and actions of the Syrian government will be considered in determining whether to continue or terminate the national emergency.
