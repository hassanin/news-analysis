President Donald J. Trump has signed an Executive Order to ensure that all Americans have priority access to free and safe COVID-19 vaccines. The order also directs his administration to develop a strategy for providing other nations with access to US government vaccines once all Americans have been vaccinated. The National Security Council will work on finalizing the strategy and coordinating its implementation. The US aims to lead in health and humanitarian assistance by saving lives and providing support to allies and partners around the world. The President's leadership has been instrumental in the development of COVID-19 vaccines through Operation Warp Speed, and the US will soon have safe and effective vaccines for its citizens. This action prioritizes the health of American citizens, strengthens the economy, and enhances national security.
