On November 27, 2018, President Donald Trump issued an Executive Order declaring a national emergency to address the situation in Nicaragua. This includes the violent response by the Nicaraguan government to protests that began on April 18, 2018, as well as the dismantling of democratic institutions, the use of violence against civilians, and corruption leading to the destabilization of Nicaragua's economy. The Executive Order blocks all property and interests in property within the United States jurisdiction of individuals determined to be responsible for human rights abuses, actions undermining democratic processes, threats to peace and security, deceptive practices or corruption related to the Nicaraguan government, or those who have materially assisted or provided support to such activities. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, has been delegated the authority to take necessary actions to carry out the Executive Order. All United States government agencies are directed to implement the provisions of the Executive Order.
