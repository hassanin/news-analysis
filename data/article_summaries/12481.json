The United States condemns the violence in Kenya's Tana River region, which resulted in the death of over 39 people, including women and children. This incident is an escalation of the violence that occurred in August and September. The US sends its condolences to the families affected and urges the Kenyan government, police, and community leaders to put an end to this cycle of conflict and work towards establishing lasting peace. With upcoming elections in March, peace and stability are crucial for Kenya's progress. The US encourages the people of Kenya to exercise their rights peacefully, as stated in the constitution, to achieve a secure, democratic, and prosperous future.
