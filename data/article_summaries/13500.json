On June 24, 2009, President Barack Obama sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 on June 26, 2008, will continue beyond its anniversary date. The reason for this is the ongoing threat posed by the existence and proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula. The President determined that it is necessary to maintain certain restrictions on North Korea and North Korean nationals, which would have otherwise been lifted in Proclamation 8271 of June 26, 2008.
