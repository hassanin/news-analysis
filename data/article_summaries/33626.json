On February 29, 2020, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation regarding the suspension and limitation of entry into the United States for individuals who were physically present in the Islamic Republic of Iran during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry. This was done in response to the sustained person-to-person transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (which causes COVID-19) in Iran. The proclamation aims to protect the security of the transportation system, infrastructure, and national security of the United States. Exceptions to the suspension include lawful permanent residents, spouses and children of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, and individuals traveling on behalf of the United States government for virus containment or mitigation purposes, among others. The proclamation is effective from 5:00 p.m. eastern standard time on March 2, 2020, and will remain in effect until terminated by the President.
