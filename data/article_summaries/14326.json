The Administration has announced new executive actions and signed legislation to improve the quality of care for nursing home and home health patients. The legislation, called the Improving Medicare Post Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (IMPACT Act), establishes new quality measures for nursing homes, home health agencies, and other post-acute care providers participating in Medicare. The Administration also plans to expand and strengthen Medicare's Five Star Quality Rating System for Nursing Homes, known as Nursing Home Compare. This rating system provides information to the public about the quality of care in nursing homes. The Administration will implement nationwide focused survey inspections to verify performance and improve the reliability of data displayed on Nursing Home Compare. They will also implement a system of quarterly electronic reporting to verify staffing information and revise the scoring methodology for the Five Star rating. In addition, the Administration issued a proposed rule to improve the quality of home health care received by Medicare beneficiaries. The proposed rule strengthens patient rights, improves communication, and focuses on patient well-being. It includes requirements for patient rights, comprehensive patient assessment, integrated communication systems, quality assessment and performance improvement programs, and patient care coordination. The IMPACT Act also establishes new quality measures for post-acute care providers participating in Medicare and funds the collection of staffing data for nursing homes. It also institutes routine surveys of hospice providers to ensure program standards are met.
