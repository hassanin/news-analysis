President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has expanded the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660 of March 6, 2014. He has prohibited new investment in the regions of Ukraine known as the Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) or Luhansk People's Republic (LNR), as well as the importation of goods, services, or technology from these regions into the United States. The order also blocks the property and interests in property of individuals or entities operating in the Covered Regions or providing support to those whose property is blocked. Additionally, the entry of noncitizens determined to meet certain criteria into the United States is suspended, except in cases where their entry would not be contrary to the interests of the United States. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, has been authorized to take necessary actions to implement the order.
