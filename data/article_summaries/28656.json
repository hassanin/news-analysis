The United States has designated both the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the Kingdom of Bahrain as "Major Security Partners." This designation recognizes the exceptional security partnership between the US and these countries, demonstrated by their hosting of thousands of US soldiers and their commitment to countering violent extremism in the region. Both countries have also participated in numerous US-led coalitions over the past 30 years. This decision represents a new level of partnership and a commitment to economic and security cooperation. It is also a recognition of their courage, determination, and leadership in entering into the Abraham Accords.
