This article is a Presidential Policy Directive outlining the procedures and requirements for implementing Section 1022 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. The directive emphasizes the need for the executive branch to utilize all elements of national power, including military, intelligence, law enforcement, diplomatic, and economic tools, to confront the threat posed by al-Qa'ida and its associated forces. It states that the executive branch has the authority to detain individuals who are part of or substantially supported Taliban or al-Qa'ida forces or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. However, a rigid requirement to place suspected terrorists into military custody would undermine national security interests, compromising intelligence collection and the incapacitation of dangerous individuals. Therefore, the directive sets forth policies and procedures to ensure that Section 1022 of the NDAA is implemented in a manner consistent with national security and foreign policy interests. It specifies the scope of procedures and standards for determining who qualifies as a "Covered Person" and provides waivers to protect national security interests. The directive also outlines the process for making Covered Person determinations, the implementation of those determinations, and the general provisions that must be followed in accordance with applicable law.
