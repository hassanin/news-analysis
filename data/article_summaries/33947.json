President Donald J. Trump recently spoke about the benefits of tax cuts for the typical American household. These tax cuts include an expanded standard deduction, an increased child tax credit, and lower tax rates. The Republican tax plan also aims to support small businesses, with more than 99 percent of them facing the lowest top marginal tax rate in over 80 years. The President believes that tax reform will lead to higher economic growth, wages, and job creation. The current tax code is seen as burdensome and complex, costing the economy $262 billion annually. It is also seen as uncompetitive and encourages companies to move jobs abroad. The President argues that now is the time to support American workers and reform the tax code.
