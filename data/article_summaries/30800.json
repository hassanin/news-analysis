On May 14, 2018, President Donald J. Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum regarding a Presidential Determination on foreign policy. The memorandum is directed to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of Energy. It states that, based on reports submitted to Congress by the Energy Information Administration and other relevant factors, there is a sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran. As a result, there can be a significant reduction in the volume of petroleum and petroleum products purchased from Iran by or through foreign financial institutions. The President will continue to monitor this situation closely, and the Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
