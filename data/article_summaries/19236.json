Senator Jim Webb, a Democrat from Virginia, has expressed his support for the Framework Agreement on Middle Class Tax Cuts and Unemployment Insurance. He commends President Obama for his leadership in reaching this agreement, stating that it shows great promise in reinvigorating the economy and putting people back to work. Senator Webb refers to the proposal as the "ultimate stimulus plan" because it will put more money directly into the pockets of individuals and small businesses, which will then be spent and circulated in the economy. He believes that the agreement will provide greater certainty for business and investment planning and extend programs that benefit working Americans and lower-income families. Senator Webb emphasizes the urgency of taking action now, as failing to do so will result in higher taxes for almost all Americans starting on January 1st, which would be detrimental to an economy that is still fragile and at risk of further job losses. He concludes by stating that the American people, especially those who are unemployed, cannot afford to wait for politics to hinder an effective bipartisan plan to stimulate the economy and restore growth.
