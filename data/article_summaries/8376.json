The U.S. has been in discussions with Israel about the importance of humanitarian pauses in the conflict in Gaza. The Israelis have announced two humanitarian corridors in the northern part of Gaza to allow people to flee areas of hostilities. The first corridor has already enabled many to reach safer areas in the south, and the second route along the coastal road will enable many more to do the same. The U.S. is urging Israel to increase the flow of aid and humanitarian supplies to the areas where people are moving. Israel has also announced four-hour pauses in northern Gaza each day, with no military operations during these pauses. The U.S. believes these pauses are a step in the right direction to protect civilians. The U.S. is continuing to work on securing the release of hostages held by Hamas and hopes that the pauses will provide safe passage for them. The U.S. will be represented by the State Department at the upcoming Paris conference and is focused on having constructive conversations. In regards to the e-commerce proposals at the World Trade Organization, the U.S. remains committed to an inclusive and innovative digital economy. The U.S. is also working on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and expects discussions to continue past November. The U.S. does not believe a ceasefire is appropriate at this time as it would legitimize Hamas' actions. The U.S. wants to see all hostages released and is working with regional partners on their release. The U.S. supports Israel's implementation of pauses and the increase in humanitarian aid and supplies. The U.S. is focused on getting Americans and their families out of Gaza and is working with the State Department on this. The U.S. believes that international law prohibits military operations on hospitals but acknowledges the challenges of targeting military operations embedded within civilian infrastructure. The U.S. is focused on ensuring the safe passage of civilians and the protection of hospitals. The U.S. does not negotiate in public but continues to work on securing the release of hostages. The U.S. is glad to see Israel's announcement of the pauses and believes they are significant steps forward. The U.S. is planning on attending the APEC Summit and is focused on a broad and deep agenda. The U.S. is not aware of any plans for President Biden to leave the summit early. The U.S. supports Israel's efforts to eliminate the threat posed by Hamas and will also continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people. The U.S. wants to see all hostages released and is focused on the safe passage of Americans and their families out of Gaza. The U.S. does not believe an Israeli reoccupation of Gaza is in the best interest of Israel or the Palestinian people. The U.S. believes in the right of the Palestinian people to determine their future and be governed by a structure that looks after their interests.
