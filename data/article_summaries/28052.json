President Donald J. Trump has authorized an increase in Federal funding for disaster assistance to the Hoopa Valley Tribe. The funding is for Public Assistance projects that were undertaken as a result of a severe winter storm from January 3 to January 5, 2017. Previously, Federal funding was available at 75 percent of the total eligible costs. With the President's order, the Federal share for Public Assistance has been increased to 90 percent of the total eligible costs. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
