In recognition of National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, President Biden emphasizes the need to understand and combat prostate cancer, which will affect over 260,000 Americans this year. He reiterates his commitment to ending cancer by supporting research, developing innovative treatments, and making healthcare more accessible and affordable. The President's administration has launched the Cancer Moonshot Initiative, created a Cancer Cabinet, and secured funding for the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) to advance cancer research. Additionally, efforts will be made to protect patients with preexisting conditions and make treatments more affordable, including capping out-of-pocket prescription drug costs and allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. The President urges increased awareness of prostate cancer symptoms and acknowledges that certain groups, such as men over 65, those with a family history of prostate cancer, and Black men, are more at risk. He encourages individuals to consult with healthcare providers, seek screenings, and learn more about the disease. The President calls for unity and collective action to protect future generations' health. As a result, September 2022 is proclaimed as National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, with a call for citizens, government agencies, businesses, nonprofits, and other groups to participate in activities that raise awareness and promote prevention and cure efforts.
