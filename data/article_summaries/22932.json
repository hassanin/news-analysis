President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Kansas due to severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred between May 19 and June 4, 2011. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The federal funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has appointed Bradley Harris as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
