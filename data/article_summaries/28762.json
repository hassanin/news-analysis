In this presidential memorandum, President Donald J. Trump directs the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a thorough review of the determination and designation processes of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The review is aimed at promoting market discipline and reducing systemic risk. The Secretary is instructed to consider factors such as transparency, due process, market participants' expectations of government intervention, evaluation of vulnerability to financial distress, quantification of potential damage to the economy, consideration of costs on regulated entities, reevaluation opportunities for entities, and provision of information on risk reduction. The Secretary is also required to evaluate whether FSOC activities are consistent with Executive Order 13772 on regulating the financial system and provide recommendations for legislative or regulatory changes if necessary. During the review, the Secretary is directed not to vote for non-emergency proposed determinations or designations. The memorandum includes general provisions that clarify its implementation and do not create any enforceable rights or benefits.
