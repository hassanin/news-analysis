The White House is calling on the U.S. private sector to make new commitments to help refugees. The call to action, announced by President Obama, aims to generate new commitments in three areas: education, employment, and enablement. Fifteen founding companies, including Accenture, Airbnb, Google, IBM, and Microsoft, have already committed to standing with refugees. The White House has also established the Partnership for Refugees, in collaboration with the State Department and USA for UNHCR, to provide guidance to private sector organizations and ensure their pledges are sustainable and responsive to refugees' needs. The call to action comes ahead of the Leaders' Summit on Refugees, which President Obama will host in September. The summit aims to generate increased support for UN humanitarian appeals, create more opportunities for legal resettlement, and increase access to education and employment for refugees.
