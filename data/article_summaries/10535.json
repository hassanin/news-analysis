President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation to honor the memory of John Glenn, ordering that the flag of the United States be flown at half-staff at the White House, as well as on all public buildings, military posts, naval stations, and naval vessels of the Federal Government. This order applies to locations in the District of Columbia, throughout the United States, and its Territories and possessions until sunset on the day of interment. The flag shall also be flown at half-staff for the same period at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including military facilities and naval vessels and stations.
