Karen Pence, the Second Lady of the United States, partnered with The Congressional Club to assemble 800 art supply kits to be donated to art therapists in 28 children's hospitals across the country. The art kits were made on behalf of Emma's Art Cart, a nonprofit organization started by Emma Stumpf, who was diagnosed with a brain tumor at the age of seven. Emma found comfort in working with art therapists during her treatment and wanted to provide the same experience to other children. Her program, Emma's Art Cart, aims to donate 150,000 kits to children's hospitals by the end of the year. Karen Pence commended Emma for her dedication and highlighted the importance of art therapy.
