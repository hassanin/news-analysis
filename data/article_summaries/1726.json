The Biden-Harris administration is implementing a Trucking Action Plan to address the critical shortage of truck drivers by recruiting and retaining well-trained veterans in the trucking industry. The Departments of Labor, Transportation, Defense, Veterans Affairs, and the Small Business Administration will be raising awareness about federal programs that connect transitioning military personnel and veterans to trucking jobs. The Department of Labor's Registered Apprenticeship Program will be a highlight of these efforts. The administration is also focused on using every tool at its disposal to bring down prices and ease supply chain bottlenecks. The President will be meeting with business leaders, traveling to Virginia, and hosting CEOs at the White House to discuss ways to lower prices and strengthen the economy. On the issue of the fair tax credit, the administration is encouraging Americans to take advantage of critical tax credits, including the expanded Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit. The administration believes that these tax credits help cut child poverty, provide families with extra breathing room, and support the development and opportunities for children. The President has accepted the resignation of Dr. Eric Lander, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, following an investigation into his behavior. The administration is focused on moving forward and continuing the important work of the OSTP. The President is committed to using every tool at his disposal to protect voting rights and ensure fair election maps. The administration is also monitoring the situation in Canada where truckers are protesting, causing disruptions and congestion. The White House supports the right to protest but emphasizes that the protests should not disrupt essential services or infringe upon the rights of others. The administration is closely engaged with Canadian counterparts to address the situation. On the issue of Russia and Ukraine, the administration is closely coordinating with allies and partners to deter Russia from further aggression. The President believes that there is still a diplomatic off-ramp for Russia and encourages diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the situation. The administration is prepared for a range of contingencies and is working to maintain a united front with its allies.
