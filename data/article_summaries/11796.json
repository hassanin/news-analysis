In this article, President Barack Obama emphasizes the need for substantive healthcare reform and urges both parties to come together to find common ground. He praises the achievements of American athletes in the Winter Olympics and highlights the unity and determination displayed during the games. Obama acknowledges the challenges of finding unity in Washington but emphasizes the importance of cooperation to address the nation's biggest challenges. He cites recent examples of bipartisan cooperation, such as the passage of a jobs bill and a healthcare bill in the House of Representatives. While there are points of agreement on healthcare reform, there are still differences, particularly regarding holding insurers accountable and providing tax credits to small businesses and individuals. Obama calls for resolving these disagreements and not missing the opportunity to solve the healthcare problem, as millions of Americans cannot afford insurance and cannot wait for future generations to act. He urges both parties to act responsibly and fulfill their responsibilities to the American people and future generations.
