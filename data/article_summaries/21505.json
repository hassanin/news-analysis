President Obama has declared a major disaster in Wyoming due to severe storms and flooding that occurred between May 24 and June 6, 2015. This declaration allows federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas, specifically in Johnson and Niobrara counties. The assistance provided can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the disaster. Federal funding is also available for hazard mitigation measures throughout the state. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has named Thomas J. McCool as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations for assistance may be made in the future if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance by registering online or by calling FEMA's toll-free numbers. The assistance hotline will operate from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. local time, seven days a week.
