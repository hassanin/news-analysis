The National Interagency Fire Center has predicted above-normal fire potential for much of the Western United States due to severe drought conditions affecting nearly 90% of the region. Climate change is a major factor driving extreme heat, drought, and wildfire danger. The number of large wildfires in the US has been increasing each year since 2015, and this wildfire season is already surpassing last season's numbers. To prepare for this wildfire season, the Biden Administration has held meetings on wildfire preparedness and prevention efforts. President Biden has directed actions to protect public safety and provide assistance during emergencies. The administration is also focusing on building a more responsive and resilient wildland firefighting workforce, extending the hiring of temporary firefighters, and transitioning to a more permanent firefighting workforce. Other measures include improving wildfire response capabilities, leveraging data and technology for early detection and response, and reducing the risk of wildfires through hazardous fuels management and mitigation investments. The administration is also proposing investments in wildfire protection and forest management in the FY 2022 budget.
