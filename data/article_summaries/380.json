President Biden's Investing in America agenda and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law have led to nearly $400 billion in funding and over 40,000 projects across 4,500 communities in the United States. These investments aim to rebuild infrastructure, improve access to clean water and high-speed internet, and promote clean energy. The administration's focus is on unlocking economic opportunities, creating jobs, and boosting domestic manufacturing. The White House has released state-specific fact sheets and an updated map to showcase the projects and awards underway. Implementation of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a key part of President Biden's agenda, which has already driven over $614 billion in private sector manufacturing and clean energy investments. The administration has taken nearly 400 trips across the country to highlight these investments. The progress spans various sectors, and the President is committed to ensuring that no community is left behind in the infrastructure rebuilding efforts.
