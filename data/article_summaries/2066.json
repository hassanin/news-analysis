President Biden is sending a proposal to Congress that aims to enhance the US government's authority to hold the Russian government and Russian oligarchs accountable for President Putin's war against Ukraine. The proposal includes several measures to streamline the process for seizure of oligarch assets, expand the assets subject to seizure, and enable the proceeds to flow to Ukraine. It also seeks to improve the US's ability to use forfeited oligarch funds to remediate harms caused to Ukraine by Russian aggression. Additionally, the proposal includes measures to clamp down on the facilitation of sanctions evasion, strengthen investigations and prosecutions of sanctions evasion, extend the statute of limitations for money laundering prosecutions, and improve the US's ability to work with international partners to recover assets linked to foreign corruption. The Biden Administration looks forward to working with Congress to implement these proposals.
