Vice President Joe Biden is scheduled to travel to Ukraine to meet with President Poroshenko and Prime Minister Yatsenyuk. The purpose of the trip is to provide a strong signal of support for Ukraine in the face of Russia's military intervention and to discuss economic, governance, and rule of law reforms. Biden will also emphasize the need to implement anti-corruption reforms and the importance of Ukraine's security. The Vice President will give a speech to the Ukrainian legislature, which is seen as a historic opportunity to lay out the US policy on Ukraine. The trip is not related to the situation in Syria and there are no plans to announce any new US commitments. The issue of Ukraine's debt to Russia is a bilateral matter and no concrete proposals have been received from Russia at this time.
