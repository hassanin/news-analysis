The article discusses the recent attacks on women's reproductive rights in the United States. It highlights the extreme abortion bans imposed by states, which not only jeopardize women's health but also potentially criminalize doctors providing necessary healthcare. The Supreme Court has agreed to review the Fifth Circuit's decision on mifepristone, a medication used for abortion, which could impose restrictions on access. The Biden administration supports the FDA's independent approval and regulation of mifepristone and is committed to defending women's access to reproductive care. They urge Congress to pass a law to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade, ensuring the right to choose for women in every state.
