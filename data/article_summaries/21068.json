In this letter, President Barack Obama is transmitting an alternative plan for locality pay increases for civilian Federal employees. The plan involves a 2.4 percent across-the-board adjustment in scheduled rates of basic pay and locality pay adjustments averaging 16.5 percent. However, the President determines that it is inappropriate to implement these pay increases due to the national emergency and serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare. He believes that it would not be acceptable for Federal employees to receive an average pay increase of 18.9 percent while many Americans are facing unemployment. Therefore, he decides to set alternative locality pay rates and states that this decision will not significantly impact the Government's ability to recruit and retain qualified employees.
