In this article, President Barack Obama discusses the benefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement. He emphasizes that the agreement will level the playing field for American workers and businesses, allowing them to export more products and support higher-paying jobs. Obama acknowledges that previous trade agreements have not always met expectations, but he believes that the TPP is a good deal with stronger commitments to labor and environmental standards. He invites everyone to read the agreement, which will be available online before he signs it, and expresses his willingness to work with lawmakers from both parties to consider and approve the agreement. Obama highlights the importance of trade in supporting the US economy and notes that outdated trade rules create disadvantages for American workers. He explains that the TPP will change this by setting higher standards for associated countries and eliminating thousands of taxes and trade barriers on US goods and services. Obama argues that without this agreement, countries like China will continue to write the rules of the global economy, selling in US markets while keeping their markets closed to American businesses. He believes that the TPP will establish the US as a leader in the 21st century and benefit American workers and businesses. Obama encourages people to read the agreement for themselves and states his intention to work with Congress to pass the agreement and grow the economy in the coming decades.
