The article discusses the new Dynamic Ventilator Reserve, a model created by the Trump Administration to ensure that ventilators are available to patients everywhere during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) projects that the existing national supply of ventilators is sufficient to handle total national demand, even under aggressive virus spread scenarios. The Dynamic Ventilator Reserve aims to reallocate ventilators from areas with excess supply to areas that may face shortages. Hospitals participating in the reserve use an online platform to post their excess supply and send ventilators to other hospitals in need. The reserve reduces the burden on the Federal Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) and provides insurance against shortages for participating hospitals. The article suggests that this model can be applied to other critical supplies needed to combat COVID-19, ensuring that necessary healthcare equipment reaches areas in need through public-private partnerships.
