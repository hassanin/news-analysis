President Donald Trump has issued a Presidential Memorandum stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13566 with respect to Libya will continue beyond February 25, 2018. The memorandum explains that the extreme measures taken by Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his government, and close associates against the people of Libya pose a serious risk to national security. There is concern that former members of the Qadhafi government, members of the Qadhafi family, and their associates may misappropriate Libyan state assets, which could prolong and deepen the instability in Libya. This instability would benefit terrorist groups like the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and pose a threat to the United States and regional partners. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of a strong and united Libya in combating terrorism and highlights the ongoing political divisions in the country. It calls for political dialogue, accountability for those who obstruct Libya's democratic transition, and the continuation of appropriate sanctions. President Trump determines that the situation in Libya continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to national security and foreign policy, necessitating the continuation of the national emergency.
