This article is a presidential order issued by President Barack Obama regarding the proposed acquisition of a controlling interest in Aixtron SE by Grand Chip Investment GMBH. The order states that there is credible evidence suggesting that the acquisition may pose a threat to the national security of the United States. As a result, the order prohibits the acquisition and any similar transactions. The order also requires the Purchasers and Aixtron to take necessary steps to abandon the proposed acquisition within 30 days, unless an extension is granted by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The order further mandates that the Purchasers and Aixtron provide weekly certifications of compliance and efforts to abandon the acquisition until termination is completed. Any attempts to avoid or circumvent the order are prohibited, and the Attorney General is authorized to enforce it. The President reserves the right to issue further orders if deemed necessary to protect national security. The order will be published in the Federal Register, and a copy will be transmitted to the appropriate parties.
