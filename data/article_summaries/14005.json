President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Michigan due to severe storms and flooding that occurred in August 2014. This declaration allows federal funding to be provided to individuals, as well as state, tribal, and local governments, to aid in recovery efforts. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for property losses, and other programs to help individuals and businesses recover. The counties of Macomb, Oakland, and Wayne are eligible for this federal funding. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has named Dolph A. Diemont as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance through the DisasterAssistance.gov website or by calling FEMA.
