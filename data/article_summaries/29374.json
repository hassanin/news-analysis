This Presidential Memorandum, issued on October 25, 2017, establishes the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration Pilot Program. The program aims to promote the safe operation of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and enable the development of UAS technologies for various sectors including agriculture, commerce, emergency management, and human transportation. The program seeks to test and evaluate different models of government involvement in the development and enforcement of federal regulations for UAS operations, encourage UAS owners and operators to test new concepts of operations, and inform the development of future federal guidelines and regulatory decisions on UAS operations nationwide. The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), is tasked with establishing the program and soliciting proposals from state, local, and tribal governments to test UAS integration into the national airspace system. The program will operate for a period of three years, and the Secretary will submit annual reports on its progress.
