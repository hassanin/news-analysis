The article discusses the United States' support for peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland. The United States has been committed to assisting the people and leaders of Northern Ireland in building a strong society, vibrant economy, and enduring peace. This support dates back to before the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, with President Carter offering financial assistance in the event of an agreement. President Reagan also reiterated this promise and established the International Fund for Ireland (IFI) in 1986 to support economic and social development in the affected areas. The United States continues to work with the people and institutions of Northern Ireland to implement the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement. The United States has also collaborated with Northern Ireland to promote conflict resolution and reconciliation through programs like the IFI-funded Community Leadership Program. Educational and cultural exchanges, such as the Fulbright Program, have allowed students and scholars from both the United States and Northern Ireland to learn from each other. Economic cooperation has also been a focus, with the United States being an important economic partner for Northern Ireland, contributing to foreign direct investment and job creation. The U.S.-Ireland Research and Development Partnership promotes scientific research and economic development in priority areas. The United States has also emphasized the role of women in society, particularly in promoting peace and security. Programs like the Northern Ireland Vital Voices Initiative and IFI-funded activities aim to empower women and promote their involvement in the peace process.
