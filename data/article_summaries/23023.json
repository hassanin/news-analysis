On January 28, 2016, the President signed three bills into law. 

The first bill, S. 142, also known as the "Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act of 2015," requires that the packaging of liquid nicotine containers adhere to existing child poisoning prevention packaging standards. This is aimed at reducing the risk of children accidentally ingesting liquid nicotine.

The second bill, S. 1115, known as the "Grants Oversight and New Efficiency Act" or the GONE Act, provides Congress with additional information regarding the status of outstanding grant awards by Federal Agencies. This is intended to improve oversight and efficiency in the grant award process.

The third bill, S. 1629, titled the "District of Columbia Courts, Public Defender Service, and Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency Act of 2015," amends certain authorities of the District of Columbia Courts, the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, and the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia. The specifics of these amendments are not provided in the summary.
