President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Missouri due to severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred from May 8-16, 2009. This declaration allows for federal funding to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the disaster. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding. Thomas A. Hall has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made if requested by the state and further damage assessments warrant it. For more information, contact FEMA at (202) 646-4600.
