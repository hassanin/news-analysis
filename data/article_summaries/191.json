In her speech at the American Association of Community Colleges' National Legislative Summit, First Lady Dr. Jill Biden expressed her gratitude to the advocates for community colleges, particularly the students who made the effort to attend the event. She emphasized that governing is not a game and that there are no teams or winners and losers, but rather a collective effort to help all Americans. Dr. Biden mentioned the progress made in supporting community colleges through the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, but also acknowledged the compromises that had to be made. She expressed disappointment that free community college was no longer part of the Build Back Better agenda, but highlighted the importance of community colleges in transforming towns and providing opportunities for students. Dr. Biden emphasized the challenges students face, such as affordable childcare and reliable transportation, and the need for affordable childcare and universal preschool to improve people's lives. She encouraged the audience to share their stories and advocate for the resources and support community colleges need. Dr. Biden concluded by affirming President Joe Biden's commitment to rebuilding the middle class and supporting community colleges. She assured the audience that they have the support of the President and herself in their efforts to bring about the change and progress that students deserve.
