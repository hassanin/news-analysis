A new poll conducted by the New York Times and SurveyMonkey shows that a majority of Americans now approve of the tax law signed by President Trump in December. This is likely due to the fact that over 400 companies have announced worker bonuses, raises, or 401(k) boosts as a result of the tax cuts. Examples include Walmart raising its minimum wage to $11 an hour and issuing bonuses of up to $1,000, Fiat Chrysler issuing $2,000 bonuses, and Southwest Airlines donating $5 million to charity on top of $1,000 bonuses for its workers. The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that the impact of tax reform could be more than $4,000 annually for the average American family. Other surveys indicate that tax cuts are driving optimism throughout the economy. Some Democrats, including Rep. Keith Ellison and Rep. John Yarmuth, have broken rank with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and acknowledged the positive effects of the tax cuts. As the results from tax reform continue to pour in, more Democratic legislators may acknowledge the importance of tax relief for working- and middle-class constituents.
