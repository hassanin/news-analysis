The Trump Administration supports the use of prizes and challenges by federal agencies to address important issues and foster innovation. These competitions have a track record of promoting innovation, solving complex problems, creating jobs, saving money, and improving the quality of life for Americans. The Department of Energy has announced a Critical Water Issues Prize Competition to gather input from the public on water-related challenges. Prizes and challenges can disrupt traditional thinking, introduce new possibilities, and allow federal agencies to engage the public in finding innovative solutions. The General Services Administration operates Challenge.gov, a platform that allows the public to contribute their knowledge and expertise to solve complex problems. The Trump Administration looks forward to further collaboration with federal agencies and the private sector to use prizes and challenges to improve the lives of Americans.
