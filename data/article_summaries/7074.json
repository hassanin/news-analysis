This week, a delegation of U.S. government officials, led by National Security Council Indo-Pacific Coordinator Kurt Campbell and Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink, will visit Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. The delegation, which includes representatives from various government agencies, aims to strengthen ties with the Pacific Island nations and promote a free, open, and resilient Indo-Pacific. In Hawaii, they will consult with military officials and regional partners at the United States Indo-Pacific Command. In the three Pacific Island nations, the delegation will meet with senior government officials to ensure partnerships that bring prosperity, security, and peace to the region. They will also hold discussions with the Pacific Islands Forum, an important regional organization, to address issues concerning the Pacific as a whole. This trip follows Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to the region in February, during which the Indo-Pacific Strategy of the United States was released, emphasizing the shared commitment to democracy and prosperity in the Pacific.
