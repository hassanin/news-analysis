The White House has released a draft National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (NSTIC) for public comment and input. The strategy aims to address the increasing issues of identity theft, online fraud, and cyber intrusions by improving online identity management. The development process involved input from industry advisory councils and associations, with nearly 4000 comments collected and adjudicated. The strategy focuses on improving identification and authentication in online transactions, ranging from accessing electronic health records to online banking. It proposes the creation of an Identity Ecosystem where individuals and organizations can complete online transactions with confidence. The strategy includes four goals: designing the Identity Ecosystem, building the infrastructure, strengthening privacy protections, and managing the ecosystem. The document is open for public review and input until July 19th.
