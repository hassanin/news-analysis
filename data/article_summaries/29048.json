President Trump signed an executive order aimed at providing Obamacare relief and increasing healthcare options for Americans. The order directs the Department of Health and Human Services, the Treasury, and the Department of Labor to take action to increase competition, choice, and access to lower-priced, high-quality healthcare options. The order also encourages the formation of associations for small businesses to buy affordable health insurance, as well as the expansion of these associations and healthcare plans across state lines. Additionally, the order explores the expansion of short-term limited duration insurance and the use of tax-free health reimbursement arrangements to compensate employees for healthcare expenses. The President emphasized that these actions are just the beginning and that more measures will be taken in the coming months to provide relief and freedom in the healthcare market.
