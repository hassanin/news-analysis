President Biden has launched a global coalition to combat the threat of synthetic drugs, such as fentanyl. The coalition includes more than 70 countries and international organizations, and aims to prevent drug manufacturing, identify emerging threats, interdict drug trafficking, and reduce both the supply and demand for deadly drugs. The coalition builds on strong collaboration with Mexico and Canada to address the fentanyl challenge in North America. This initiative represents a significant step forward in tackling the opioid crisis and protecting people from the dangers of synthetic drugs.
