On December 16, 2021, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 5142, awards a Congressional Gold Medal to honor the servicemembers who died in Afghanistan on August 26, 2021, during the evacuation of US citizens and Afghan allies at Hamid Karzai International Airport. The second bill, S.J. Res. 33, grants the authority to increase the debt limit by $2.5 trillion. The President expressed gratitude to Representative McClain and Senators Daines and Warren, as well as others, for their leadership in passing these bills.
