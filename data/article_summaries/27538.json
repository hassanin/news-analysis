President Trump and his administration have made efforts to fulfill the promise of keeping communities safe. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) recently announced the arrests of almost 200 individuals in Southern California, targeting criminal aliens, illegal re-entrants, and immigration fugitives. About 90% of those arrested had prior criminal convictions, including offenses such as domestic violence, battery, sex crimes, manslaughter, assault, arson, and cruelty to a child. In the 100 days since Trump signed executive orders on immigration enforcement, ICE has arrested around 30,000 convicted criminal aliens, with offenses ranging from homicide and assault to sexual abuse and drug-related activity. ICE has also conducted a nationwide gang apprehension operation resulting in the arrest of 384 illegal immigrants, including those charged with homicide or sexual crimes. One specific case mentioned is that of a Guatemalan man who was sentenced to 50 years in federal prison for producing child pornography. These actions are part of the administration's efforts to enhance national security and protect communities.
