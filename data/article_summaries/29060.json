In this article, it is stated that during the historic meeting between President Donald J. Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un in Singapore, they took a step towards achieving the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and establishing peace. The Chairman is now fulfilling his commitment to the President by returning fallen American service members. The remains are being transported from North Korea to Osan Air Base, where a repatriation ceremony will be held on August 1. This action is seen as a significant first step towards resuming the repatriation of remains from North Korea and continuing the search for the estimated 5,300 Americans who have yet to be returned home.
