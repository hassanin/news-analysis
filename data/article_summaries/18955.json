Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, Lisa Monaco, met with Libyan Prime Minister Fayiz al-Sarraj to discuss U.S.-Libyan counterterrorism cooperation and other efforts by the Government of National Accord (GNA) on behalf of the Libyan people. They reviewed the progress of GNA forces in regaining control of Sirte from ISIL fighters and discussed plans to stabilize the city after ISIL is cleared out. Monaco also congratulated Sarraj on the recent removal of chemical weapons precursors from Libya, with international support, to prevent them from falling into the hands of ISIL or other terrorist groups. They emphasized the importance of the GNA proposing a new cabinet and the House of Representatives endorsing it without delay.
