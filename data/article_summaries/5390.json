The Biden administration has released a blueprint for a fair, orderly, and humane immigration system. The blueprint includes four strategies: 1) a humane and well-managed border, 2) orderly and fair processing of asylum seekers, 3) collaborative migration management with regional partners, and 4) addressing the root causes of migration. The administration is working on implementing expedited removal for families who do not express fear of returning to their home country, allowing asylum officers to adjudicate asylum claims, and creating a dedicated asylum docket. The administration is also focused on addressing the root causes of migration by providing humanitarian relief, engaging with international partners, and encouraging private sector investment in the region. The strategy aims to provide legal pathways for migration and improve border management in a humane and secure manner. The administration is also working to address corruption, strengthen democratic governance, promote human rights, combat violence and crimes, and support economic growth and equality in the region. The strategy is a comprehensive and integrated approach to address the challenges of migration.
