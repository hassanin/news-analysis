President Biden delivered remarks and signed an executive order titled "Ensuring the Future Is Made in America, by Americans - All of American Workers." The executive order aims to rebuild the backbone of America, which includes manufacturing, unions, and the middle class. The order strengthens Buy American policies by requiring federal agencies to explain any waivers to the Buy American requirement and making sure waivers are only used in limited circumstances. It also directs the Office of Management and Budget to review waivers and improve the measurement of domestic content requirements. Additionally, the order emphasizes the importance of investing in American workers, businesses, and infrastructure, with a focus on clean energy, research and development, and the use of American-made products. President Biden also addressed the reopening of schools and the need for unity in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and economic recovery. He expressed confidence in the vaccine rollout and stated that he hopes to have enough vaccine supply to vaccinate a million people per day within the next three weeks. However, he acknowledged that it will take time to beat the virus and stressed the importance of wearing masks to save lives.
