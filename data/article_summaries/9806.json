In the United States, the government is promoting girls' education in STEM fields, funding strategies to reduce teen pregnancy, and encouraging girls to become leaders. President Obama calls upon all Americans to observe International Day of the Girl with programs and activities that advance equality and opportunity for girls worldwide.
