President Biden welcomed Prime Minister Morrison, Prime Minister Modi, and Prime Minister Suga to the White House for the first in-person meeting of the Quad. The Quad is a group of democratic partners who share a world view and have a common vision for the future. They are coming together to address key challenges such as COVID, climate change, and emerging technologies. Progress has been made in their vaccine initiative, with an additional 1 billion doses of vaccine to be produced in India to boost global supply. The Quad is also taking action on climate change, launching a new partnership for zero-emissions shipping. Additionally, a new Quad fellowship is being launched for students from each country to pursue advanced degrees in STEM programs in the United States. The leaders emphasized their commitment to cooperation, democracy, and addressing global challenges.
