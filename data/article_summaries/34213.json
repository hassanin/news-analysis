President Donald Trump has notified Congress of his intent to suspend duty-free treatment for certain eligible articles imported from Thailand under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. This decision is based on the determination that Thailand is not adequately protecting internationally recognized worker rights. The suspension will take effect six months from the date of the proclamation. President Trump emphasizes that the United States is still committed to fair and reciprocal trade with Thailand.
