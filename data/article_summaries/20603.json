President Obama announced his intent to recess appoint fifteen nominees to fill critical administration posts that have been left vacant, including key positions on the economic team and on boards that have been left with vacancies for months. These nominees have been pending for an average of 214 days or 7 months. The President stated that if the Senate refuses to approve or disapprove his nominees, he must act in the interest of the American people and fill these positions on an interim basis. Following their appointment, these nominees will remain in the Senate for confirmation.
