President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation recognizing May 2019 as National Mental Health Awareness Month. In the proclamation, the President acknowledges the vital role mental health plays in the well-being of individuals and the nation as a whole. The administration is committed to facilitating research and education, dispelling stigma around mental illnesses, and reassuring those suffering from mental illnesses that they are not alone. The focus of the administration's public health efforts is on mental and behavioral health, particularly opioid addiction and serious mental illness. The proclamation also highlights the prevalence of mental illnesses in the United States, with nearly 47 million American adults living with a mental illness. It also mentions the increase in rates of major depression, suicidal thoughts and attempts, and serious mental illness among youth and young adults. The administration is working to improve mental health by expanding partnerships with states, maintaining funding for community mental health services, and expanding access to treatment options. Efforts are also being made to meet the mental health needs of service members and veterans, with the establishment of the President's Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide (PREVENTS) Initiative. The proclamation concludes by urging all Americans to support citizens suffering from mental illnesses, raise awareness, and commit to innovative prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.
