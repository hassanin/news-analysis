The Biden Administration has announced a plan to ensure that if the COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for children ages 5-11, it will be quickly distributed and made easily accessible to families across the United States. The plan relies heavily on states, tribes, and territories to help implement the rollout. The Administration has secured enough vaccine supply to support vaccination for the country's 28 million children in this age group. Vaccination sites will be set up in familiar settings such as doctors' offices, hospitals, pharmacies, community health centers, and school- and community-based sites. A national public education campaign will be conducted to provide accurate information and build public trust. The campaign will work with trusted messengers, schools, health departments, faith leaders, and national and community organizations to increase vaccine confidence. The COVID-19 Community Corps and pediatricians will play a critical role in mobilizing grassroots efforts. The Surgeon General will enlist pediatricians and community leaders to directly address questions and concerns through popular media and social media channels.
