The Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities, led by National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, convened to discuss the Administration's efforts to support economic revitalization in energy communities. They highlighted recent official travel to energy communities and the engagement of thousands of stakeholders in listening sessions. Funding announcements from various agencies, such as the Department of Commerce, the Department of Agriculture, and the Appalachian Regional Commission, were also discussed. Additionally, the group emphasized how President Biden's Build Back Better Agenda and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will deliver clean energy and manufacturing investments to spur economic revitalization in coal and power plant communities. The investments will also focus on environmental remediation to create union jobs in these communities.
