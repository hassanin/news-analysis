The U.S. and UK have a strong and longstanding partnership in counterterrorism cooperation. They have worked together to disrupt and prevent numerous terrorist attacks, including plots on U.S. and UK soil. The two countries have collaborated on combat operations, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan, and have also worked together to ensure the safety and security of major events, such as the Olympic Games in London. They have also joined forces to protect global transit systems, defend against cyber attacks, and interdict weapons smuggling. Law enforcement and intelligence cooperation have led to the arrest and conviction of many terrorist operatives and supporters. The U.S. and UK share a common understanding of the conditions that terrorists exploit to secure safe-havens and work together to counter extremist ideology and promote stability and security through foreign assistance programs. In addition to counterterrorism efforts, the two countries are also deepening cooperation against transnational organized crime.
