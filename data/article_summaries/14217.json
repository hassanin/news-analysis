President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Washington due to flooding and mudslides that occurred in March 2014. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected area. The assistance includes grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the disaster. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will work closely with affected residents, tribal members, and business owners to provide assistance. Michael J. Hall has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
