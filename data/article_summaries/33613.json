Intel CEO, Brian Krzanich, announced a $7 billion investment in their newest factory, Fab 42, in Chandler, Arizona. The factory will produce the most advanced 7-nanometer semiconductor chips and create approximately 3,000 direct high-paying, high-tech jobs at its peak, as well as over 10,000 jobs in support of the factory. Krzanich highlighted that the majority of Intel's manufacturing and research and development is done in the U.S., even though most of their sales are outside of the country. He also credited the favorable tax and regulatory policies under the Trump administration for their decision to invest in the U.S.
