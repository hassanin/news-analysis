President Biden has declared a major disaster in the state of Alabama due to severe storms and flooding that occurred in October. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. Federal funding will be available for individuals in Jefferson and Shelby counties, and can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Hazard mitigation measures will also be eligible for federal funding on a cost-sharing basis statewide. James R. Stephenson has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are still ongoing in other areas, and additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated as assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The FEMA News Desk can be contacted for further information.
