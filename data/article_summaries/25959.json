President Trump commends the House Ways and Means Committee for introducing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, stating that it is an important step towards providing significant tax relief for the American people. The President's tax reform priorities include tax cuts for middle-income Americans, eliminating unfair loopholes and deductions, and reducing business taxes to stimulate job creation and promote global competitiveness. The President believes that his Administration's policies have already had a positive impact on the stock market, unemployment rate, and economic confidence. He emphasizes that there is still more work to be done and acknowledges that special interests, lobbyists, and some in the media may distort the facts or criticize their efforts. Nevertheless, the Administration remains committed to delivering historic tax cuts and reforms to benefit the working people and propel the economy to new heights.
