President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the state of West Virginia in response to severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides that occurred between April 8-11, 2015. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. Federal funding will be available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, facility repairs or replacements, and hazard mitigation measures. The designated counties include Braxton, Brooke, Doddridge, Gilmer, Jackson, Lewis, Marshall, Ohio, Pleasants, Ritchie, Tyler, and Wetzel. Kari Suzann Cowie has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and further damage assessments warrant it.
