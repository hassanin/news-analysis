The President has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, providing a supplemental report on military operations in support of U.S. counterterrorism objectives. Since 2001, the U.S. has conducted combat operations in Afghanistan against al Qa'ida and the Taliban, with ongoing deployments in various areas. The U.S. has successfully degraded al Qa'ida's capabilities and ended the Taliban's leadership in Afghanistan. There are currently about 87,000 U.S. forces in Afghanistan, with more than 62,000 assigned to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The U.S. also continues to detain several hundred al Qa'ida and Taliban fighters at Guantanamo Bay. In addition, the U.S. has deployed combat forces to assist in enhancing the counterterrorism capabilities of allies around the world. The U.S. is committed to preventing future acts of international terrorism and will take additional measures to protect its citizens and interests. In Iraq, U.S. forces have continued operations to support Iraq in maintaining security and stability since the expiration of the Multinational Force's authorization in 2008. The U.S. contribution to the Iraq mission currently stands at about 95,000 military personnel. The U.S. also conducts maritime interception operations to stop the movement, arming, and financing of certain international terrorist groups. In Kosovo, the U.S. contributes about 1,074 military personnel to the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR), which helps maintain a safe and secure environment. The President has directed the participation of U.S. Armed Forces in all these operations based on his constitutional and statutory authority. Regular communication with Congress on these deployments will continue.
