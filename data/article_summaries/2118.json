President Biden gave a speech addressing the issue of inflation and presented two potential paths forward to address the challenge. He highlighted the progress made in the economy and job creation, but acknowledged that families are still hurting due to inflation. He identified two leading causes of inflation: the once-in-a-century pandemic and Putin's war in Ukraine. He discussed the actions taken to address these causes, including releasing oil reserves and working with European partners to get food supplies out of Ukraine. He emphasized the importance of the Federal Reserve in fighting inflation and urged the Senate to confirm his nominees for the institution. 

President Biden compared his plan to the Republican plan in tackling inflation. His plan focuses on lowering everyday costs for families, asking large corporations and the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share in taxes. He mentioned specific proposals, such as allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and promoting competition in various industries. He also highlighted the deficit reduction achieved under his administration. In contrast, he criticized the Republican plan for raising taxes on middle-class families, protecting big corporations, and threatening programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. He urged Americans to consider the two paths and emphasized the importance of focusing on what families need. The President also addressed questions about high gas prices, asking Americans to consume less, and the possibility of dropping tariffs on China. He declined to comment on restrictions on abortion and responded to Senator Rick Scott's criticism by saying that the senator has a problem.
