The White House and the Department of Defense have announced that 100 megahertz of mid-band spectrum will be made available for commercial 5G deployment across the United States. This move is aimed at improving speeds, reliability, and latency for 5G networks, which will benefit every industry and the lives of Americans. President Trump is committed to strengthening US leadership in 5G communications for the security and prosperity of the American people. The availability of more mid-band spectrum is crucial for driving widespread 5G access, particularly in rural areas. The Trump Administration has ensured that commercial use of this spectrum will not compromise military preparedness or national security. 5G networks are expected to be 100 times faster than current 4G networks and will bring transformative changes to various sectors such as education, healthcare, manufacturing, and agriculture.
