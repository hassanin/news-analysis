President Biden addressed the recent incident involving unidentified aerial objects (UFOs) in US airspace. He stated that three unidentified objects were tracked, one in Alaska, one in Canada, and one over Lake Huron in the Midwest. The decision was made to take down these objects due to potential hazards to civilian air traffic and the surveillance risk to sensitive facilities. The President clarified that there is currently no evidence linking these objects to China's spy balloon program or any other country's surveillance vehicles. The intelligence community's assessment is that these objects were likely balloons associated with private companies, recreation, or research institutions conducting scientific studies. President Biden emphasized that if any object poses a threat to the safety and security of the American people, it will be taken down. He also announced his plans to establish clearer rules for dealing with unidentified objects in the future, enhance detection capabilities, update regulations for launching and maintaining unmanned objects, and work towards establishing global norms in this area. The President acknowledged the importance of maintaining open lines of communication between diplomats and military professionals and expressed his commitment to competition, not conflict, with China. He concluded by thanking the intelligence, diplomatic, and military professionals involved and stated that he will keep allies and Congress informed of developments.
