The fifth meeting of the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform for Ukraine was held virtually on July 25th. The group, co-chaired by Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics Mike Pyle, Deputy Prime Minister for Restoration of Ukraine Oleksandr Kubrakov, and European Commission Director-General for Neighborhood and Enlargement Negotiations Gert Jan Koopman, discussed aligning donor and international financial institution (IFI) assistance with Ukraine's priority needs. The group acknowledged the progress made so far but recognized the need for further coordination. Donors pledged to continue matching available financing to identified gaps and coordinating support for Ukraine's reform agenda. DNSA Pyle emphasized the role of the Platform in engaging donors and IFIs in Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction priorities, calling for intensified efforts to prioritize and sequence support for investment and reform plans. Collaboration within the Platform will continue, with the next Steering Committee meeting scheduled for September.
