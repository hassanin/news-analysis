The Department of Health and Human Services has released the United States Health Security National Action Plan (the Plan), which aims to help the government prepare for and respond to public health emergencies. The Plan builds on the guidance of the National Security Strategy and the National Biodefense Strategy and outlines the actions the government will take to increase domestic preparedness. It was developed in response to gaps identified through the United States Joint External Evaluation in 2016. The Plan involves collaboration across more than 13 departments and agencies to protect America's health security. The Trump Administration is also taking additional measures to protect the American people from biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear hazards.
