President Biden held a press conference in the East Room of the White House to announce a bipartisan agreement on infrastructure. The agreement was reached between five Democrats and five Republicans and aims to create millions of jobs and modernize American infrastructure. The President thanked the senators involved in the negotiations and emphasized the importance of working together as a nation. The agreement includes investments in repairing roads and bridges, expanding access to high-speed internet, replacing lead water pipes, upgrading the power grid, investing in public transit and rail, and installing electric vehicle charging stations. The President also highlighted the need for a fairer tax system to pay for these investments. He expressed his intention to work with Congress to pass both the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the American Family Plan, which focuses on childcare, education, clean energy, and tax cuts for families. The President acknowledged that there are disagreements within his party but expressed confidence in finding common ground and getting both bills passed. He also addressed the issue of voting rights and emphasized the importance of protecting the sacred right to vote. The President stated that he will be making the case to the American people and campaigning for support for these bills. He concluded the press conference by discussing his administration's response to the collapse of a building in South Beach, Miami, and expressing his commitment to providing assistance to those affected.
