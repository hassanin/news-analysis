The article discusses how the media missed a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy during President Trump's recent trip to the Middle East. The author argues that while the media focused on trivial matters, they failed to recognize that Trump was rallying the Muslim world to combat terrorism and extremism. The author compares this moment to President Reagan's call to defend freedom against communist aggression in 1982, stating that Trump's approach is unprecedented in terms of uniting the civilized world against terrorism and placing the responsibility on the nations of the region. The author praises Trump for backing up his words with action and emphasizes that this shift in foreign policy is impressive given that it occurred within the first four months of his administration.
