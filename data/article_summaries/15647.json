The article discusses the continuation of the national emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia. The President, in accordance with the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, declared a national emergency on October 21, 1995, due to the threat posed by these traffickers to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States. The extreme level of violence, corruption, and harm caused by these actions in the United States and abroad necessitates the continuation of the national emergency. The President has therefore decided to extend the emergency for one year, as mandated by the National Emergencies Act. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
