The Biden-Harris administration is preparing for the state visit of President Macron and the delegation from France. This visit is seen as an opportunity to highlight the administration's approach to strengthening alliances and France's role as a critical partner in addressing global challenges. The visit will focus on coordinating on urgent global issues, such as Ukraine, China, Iran, and the Middle East. The economic partnership between the U.S. and France will also be discussed, with a focus on energy cooperation and clean energy investments. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will be a topic of conversation, with the U.S. emphasizing the opportunities it presents for European firms and the clean energy transition. COVID protocols will be in place for the state dinner and the visit in general. The decision to invite France for a state visit was based on the long-standing relationship and partnership between the two countries, as well as France's role as a key ally in various global initiatives. The U.S. and France share a common view on addressing the challenges posed by China, and this will be a topic of discussion during the visit.
