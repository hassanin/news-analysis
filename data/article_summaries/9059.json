The Biden-Harris Administration is taking several actions to address the mental health crisis in the United States. These actions include increasing funding to expand access to mental health services, strengthening the mental health workforce, and creating a continuum of support. The Department of Education has awarded over $280 million to bolster the pipeline of mental health professionals serving in schools and expand school-based mental health services. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) will release National Model Standards for Peer Support Certification to improve consistency across peer certifications. SAMHSA is also providing over $200 million for states, territories, call centers, and Tribal organizations to strengthen crisis response services. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is awarding state planning grants to help develop Certified Community Behavioral Health Centers (CCBHCs) that provide comprehensive behavioral health care. The administration is also working to connect more Americans to care by launching FindSupport.Gov, a resource for mental health, drug, and alcohol support. Additionally, they are providing mental health services in schools, supporting the mental health of workers, reducing stigma for service members and veterans, delivering mental health services to caregivers, and reducing disparities in maternal mental health. The administration is also taking actions to create healthy and supportive environments by improving youth resilience, promoting social connection, investing in early childhood mental health, improving suicide prevention efforts, and supporting mental health research. They are also focused on improving employee wellness and expanding access to recovery support for people with substance use disorders.
