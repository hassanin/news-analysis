During a teleconference, senior administration officials announced that all seven Americans who were wrongfully detained in Venezuela are on their way home to the United States. This includes the remaining five executives of the Citgo Six, Marine Corps Veteran Matthew Heath, and Osman Khan. The release of these Americans is the result of extensive negotiations and efforts by the U.S. government. The President personally spoke with each of the released Americans' families to share the good news. The officials emphasized that the safe return of these Americans is a priority for the Biden administration. The President made the tough decision to grant clemency to two Venezuelans, Efrain Antonio Campo Flores and Francisco Flores de Freitas, in exchange for the release of the Americans. The officials did not provide details about the logistics of the exchange or the current whereabouts of the Venezuelans. They also mentioned that there are other Americans still detained in Venezuela and around the world, and the administration remains dedicated to securing their release. The officials acknowledged that negotiations with the Venezuelans involved direct discussions between the United States and Venezuela, without the involvement of other countries. They did not provide specific details about the negotiation process or the involvement of the President. The officials did not provide updates on the cases of Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner, who are also detained in foreign countries. They emphasized that the decision to grant clemency to the two Venezuelans was a rare and painful choice made to bring home the wrongfully detained Americans. The officials did not provide detailed information about the health or mental state of the released Americans, stating that it is important to respect their privacy and allow them and their families to share their stories in the coming days.
