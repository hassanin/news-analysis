President Biden's Executive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad called for the preparation of a Climate Finance Plan, focusing on international climate finance. The plan aims to double the annual public climate finance to developing countries by 2024 and triple adaptation finance. U.S. agencies will prioritize climate in public investments, enhance technical assistance, align support with country needs, and boost investments in adaptation and resilience. Efforts will also be made to mobilize private finance, increase investments in climate-related projects, and end international investments in carbon-intensive fossil fuel-based energy. The plan also emphasizes making capital flows consistent with low-emissions and climate-resilient pathways and improving the tracking and reporting of U.S. international climate finance. The plan will be reviewed in 2023 to assess progress and make necessary changes.
