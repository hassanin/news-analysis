The United States strongly condemns Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif Khonsari for honoring Imad Mugniyah, a former leader of Lebanese Hezbollah responsible for acts of terrorism that killed many innocent people, including Americans. Mugniyah's violent actions, and the ongoing support for terrorism by Lebanese Hezbollah with Iran's backing, have caused significant destabilization and loss of life in Lebanon and the region. The decision to commemorate Mugniyah and support his organization sends the wrong message and will only worsen tensions in the region.
