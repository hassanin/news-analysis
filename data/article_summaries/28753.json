The article is a statement from President Donald Trump addressed to the Senate of the United States. The statement is regarding the Protocol Supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, also known as the Beijing Protocol. The Beijing Protocol, adopted in 2010, is an international effort to prevent and punish terrorism targeting civil aviation. It amends the existing hijacking offense in the Hague Convention to cover hijackings that occur pre- or post-flight and includes provisions for situations where the offender may attempt to control an aircraft remotely. The protocol requires states to criminalize these acts under their domestic laws and cooperate in preventing and investigating suspected crimes. The United States will need to make changes to its laws to implement the provisions of the Beijing Protocol, and proposed legislation is being transmitted separately to Congress. President Trump recommends that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the Beijing Protocol, subject to certain reservations and understandings described in the accompanying report from the Department of State.
