On February 10, 2021, President Joseph R. Biden issued an Executive Order declaring a national emergency with respect to the situation in Burma (also known as Myanmar) following the military coup on February 1, 2021. The order targets the military and its leaders, their business interests, and their close family members in response to their actions, including the unjust arrest and detention of government leaders, politicians, human rights defenders, journalists, and religious leaders. The order authorizes the blocking of property and interests in property of foreign individuals determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State. It also suspends entry into the United States of noncitizens who meet certain criteria. The President has delegated the authority to the Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of State, and Secretary of Homeland Security to implement and carry out the provisions of the order.
