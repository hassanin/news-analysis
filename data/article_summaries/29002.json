The article discusses the potential negative impact of H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act of 2019, on medical innovation and patient access to new drugs. The bill aims to lower prices for select drugs by forcing drug manufacturers to accept prices set by the Secretary of Health and Human Services or face a high excise tax. The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that H.R. 3 could lead to as many as 100 fewer drugs entering the US market over the next decade, reducing Americans' average life expectancy by about four months. The economic value of this loss of new drugs and worse health outcomes could reach $1 trillion per year. The Congressional Budget Office also acknowledges the potential harmful effects on drug innovation, suggesting that 8 to 15 fewer drugs may come to market over the next decade. The article argues that the bill's cost-saving measures are not worth the long-term impact on patients losing access to new lifesaving treatments.
