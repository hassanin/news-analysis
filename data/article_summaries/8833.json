President Biden has authorized an increase in federal funding for disaster assistance in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. This funding is for emergency work related to severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides that occurred starting on July 26, 2022. Previously, federal funding was available at 75% of the total eligible costs for public assistance and hazard mitigation. However, under the new order, federal funds for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct federal assistance, will now be provided at 100% of the total eligible costs for a 30-day period. The Commonwealth of Kentucky can choose the specific 30-day period within the first 120 days of the declaration.
