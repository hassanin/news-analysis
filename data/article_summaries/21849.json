President Obama has announced new investments to enhance safety and security in the changing Arctic. The Arctic has been warming at twice the rate of the rest of the world, resulting in significant impacts on land and sea. The retreat of Arctic sea ice has led to an increase in marine traffic, including fishing, mineral exploration, cargo shipping, and tourism. To address the challenges posed by increased activity in the Arctic, President Obama plans to accelerate the acquisition of additional icebreakers to ensure year-round operations in the Arctic Ocean. The United States currently only has three icebreakers, while Russia has forty. The Obama Administration also plans to enhance scientific observations of the Arctic to increase understanding of the region. Efforts will be made to promote safe marine operations and transportation in the Arctic through mapping and charting efforts. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) will survey transit routes and use satellite data for shoreline mapping. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will evaluate the feasibility of deepening and extending harbors in the U.S. Arctic region. The Administration will consult with Alaska Native communities to ensure the protection of subsistence fishing, healthy ecosystems, and safety. Additionally, efforts will be made to monitor the effects of climate change and enable safe marine operations through the installation of additional instrumentation and the launch of a new Arctic sea-ice thickness satellite product. The Administration will also support projects on community-based ecological monitoring and celebrate the National Parks centennial by revitalizing national parks and connecting a new generation to the outdoors. The proposed legislation, the "National Park Service Centennial Act," aims to support the goals of the National Park Service and promote volunteerism and diversity.
