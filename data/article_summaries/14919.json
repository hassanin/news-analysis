The President has made a statement on the signing of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The TPP is a trade deal between 12 countries that aims to set new standards for trade and investment. The President believes that the current rules of global trade put American workers and businesses at a disadvantage, and the TPP will change that. It eliminates thousands of taxes on American products, promotes a free and open Internet, and includes enforceable labor and environmental standards. The President sees the TPP as an opportunity for America to write the rules of trade in the 21st century, rather than countries like China. He released the full text of the agreement three months ago and is working with Democrats and Republicans in Congress to pass it into law. The President believes that the TPP will bolster America's leadership abroad and create more jobs and economic opportunities at home.
