President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed Sunday, September 25, 2022, as Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day in the United States. This day is dedicated to honoring and supporting the families of American service members who have made the ultimate sacrifice in protecting the country's lives and liberties. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of remembering and recognizing the heroes who have been lost and supporting their loved ones as they navigate life without them. It also highlights the ongoing need to uphold the idea of freedom and democracy that the United States represents, especially in the face of global authoritarianism. The sacrifices made by military families, often unseen and unsung, are acknowledged, and their resilience and strength are commended. The proclamation emphasizes the duty to remember fallen warriors and stand by their surviving families. The Joining Forces initiative is mentioned as a way to provide support and resources to military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors. Gold Star families are recognized for their ability to offer solace to others in their own grief and are thanked for their service and sacrifice. The proclamation encourages government officials and the American people to display the flag and hold appropriate ceremonies to express gratitude and respect for Gold Star Mothers and Families.
