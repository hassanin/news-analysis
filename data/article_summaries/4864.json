American ports, which are crucial to the country's economy, are facing challenges due to outdated infrastructure and the COVID-19 pandemic. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) warns that ports need to modernize infrastructure and deal with climate challenges. Only four U.S. ports are among the top 50 busiest ports globally, and none are in the top 10. Many ports have limitations that prevent them from accommodating larger vessels. As a result, container traffic is concentrated in a smaller number of ports that can handle larger ships. The underfunding of port infrastructure has significant costs for the economy and global competitiveness.

To address these issues, President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal includes $17 billion to improve coastal ports, inland ports, waterways, and land ports of entry. This investment aims to strengthen supply chain resiliency, create jobs, and enhance America's competitiveness against China. The Biden-Harris Administration has also announced immediate actions to accelerate investment in ports, waterways, and freight networks. These actions include increasing federal flexibilities for port grants, expediting port infrastructure grant awards, announcing new construction projects, and launching expanded port infrastructure grants.

Additionally, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal includes $110 billion to repair roads and bridges and support transformative projects that improve supply chains and goods movement. The administration will also focus on data sharing among different actors in the supply chain to reduce delays and inefficiencies. Strengthening digital infrastructure is seen as crucial to enhancing supply chain resiliency and leveraging digitization.

Overall, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking concrete steps to invest in port infrastructure, improve supply chains, and enhance the country's economic competitiveness.
