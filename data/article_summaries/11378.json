President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Alabama due to severe storms, tornadoes, winds, and flooding that occurred starting from April 15, 2011. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. The funding will provide assistance to affected individuals in specific counties, including grants for temporary housing, home repairs, and low-cost loans for uninsured property losses. Federal funding is also available for debris removal, emergency protective measures, and hazard mitigation measures throughout the state. Joe M. Girot has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations. Damage surveys are ongoing, and additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated later. Residents and business owners in the affected counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week.
