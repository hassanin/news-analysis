President Donald Trump has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq will continue beyond May 22, 2018. The President believes that obstacles to the reconstruction of Iraq, as well as the restoration of peace and security in the country, continue to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, he has determined it is necessary to maintain the national emergency.
