On June 25, 2009, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan and Secretary of Energy Steven Chu spoke about clean energy initiatives and the President's commitment to sign comprehensive energy and climate legislation. Secretary Donovan addressed the HOPE VI Green Building and Energy Efficient Development Conference in Washington, encouraging innovation in developing energy-efficient, affordable housing. Secretary Chu attended the Edison Electric Institute Annual Convention in San Francisco to announce new Recovery Act funding for clean energy projects. The HOPE VI program revitalizes distressed public housing and creates energy-efficient, mixed-income communities. Secretary Chu announced over $154 million in funding for State Energy Programs in California, Missouri, New Hampshire, and North Carolina, which will go towards clean energy initiatives. The Department of Energy is also soliciting applications for $3.9 billion in grants to modernize the electric grid and increase the integration of renewable energy sources.
