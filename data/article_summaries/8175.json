The article states that the national emergency with respect to Ukraine, declared by Executive Order 13660 in 2014, will be continued for another year. The national emergency was declared due to the actions and policies of persons undermining democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine, threatening its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, as well as contributing to the misappropriation of its assets. Several executive orders have been issued since then, expanding the scope of the national emergency and addressing the Russian occupation of Crimea and the use of force in Ukraine. The article emphasizes that these actions and policies continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency will remain in effect beyond March 6, 2021.
