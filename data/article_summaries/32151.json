President Trump gave a speech at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) headquarters in Washington, D.C., where he signed an executive order to eliminate federal regulations and restrictions on the coal industry. He promised to bring back jobs in the coal industry and to end the "war on coal." The president also mentioned lifting the ban on federal leasing for coal production and lifting job-killing restrictions on the production of oil, natural gas, clean coal, and shale energy. He emphasized the importance of putting power back into the hands of the states and local communities. President Trump believes that these actions will create millions of American jobs and lead to prosperity in the country.
