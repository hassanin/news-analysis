The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, along with several institutions including the Allen Institute for AI, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Georgetown University, Microsoft, and the National Library of Medicine, has released the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). This dataset is a collection of over 29,000 scholarly articles about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and the Coronavirus group, with over 13,000 articles having full text. The goal is to provide a machine-readable resource for data and text mining to help answer scientific questions related to COVID-19. The dataset was created through collaboration and coordination between the institutions involved, using tools from Microsoft, pre-publication content from CZI, literature content from NLM, and machine-readable transformation by the Allen AI team. The CORD-19 resource is available on the Allen Institute's SemanticScholar.org website and will be continually updated with new research. Researchers are encouraged to develop text and data mining techniques and submit their tools and insights via the Kaggle platform. The call to action and key questions related to COVID-19 are available on Kaggle as well. The aim is to use artificial intelligence technologies to advance scientific research and find solutions to the novel Coronavirus.
