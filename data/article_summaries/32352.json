This executive order, issued on April 21, 2017, is titled "Identifying and Reducing Tax Regulatory Burdens." The order aims to simplify, make fair, efficient, and pro-growth the Federal tax system. It states that many tax regulations issued in recent years have increased tax burdens, hindered economic growth, and burdened American businesses. The order directs the Secretary of the Treasury to review all significant tax regulations issued by the Department of the Treasury since January 1, 2016, and identify those that impose an undue financial burden, add complexity to the tax laws, or exceed the authority of the Internal Revenue Service. An interim report with these findings must be completed within 60 days. The Secretary is then required to submit a report with recommendations to the President within 150 days, suggesting specific actions to mitigate the burden imposed by the identified regulations. The Secretary is also instructed to delay or suspend the effective date of such regulations, modify or rescind them as appropriate and consistent with the law, and publish a summary of the actions taken in response to the report. If all actions are not finalized within 180 days, an initial report must be published summarizing the progress. Additionally, the Secretary and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget are to review and reconsider the scope and implementation of the existing exemption for certain tax regulations from the review process set forth in Executive Order 12866. The order includes general provisions that state it does not impair the authority of executive departments or agencies or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The order is to be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations, and it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
