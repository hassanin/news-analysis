This week, Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall, General Stephen Townsend, and Chris Maier, high-ranking officials from the Biden Administration, traveled to Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, and Niger to advance the counterterrorism policy of the United States. The main focus of the trip was to address the evolving threat landscape, prioritize the most dangerous threats, empower local partners to counter terrorist threats, and work with regional and international allies to achieve broader security, governance, and development goals in the region. 

During their visit, the delegation recognized the contributions of the U.S. military personnel in each country, particularly those involved in the counterterrorism campaign against al-Shabaab in East Africa. They also met with U.S. Embassy officials to discuss the adaptation of the counterterrorism enterprise to detect emerging threats and coordinate with local partners and the African Union Mission in Somalia. In Djibouti, they met with Special Operations Forces responsible for crisis response capabilities on the African continent.

In West Africa, the delegation visited Niger, which serves as the primary hub for U.S. and European counterterrorism efforts in the Sahel region. They visited U.S. air bases in Agadez and Niamey, where American forces collaborate with Nigerien partners to disrupt security threats and support hostage recovery efforts. In Niamey, they met with Nigerien President Bazoum to discuss strengthening security cooperation against the growing influence of terrorist groups in the Sahel. They also met with U.S. Embassy officials, as well as the French Ambassador to Niger and the Barkhane Force Commander, to enhance counterterrorism cooperation between the U.S. and France in the region.
