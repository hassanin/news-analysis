In this memorandum, President Barack Obama emphasizes the importance of a balanced approach to regulations that promote economic growth and job creation while ensuring the health, safety, and security of the American people. He highlights the Executive Order he signed, which requires executive agencies to reduce unnecessary burdensome regulations on businesses and individuals. The government has undertaken a review of existing regulations to eliminate outdated and unjustified ones that hinder job creation and competitiveness. The goal is to reduce paperwork burdens and save billions of dollars in regulatory costs. The Executive Order also calls for agencies to consider costs and benefits, involve the public, simplify and harmonize rules, and promote flexibility and freedom of choice. President Obama encourages independent regulatory agencies to join in this review and develop their own plans to reassess and streamline regulations. He sees this as an opportunity to create a 21st-century regulatory system that strengthens the economy while fulfilling the government's responsibilities.
