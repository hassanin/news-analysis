The U.S. factory sector had one of its strongest months of economic expansion in December, with sales reaching a 14-year high. The Institute for Supply Management reported that a key manufacturing index rose to 59.7, the second-highest level since early 2011. The subindex for new orders also increased to 69.4, the highest since early 2004. The report suggests that factories will need to increase production in the first quarter of 2018 to meet demand, as inventories have fallen. Additionally, the $1.5 trillion tax cut passed by Congress is expected to increase demand in the industry this year.
