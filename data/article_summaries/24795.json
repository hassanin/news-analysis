First Lady Michelle Obama will be planting the White House Kitchen Garden for the eighth year in a row. She will be joined by students from Wisconsin, Colorado, and Louisiana who have inspiring school garden programs, as well as students from Bancroft Elementary School and Harriet Tubman Elementary School who regularly help in the White House Kitchen Garden. NASA representatives, including Deputy Administrator Dava Newman and Astronaut Cady Coleman, will also be present to plant lettuce that has been grown on the International Space Station. The event will be livestreamed on the White House website. 

On April 7, the First Lady will continue her American Garden Tour by visiting Burke County Middle School in Georgia and Philip's Academy Charter School in New Jersey to participate in planting their school gardens. Both schools have programs that aim to connect students to food and empower them to make healthy choices.
