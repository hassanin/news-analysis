President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed October 2022 as Cybersecurity Awareness Month in the United States. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of safeguarding critical infrastructure from cyber threats and protecting citizens and businesses from attacks like ransomware. Cyberattacks have a significant impact on various sectors, including the economy, national security, and day-to-day life. The government has been working to improve cybersecurity defenses, including creating a standard playbook for federal agencies and establishing security standards for software purchased by the government. However, the private sector, which operates much of the critical infrastructure, also plays a crucial role in cybersecurity. The administration is committed to partnering with private industry to ensure public safety and has implemented minimum cybersecurity standards for vital sectors of the American economy. The government is also collaborating with international partners to hold malicious cyber actors accountable and disrupt their activities. The proclamation emphasizes that cybersecurity is not limited to the government or critical infrastructure, as hackers target Americans every day. It encourages individuals to take steps to enhance their own cybersecurity, such as enabling multi-factor authentication, using trusted password managers, recognizing and reporting phishing attempts, and regularly updating software. The proclamation concludes by calling upon the people, businesses, and institutions of the United States to observe Cybersecurity Awareness Month in support of national security and resilience.
