The Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence, had a phone conversation with Mustafa Akinci, the leader of the Turkish Cypriots. Pence expressed the U.S.'s support for the resumption of UN-facilitated talks in Switzerland and hoped that the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders would agree to a settlement that would reunify Cyprus as a bizonal, bicommunal federation for the benefit of all Cypriots.
