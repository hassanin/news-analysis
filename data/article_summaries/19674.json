Vice President Biden announced that 200,000 homes have been weatherized with the Recovery Act. This has resulted in savings for low-income families on their energy bills and created jobs in the construction industry. The program aims to improve energy efficiency in homes by replacing windows and doors, adding insulation, and other measures. New Hampshire has been a leader in weatherization efforts and has exceeded its goals. The Weatherization Assistance Program is currently weatherizing approximately 25,000 homes per month nationwide. The program has also generated thousands of jobs for carpenters, electricians, and factory workers. Overall, the government has invested approximately $90 billion in energy and energy efficiency projects through the Recovery Act.
