The article is a message from the White House Office of the Press Secretary to the Senate regarding the Arms Trade Treaty. The treaty, which was signed by the United States on September 25, 2013, aims to regulate the international trade of conventional arms such as small arms, tanks, combat aircraft, and warships. Its purpose is to reduce the risk of arms transfers being used to commit atrocities while still allowing legitimate arms trade. The treaty is seen as a tool to prevent the illicit proliferation of weapons and to support international peace and security. The United States already has national control systems in place that meet or exceed the requirements of the treaty, so no further legislation is needed to comply with it. The treaty also encourages other countries to adopt similar control systems and establishes common international standards for responsible arms trade. It reaffirms the sovereign right of each country to decide how to handle arms traded within its borders and recognizes the legitimate purposes and interests for individuals and governments to own, transfer, and use conventional arms. The article recommends that the Senate consider the treaty favorably and give its advice and consent to ratification, subject to certain understandings and declarations outlined in the accompanying report.
