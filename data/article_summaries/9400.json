The White House Counsel, Stuart Delery, and Attorney General Merrick Garland, along with Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff and Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta, held a meeting to encourage strong legal representation for patients, providers, and third parties seeking or offering reproductive health care services. This meeting is part of President Biden's Executive Order Protecting Access to Reproductive Health Care Services. The recent Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned decades of constitutional protection for the right to abortion, has had significant consequences, with multiple states passing laws that make abortion illegal or heavily restricted. This threatens access to reproductive health care services for millions of Americans. The event aimed to connect the pro bono legal community with the reproductive rights, health, and justice community, with Attorney General Garland emphasizing the Department of Justice's commitment to protecting access to reproductive services. Associate Attorney General Gupta stressed the need for action and collaboration from all stakeholders. White House Counsel Delery highlighted the importance of the legal community in responding to the Dobbs decision, comparing it to the role of lawyers during the civil rights movement. The Second Gentleman called on lawyers to join the fight to defend reproductive rights and pursue justice for women.
