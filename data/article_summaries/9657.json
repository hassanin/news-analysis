President Obama has declared a major disaster in Alaska and ordered federal aid to assist with recovery efforts after severe storms, flooding, mudslides, and rockslides occurred in the area between October 6-11, 2009. The federal funding will be available to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, to help with emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in the Kodiak Island Borough. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. Dolph A. Diemont has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area, with the possibility of additional designations being made based on further damage assessments.
