During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney addressed several topics including the situation in Ukraine, the President's phone call with President Putin, and potential sanctions against Russia. Carney stated that the US supports the Ukrainian government's efforts to calm the situation in the east and urged Russia to deescalate the conflict. He also mentioned that the US is evaluating potential new sanctions and coordinating closely with European partners. On the topic of military assistance to Ukraine, Carney did not provide specific details but stated that the focus is currently on economic and diplomatic efforts to deescalate the situation. He also mentioned that there is no military solution to the crisis in Ukraine and that the best way to resolve the conflict is through negotiation and dialogue. Carney also addressed the issue of the President's moment of silence for the Boston bombing anniversary and stated that it would take place in the Oval Office during a meeting with senior advisors. He explained that the moment of silence is mostly important in Boston and that a single photographer could represent the independent media and pool the coverage, but this suggestion has been rejected in the past.
