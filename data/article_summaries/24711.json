The White House has announced major progress towards achieving the ConnectED goal of providing high-speed internet connectivity and educational technology to classrooms. The FCC and private sector have committed over $750 million in funding to deliver cutting-edge technologies to classrooms, including devices, software, teacher professional development, and home wireless connectivity. Companies such as Apple, AT&T, Autodesk, Microsoft, Oâ€™Reilly Media, Sprint, and Verizon have made significant commitments to support ConnectED and enrich K-12 education. The FCC's E-Rate program has also pledged a $2 billion down payment to connect 20 million more students to broadband and wireless. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has committed over $10 million in distance learning grants to rural schools. These efforts aim to provide next-generation connectivity to 99% of American students within five years and transform American classrooms.
