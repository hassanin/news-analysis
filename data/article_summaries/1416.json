In a National Security Council background call, senior administration officials discussed the United States' support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. The President published an op-ed in the New York Times outlining the US goals of securing a democratic, independent, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine. The US will continue to provide Ukraine with weapons and equipment to defend itself and strengthen its position at the negotiating table. The US has committed over $5 billion in security assistance since this administration came to office and has brought together a coalition of nearly 40 countries providing security assistance to Ukraine. The 11th package of security assistance will include longer-range systems, such as HIMARS and munitions, to help Ukraine strike key targets on the battlefield. The US does not seek a war with Russia and will not send American troops to fight in Ukraine or attack Russian forces. The objective is to pressure Russia to end its war on Ukraine, ensure a peaceful and stable Europe, and uphold the rules-based international order. The upcoming security assistance package is worth $700 million and includes HIMARS, counterfire radars, air surveillance radars, Javelins, anti-armor weapons, helicopters, tactical vehicles, spare parts, and equipment for maintenance. The HIMARS system has a range of about 80 kilometers and provides precision munitions for the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians have assured the US that they will not use these systems against targets in Russian territory. Further details about operational discussions were not provided.
