The Biden-Harris Administration has issued a National Spectrum Strategy and a Presidential Memorandum aimed at modernizing U.S. spectrum policy. Spectrum is crucial for America's economy, technological leadership, and security, as it supports wireless technologies and underpins digital economies. The strategy includes actions to improve spectrum management and access, such as studying the potential repurposing of over 2,700 megahertz of spectrum. It aims to ensure that both the public and private sectors have the spectrum resources needed to deliver critical services. The strategy also emphasizes the importance of spectrum policy in retaining global leadership in wireless technology and fostering innovation. The National Spectrum Strategy outlines four pillars: a spectrum pipeline for advanced technologies, collaborative long-term planning for evolving spectrum needs, unprecedented spectrum access through technology development, and expanded spectrum expertise and national awareness. The Presidential Memorandum directs federal agencies to coordinate and ensure consistent U.S. spectrum policy.
