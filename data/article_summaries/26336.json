The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has announced a public comment period to help develop criteria for designating emerging drug threats. The comment period will be open from May 15 to June 30, 2020. The ONDCP is seeking input from policy experts and individuals affected by the drug crisis, especially in light of the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal is to monitor drug threats and address harmful trends. The ONDCP is required to establish criteria for declaring or terminating an emerging drug threat declaration in the United States as part of the Substance Use Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities (SUPPORT) Act. The public comment period is the first step in this process, and the ONDCP aims to proactively identify emerging drug threats and prevent them from becoming public health emergencies.
