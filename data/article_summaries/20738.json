President Obama issued a statement on June 19, 2009, in commemoration of Juneteenth. He highlighted the significance of this day in 1865 when enslaved individuals in Galveston, Texas learned of their freedom, more than two years after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed by President Lincoln. President Obama emphasized the importance of Juneteenth as a time for reflection, celebration, and unity for the descendants of slaves and slave owners. He also mentioned the recent unanimous vote in the United States Senate supporting an apology for slavery and segregation, adding even more significance to the occasion.
