In a recent vote, the overwhelming majority of nations condemned Russia's illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory and defended the principles of the United Nations Charter. A total of 143 nations supported Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, while only four nations, including Belarus, North Korea, Nicaragua, and Syria, sided with Russia. This condemnation reflects the global consensus that Russia's actions undermine international peace and security. The world has sent a clear message that Russia cannot change borders by force and that Ukraine, like any sovereign state, has the right to determine its own future and live peacefully within its recognized borders. This united stance demonstrates the international community's determination to hold Russia accountable for its violations and protect the principles of international law and the UN Charter.
