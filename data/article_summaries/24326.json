President Barack Obama has proclaimed May 15 through May 21, 2016, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week in the United States. The proclamation aims to raise awareness about the threat posed by hurricanes and encourage individuals, government agencies, private organizations, schools, media, and residents in hurricane-prone areas to share information about preparedness and response. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of proper preparation to ensure the safety of individuals and communities, as well as the need for climate-resilient infrastructure and mitigation efforts to address the increasing intensity and rainfall of hurricanes due to climate change. The proclamation also calls for a united effort to protect the nation from devastating disasters, particularly in light of the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina.
