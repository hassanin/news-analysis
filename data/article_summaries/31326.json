Today is Space Exploration Day, a day to celebrate the role of American space exploration in our country's history. We honor the brave astronauts and space industry professionals, both past and present. After a nine-year hiatus, American astronauts have once again launched into space from American soil on rockets built by American workers. SpaceX Demonstration Mission 2 was the first crewed launch of NASA's Commercial Crew program, marking the first time a commercial company sent humans into orbit. These accomplishments have brought our country's space exploration efforts to new heights. To continue this momentum, the administration has directed NASA to return to the Moon and build a base to get humans to Mars. Through NASA's Artemis program, the United States plans to send the next man and the first woman to the Moon by 2024. The rover Perseverance will soon launch to Mars, paving the way for future American astronauts. On this day, we honor the nation's legacy of leadership in space and vow to continue the pursuit of space exploration in the 21st century.
