President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has issued an executive order to amend and expand on the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13851 of November 27, 2018, which aimed to block property of certain individuals contributing to the situation in Nicaragua. The amendments include changes to the language and provisions of the original order, such as clarifying the authority vested in the President and adding protections for freedom of expression and assembly. The order also prohibits the importation of Nicaraguan products into the United States, restricts exports to Nicaragua, and prohibits new investments in certain sectors of the Nicaraguan economy. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Commerce are granted authority to take necessary actions to implement the order, and reports on the national emergency will be submitted to Congress. The order does not affect existing authorities or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and it is subject to applicable law and appropriations.
