The article discusses a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Barack Obama in 2014, titled "Creating and Expanding Ladders of Opportunity for Boys and Young Men of Color." The memorandum addresses the persistent gaps in employment, educational outcomes, and career skills faced by boys and young men of color in the United States. The memorandum establishes the My Brother's Keeper initiative, which is an interagency effort to improve the educational and life outcomes for boys and young men of color and address the opportunity gaps they face. The initiative aims to determine effective public and private efforts, improve federal policies and programs, involve state and local officials, the private sector, and the philanthropic community, and provide coordination and support for efforts to increase opportunities and improve outcomes for boys and young men of color. The memorandum establishes a My Brother's Keeper Task Force, consisting of representatives from various executive departments and agencies, to develop a coordinated federal effort. The Task Force is directed to assess indicators of life outcomes, evaluate the impact of federal policies, create a public portal to disseminate successful programs, recommend incentives for adoption of effective strategies, provide relevant data and expertise, ensure coordination with other initiatives, highlight opportunities and challenges, and recommend means of sustaining efforts within the federal government and partnership with the private sector and philanthropic community. The Task Force focuses on evidence-based intervention points and issues facing boys and young men of color, particularly those under the age of 15, such as early childhood supports, grade school literacy, pathways to college and career, mentoring services, interactions with the criminal justice system, and violent crime. The Task Force is required to provide progress reports and recommendations to the President and publish the memorandum in the Federal Register. The memorandum is implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
