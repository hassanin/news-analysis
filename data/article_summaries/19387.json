On July 28, 2015, the President signed into law H.R. 2499, also known as the "Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015." This law prohibits the Small Business Administration (SBA) from charging a guarantee fee for express loans made under its 7(a) Loan Program to veterans or their spouses. Additionally, it increases the lending authority for SBA's 7(a) Loan Program for the fiscal year 2015 from $18.75 billion to $23.5 billion.
