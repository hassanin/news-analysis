Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom, and President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. of the United States have reviewed the progress of the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) partnership. They have reaffirmed their commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, as well as an international system that upholds human rights, the rule of law, and the peaceful resolution of disputes. The implementation of the AUKUS partnership has begun, with senior-level meetings being held since its announcement in September 2021. One of the key objectives is to determine the optimal pathway for an Australian conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarine capability by March 2023. The AUKUS partners have also made progress in advanced capabilities and have initiated work in four additional areas. They plan to engage allies and close partners as appropriate in the development of these critical defense and security capabilities.
