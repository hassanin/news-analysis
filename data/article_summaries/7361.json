In a proclamation, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. recognizes June 2022 as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex (LGBTQI+) Pride Month. He reflects on the progress made in the fight for justice, inclusion, and equality, while acknowledging that the rights of LGBTQI+ Americans are under attack. He condemns the anti-LGBTQI+ legislation introduced and passed in states across the country, particularly those targeting transgender children and their access to healthcare. The president emphasizes his administration's support for the LGBTQI+ community and vows to work against intolerance, discrimination, and injustice. He highlights the actions taken during his presidency, including signing an executive order to prevent and combat discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. However, President Biden acknowledges that there is still work to be done, calling on Congress to pass the Equality Act and address issues such as LGBTQI+ senior care, poverty, homelessness, and unemployment within the community. The proclamation concludes by honoring the resilience of LGBTQI+ individuals and affirming that their rights are human rights.
