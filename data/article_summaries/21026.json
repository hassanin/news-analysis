President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation to establish the Cesar E. Chavez National Monument in Keene, California. The monument recognizes the historic significance of the property known as Nuestra Se√±ora Reina de la Paz (Our Lady Queen of Peace), which served as the national headquarters of the United Farm Workers (UFW) movement and the home and workplace of civil rights leader Cesar Chavez. The property played a pivotal role in the farm worker movement and witnessed significant achievements, including the passage of the Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975. The monument encompasses approximately 10.5 acres of land and will be managed by the National Park Service. The management plan for the monument will focus on preserving the historic resources, commemorating the life and work of Cesar Chavez, and interpreting the struggles and achievements of the broader farm worker movement. The National Park Service will collaborate with the National Chavez Center and other organizations to provide visitor services and interpretive opportunities. The establishment of the monument does not revoke any existing withdrawals, reservations, or appropriations.
