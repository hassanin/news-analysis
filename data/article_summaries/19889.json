This executive order, signed by President Barack Obama on August 3, 2016, amends Executive Order 13675 to expand the membership on the President's Advisory Council on Doing Business in Africa. The purpose of this order is to promote economic growth and job creation in both the United States and Africa by encouraging U.S. companies to trade with and invest in Africa. The Trade Africa Initiative, launched in 2014, aims to strengthen the commercial relationship between the United States and Sub-Saharan Africa. The Council was established in November 2014 to advise on this engagement, and with this amendment, the membership of the Council is increased from 15 to 26 private sector corporate members. The order clarifies that it does not affect the authority granted by law to executive departments and agencies or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It also does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other entity.
