Second Lady Karen Pence visited the Corporal Michael J. Crescenz Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Philadelphia for a roundtable discussion on mental health. The discussion focused on President Trump's recent Executive Order addressing mental and behavioral health needs and suicide prevention. Participants shared personal stories about how the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns have affected their mental health. According to a CDC study, anxiety and depression symptoms have increased significantly during the lockdowns, with a significant proportion of Americans reporting adverse mental health conditions and considering suicide. The Executive Order establishes a working group to assess the mental health needs of vulnerable groups and provides resources for crisis intervention, follow-up care, and mental health treatment services. Second Lady Karen Pence serves as the Lead Ambassador for PREVENTS, a national health campaign aimed at preventing suicide.
