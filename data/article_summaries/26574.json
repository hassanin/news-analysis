On the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, the US government reaffirms its commitment to combat the drug abuse epidemic. Opioids, particularly fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, are causing a significant number of overdose deaths in the country. The administration is taking aggressive actions to dismantle criminal networks involved in drug trafficking and is collaborating with international partners to bring them to justice. In 2017, Customs and Border Protection seized over 1,100 pounds of fentanyl, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested criminal aliens with over 76,000 charges and convictions for drug crimes. The Department of Justice also prosecuted over 3,000 defendants for opioid-related crimes. The government is expanding efforts to combat drug demand and the opioid crisis, dedicating more resources to educate Americans about the dangers of opioids, interrupting illicit drug supply chains, and increasing access to evidence-based treatment and recovery support services. The administration has secured at least $6 billion in new funding for these efforts. The government aims to bring justice to drug traffickers and end the devastation caused by drug addiction.
