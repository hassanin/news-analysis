This article discusses the continuation of the national emergency declared by President Biden in Executive Order 13566, which was issued on February 25, 2011. The national emergency was declared in response to the actions of Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, his government, and close associates, who posed an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The article also mentions the expansion of the national emergency through Executive Order 13726, signed on April 19, 2016. The ongoing violence in Libya, including attacks on state facilities, foreign missions, and critical infrastructure, as well as human rights abuses and violations of the arms embargo, are highlighted as factors contributing to the threat. The continuation of the national emergency is deemed necessary to protect against the diversion of assets and other abuses by members of Qadhafi's family, their associates, and individuals hindering Libyan national reconciliation. The notice of the continuation is published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
