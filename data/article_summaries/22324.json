President Barack Obama has proclaimed September 2013 as National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month in the United States. The proclamation recognizes the millions of Americans who are taking steps towards recovery from alcohol and drug addiction and celebrates their strength and determination. The theme for this year's observance is "Together on Pathways to Wellness," which encourages all Americans to support and walk alongside those who are fighting addiction. The proclamation highlights the importance of evidence-based approaches to recovery, viewing addiction as a preventable and treatable disease of the brain. The National Drug Control Strategy and the Affordable Care Act are mentioned as efforts to increase access to treatment and recovery services, as well as expand mental health and substance use disorder benefits for millions of Americans. The proclamation calls for unity in preventing addiction, providing hope to those struggling with the disease, and celebrating those on the path to recovery.
