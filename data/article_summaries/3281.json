In this letter, Dana A. Remus, Counsel to the President, responds to David Ferriero, Archivist of the United States, regarding a set of documents requested by the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. The letter states that President Biden has determined that an assertion of executive privilege is not in the best interests of the United States and is therefore not justified for any of the requested documents. It emphasizes the need for a full accounting of the January 6th attack and the importance of understanding the circumstances that led to it. The letter argues that the constitutional protections of executive privilege should not be used to shield information that reflects an effort to subvert the Constitution itself. It concludes by stating that the President's determination applies only to the documents provided to the White House on September 8, 2021, and that further materials will be reviewed and responded to at an appropriate time.
