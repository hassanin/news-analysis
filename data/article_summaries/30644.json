The Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, discusses President Trump's executive order aimed at reducing reliance on government programs and promoting economic independence for Americans. Perdue emphasizes the importance of self-sufficiency and the goal of helping individuals and families move from government assistance programs, such as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), back into the workforce. He believes that long-term government dependency goes against the American dream and that work and responsibility are essential for improving lives. Perdue acknowledges the barriers that some SNAP participants face and suggests efforts such as training programs and coordination with employers to help them find employment. The overall goal is to enhance the dignity of individuals, assist those truly in need, and move people out of poverty.
