The resignation of Bolivian President Evo Morales is seen as a significant moment for democracy in the Western Hemisphere. Morales's attempt to override the Bolivian constitution and the will of the people led to his departure, which is seen as preserving democracy and giving the Bolivian people a chance to have their voices heard. The United States applauds the Bolivian people for demanding freedom and the Bolivian military for upholding their oath to protect the constitution. These events are seen as a message to illegitimate regimes in Venezuela and Nicaragua that democracy and the will of the people will always prevail. It is seen as a step closer to a completely democratic, prosperous, and free Western Hemisphere.
