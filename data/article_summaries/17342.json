The article discusses the passage of the American Jobs and Closing Loopholes Act by the House of Representatives. The bill aims to provide relief to families and businesses during the economic downturn by extending unemployment benefits, providing tax cuts for individuals and businesses, and supporting small businesses through increased lending efforts. It also includes funding to settle discrimination claims by African-American farmers and to resolve the Cobell case. The bill is fully funded by closing loopholes that allow corporations to avoid taxes and ensuring that investment managers pay the same tax rates as the average American worker. The President urges the Senate to act swiftly on the bill and calls for additional measures to support healthcare benefits for the unemployed, assistance to states, and proposals to support small businesses and energy efficiency.
