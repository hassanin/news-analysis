President Barack Obama congratulates President Yanukovych on the removal of highly enriched uranium (HEU) from Ukraine for secure disposal in Russia. This action is seen as a step towards securing all vulnerable nuclear materials and is in line with the commitments made by President Yanukovych and other world leaders at the Nuclear Security Summit. The shipment of HEU is accompanied by low enriched uranium and nuclear safety equipment, which will support Ukraine's development of safe and secure nuclear energy. These actions demonstrate Ukraine's commitment to preventing nuclear weapons from falling into the hands of terrorists and working towards a world without nuclear weapons.
