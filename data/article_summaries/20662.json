The National Security Advisor, Tom Donilon, met with a delegation from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) at the White House to discuss the crisis in Cote d’Ivoire. The delegation was led by President Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone and included other high-ranking officials. Donilon expressed support for ECOWAS' efforts to ensure a peaceful transition of power in Cote d’Ivoire and reaffirmed the commitment to see Alassane Ouattara become the President while former President Laurent Gbagbo cedes power. They also discussed the importance of maintaining international unity on this issue. Both parties agreed to continue coordinating closely in the future.
