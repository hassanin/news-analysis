President Donald Trump has submitted a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in response to certain terrorist attacks on September 14, 2001, will continue beyond its anniversary date of September 14, 2017. The President believes that the threat of terrorism still persists and that the emergency declaration is necessary to enable the Armed Forces of the United States to address this ongoing threat both domestically and globally.
