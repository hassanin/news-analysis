The White House has released a statement on the twelfth annual International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C). The statement expresses solidarity with the millions of women and girls worldwide who have undergone FGM/C and calls for an end to this harmful practice. FGM/C is considered a serious human rights abuse and a form of gender-based violence. The U.S. government invests in community-led programs to eliminate FGM/C and address its effects, both domestically and internationally. The statement applauds the efforts of partner governments, NGOs, and multilateral institutions in combating FGM/C, which have resulted in progress in establishing laws against it and increasing awareness about its need to end. The call for zero tolerance for FGM/C is renewed.
