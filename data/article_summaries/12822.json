President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, providing federal aid to help with recovery efforts from severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred between June 26 and July 11, 2013. The funding will be available for emergency work, repairing or replacing damaged facilities, and implementing hazard mitigation measures. The declaration covers ten counties, and additional designations may be made in the future if necessary. Donald L. Keldsen has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area.
