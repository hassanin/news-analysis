This article discusses a presidential memorandum issued by President Donald Trump on December 23, 2019. The memorandum addresses legal and societal barriers to women's global development and prosperity. The policy aims to enhance opportunities for women to participate in and benefit from economic opportunities. The memorandum establishes the Women's Global Development and Prosperity (W-GDP) Initiative, with a focus on addressing factors that hinder women's economic potential, such as unpaid care burdens, gender-based violence, underinvestment in education, spousal approval for employment, and legal barriers to participation in certain professions. The memorandum outlines five areas of emphasis for action, including lifting restrictions on women's authority to sign legal documents, ensuring equal access to credit and capital, addressing constraints on property ownership and inheritance, eliminating restrictions on freedom of movement, and eliminating barriers based on sex in working hours, occupations, and tasks. The memorandum also directs relevant agencies to develop action plans for addressing these areas in developing countries.
