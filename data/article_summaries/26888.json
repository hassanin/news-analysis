Johnson & Johnson has announced that their COVID-19 vaccine candidate has reached the final stage of clinical trials, making it the fourth vaccine candidate in the US to reach this stage. The vaccine development has been accelerated due to the support of Operation Warp Speed. The Trump administration has awarded $200 million of CARES Act funding to all 50 states to prepare for the distribution of the vaccine to high-risk individuals as soon as it is approved. The administration is also focused on accelerating the development of lifesaving therapies, such as monoclonal antibody treatments. The fatality rate has been reduced by 85% since April, and the survival rate for individuals under 50 is 99.98%. Early research suggests that the spread of COVID-19 in schools is minimal, with only a small percentage of students and teachers testing positive. The number of patients visiting emergency rooms due to the virus is at its lowest since the pandemic began. The administration has provided funding and resources to nursing homes to protect vulnerable residents, and rapid testing devices have been sent to nursing homes across the country. The administration is encouraging Americans to get the flu vaccine as flu season approaches, as it may help prevent a potential surge in cases when combined with COVID-19. The economy has shown signs of recovery, with job creation, retail sales, and manufacturing all increasing. The administration is also preparing to nominate a new Supreme Court Justice.
