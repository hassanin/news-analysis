President Trump's first two weeks in office have focused on prioritizing putting Americans back to work. He has taken action to stimulate job creation by rebuilding the nation, renegotiating U.S. trade deals, and ensuring U.S. job creation. Additionally, he has been working to reduce government barriers to job creation by removing burdensome regulations and streamlining government processes. President Trump has also engaged with the private sector, meeting with business leaders, union leaders, and other influential stakeholders to discuss removing government barriers to job creation and reversing the trend of companies shifting U.S. jobs overseas.
