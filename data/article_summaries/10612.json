The Obama Administration released a report and interactive maps highlighting the benefits of the American Jobs Act investments in education. The report analyzes the condition of America's schools, which are in disrepair, and the challenges faced by school districts and teachers. The proposed investments include $25 billion to renovate and modernize public schools, $5 billion to upgrade community college infrastructure, and $30 billion to retain educators. The investments would create jobs and improve the quality of education. The report also includes interactive maps that show the estimated impact of the American Jobs Act on every state and school district.
