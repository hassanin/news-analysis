The press briefing covered a range of topics including trade, the Supreme Court decision on King-Burwell, FIFA, the economy, the Export-Import Bank, the Rohingya minority in Burma, tracking ISIS propaganda, and the upcoming 10 year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. On trade, the White House is confident in the progress being made to pass trade legislation in the House of Representatives. On King-Burwell, the White House is confident in the legal case that was presented before the Supreme Court and believes that the President's health care legislation is based on a sound legal basis. The White House is also confident that the President's strategy to combat ISIS is making progress, but acknowledges that there is more work to be done. Finally, the White House is not concerned about the recent polls showing a drop in approval ratings for the President or the disapproval of his handling of ISIS, as the President is focused on the national security interests of the United States and the long-term progress being made.
