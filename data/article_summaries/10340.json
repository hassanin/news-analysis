The article is about an executive order issued by President Barack Obama in August 2013. The order prohibits the importation of Burmese jadeite and rubies into the United States, as well as any jewelry containing these gemstones.

The order provides definitions for terms such as jadeite, rubies, articles of jewelry, person, and entity.

The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to take necessary actions to enforce the order. The order also waives certain sanctions described in the JADE Act in the national interest of the United States. It states that the order does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States. The order became effective on August 7, 2013.
