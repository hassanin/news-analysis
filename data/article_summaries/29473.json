Data released by the Census Bureau reveals that 2019 was a remarkable year for improving the living standards of Americans. Real median household income reached an all-time high of $68,700, representing a 6.8 percent increase, the largest one-year increase on record. Minority groups, including black, Hispanic, and Asian Americans, experienced significant gains in income. Income inequality also decreased for the second consecutive year. Additionally, poverty reached a record low of 10.5 percent, with over 4 million people lifted out of poverty between 2018 and 2019. Poverty rates for black, Hispanic, and Asian Americans all saw significant decreases. Child poverty also fell to a near 50-year low. These improvements were driven by an increase in the number of workers, particularly women. It's worth noting that data collection efforts for these estimates were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, but the quality of the data remained consistent with Census Bureau standards. Overall, the data highlights the positive impact of pro-growth policies under the Trump Administration, although the pandemic has disrupted progress in 2020.
