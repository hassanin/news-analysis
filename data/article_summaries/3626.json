The United States strongly condemns the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) for its recent test of an Intercontinental ballistic missile. The President and his national security team are assessing the situation in close coordination with allies and partners. This launch, along with other ballistic missile tests conducted by the DPRK this week, violates multiple UN Security Council resolutions and increases tensions in the region. The DPRK's actions prioritize its weapons of mass destruction and missile programs over the well-being of its people. The United States calls on all countries to condemn these violations and urges the DPRK to stop its destabilizing actions and engage in serious dialogue. The US is committed to ensuring the security of the American homeland, as well as its allies in South Korea and Japan.
