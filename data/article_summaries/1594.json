The Biden Administration is facilitating the air shipment of approximately 1.65 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Nestl√© NAN SupremePro 2 infant formula from Germany to Fort Worth, Texas. This is part of Operation Fly Formula, a program launched by President Biden to speed up the import of infant formula and get it to stores faster. The Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Agriculture, the General Services Administration, and the Department of Defense are partnering to pick up overseas infant formula that meets US health and safety standards. So far, Operation Fly Formula has completed 32 flights and imported almost 19 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of infant formula. The Biden Administration has also taken other actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula, including invoking the Defense Production Act and issuing guidance for formula manufacturers to safely import formula that is not currently being produced for the US market.
