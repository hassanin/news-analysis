On October 27, 2006, President Trump declared a national emergency regarding the situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This was done in response to the widespread violence and atrocities in the country, which posed a threat to regional stability and the foreign policy of the United States. To address this emergency, measures were put in place to block the property of individuals contributing to the conflict. In 2014, additional steps were taken to address the national emergency. The situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to pose a threat to US foreign policy, and therefore, the national emergency declared in 2006 and amended in 2014 will continue for another year. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
