On March 3, 2020, the President signed three laws into effect. The first law, H.J.Res. 80, allows the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to refer certain veterans for dental care in the community. The second law, S. 394, known as the "Presidential Transition Enhancement Act of 2019," makes changes to how the General Services Administration provides services and facilities to Presidents-elect and Vice Presidents-elect, as well as other changes to the Presidential transition process. The third law, S. 2107, titled the "Protecting America's Food and Agriculture Act of 2019," authorizes the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Customs and Border Protection to hire additional agricultural specialists, agricultural technicians, and canine inspection teams to enhance the security of the nation's food supply.
