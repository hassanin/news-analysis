First Lady Melania Trump visited the Vanderbilt Children's Hospital in Tennessee as part of her Be Best campaign. She participated in a roundtable discussion on neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) and met with children who are currently patients at the hospital. She also spoke with a family affected by NAS and delivered fleece baby blankets to patients and families. Mrs. Trump expressed her gratitude to Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital for hosting her and for their work on NAS. She emphasized the importance of raising awareness and educating people on the dangers of NAS and removing the stigma of addiction.
