President Joe Biden has declared a major disaster in Pennsylvania and authorized federal assistance to aid in the recovery efforts from the remnants of Hurricane Ida. The declaration makes federal funding available to individuals in the counties of Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, Philadelphia, and York. This assistance can include grants for temporary housing, home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Hazard mitigation measures for the entire state will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. E. Craig Levy, Sr. has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing, and additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated once the assessments are complete. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate seven days a week from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. local time. For further information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
