This article is a Presidential Proclamation issued by President Barack Obama on June 30, 2010. The proclamation modifies the duty-free treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). The GSP is a program that allows preferential tariff treatment for certain articles imported from beneficiary developing countries. The proclamation states that beneficiary developing countries are subject to competitive need limitations on the preferential treatment under the GSP. However, the President has the authority to disregard these limitations for eligible articles if the imports of such articles do not exceed a certain value. The proclamation also mentions that any waivers granted under the GSP shall remain in effect until the President determines that they are no longer warranted due to changed circumstances. The President has determined to designate certain articles as eligible articles when imported from any beneficiary developing country. However, the duty-free treatment for certain articles from certain beneficiary developing countries is terminated as they exceeded the applicable competitive need limitations. The competitive need limitation is also disregarded for certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing countries. The previously granted waiver of the competitive need limitations is revoked due to changed circumstances. The President has the authority to modify the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) to reflect the provisions of the Trade Act of 1974 and other relevant acts. The proclamation modifies the HTS to implement the changes mentioned. Any previous proclamations and executive orders inconsistent with this proclamation are superseded.
