The United States has welcomed the peace agreement between the Afghan government and Hizb-e Islami Gulbuddin (HIG). The agreement, which was negotiated and signed by both parties, is seen as a positive step towards restoring peace and stability in Afghanistan. The United States supports an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned peace process in which armed groups cease violence, cut ties with international terrorist groups, and uphold the Constitution, including protections for women and minorities.
