On June 4, 2009, the White House announced that they would be delivering Judge Sonia Sotomayor's questionnaire to the Senate Judiciary Committee at 2:00PM EDT. This was just 9 days after she was nominated to the Supreme Court, making it the swiftest completion of a questionnaire in recent history. In comparison, Chief Justice Roberts took 13 days, Justice Ginsburg took 15 days, and Justice Alito took 30 days to complete their questionnaires after being nominated.
