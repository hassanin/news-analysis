First Lady Michelle Obama has partnered with the Partnership for a Healthier America (PHA) and actress Eva Longoria to promote drinking more water as a way to improve health and well-being. The new effort brings together more than a dozen organizations committed to encouraging everyone to drink more water more often. It is estimated that approximately one fourth of children do not drink any water on a given day. The campaign aims to remind people that drinking more water helps increase energy, focus, and overall health. Supporters of the campaign will carry the Drink Up logo on nearly 300 million packs of bottled water, more than half a billion bottles of water, reusable bottles, and outdoor public taps. Cities will also be utilizing the logo to encourage people to drink more tap water. Additionally, hosts on a dozen TV shows are participating in a day of drinking water and encouraging their audience to Drink Up. People are also encouraged to upload pictures of themselves drinking water on the campaign's website or on Instagram using the hashtag #drinkH2O. The campaign has received support from various organizations including marketing, research, and creative companies, water filter and reusable water bottle companies, municipalities, public drinking stations, bottled water brands, industry groups, foundations, non-profits, and media companies.
