President Obama will be awarding the Medal of Honor to Private First Class Anthony T. Kaho'ohanohano and Private First Class Henry Svehla for their acts of gallantry. Private First Class Kaho'ohanohano will receive the award posthumously for his actions in combat in 1951 during the Korean War. Despite facing overwhelming numbers, he ordered his squad to take up better positions and provided covering fire for the friendly force. He then returned to his original position and engaged the enemy alone, using grenades and ammunition until he was killed. His bravery inspired his comrades to launch a counterattack that repulsed the enemy. Private First Class Svehla will also receive the award posthumously for his actions in combat in 1952 during the Korean War. When his platoon's attack began to falter, he charged the enemy positions, firing his weapon and throwing grenades. He sacrificed himself by throwing himself on an enemy grenade that landed near his comrades, ultimately leading to his own death. The Medal of Honor is given to members of the Armed Forces who display exceptional bravery and self-sacrifice in the face of great danger.
