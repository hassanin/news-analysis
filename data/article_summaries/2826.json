President Biden joined the Senate Democratic Caucus lunch meeting to advocate for the quick passage of the American Rescue Plan and gather input from senators. He emphasized the widespread support the package has garnered, including from both Democrats and Republicans, state and local leaders, labor, and the business community. The President stressed the urgency of passing the bill to accelerate the vaccination process and safely reopen schools. As the Senate prepares to address the Rescue Plan, Biden urged the caucus to remain united in their commitment to passing a substantial package that addresses the economic and health crises. He also emphasized the need to act swiftly before unemployment benefits for approximately 11 million Americans expire on March 14.
