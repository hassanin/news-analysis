President Donald J. Trump has issued a Presidential Determination pursuant to Section 303 of the Defense Production Act of 1950. This determination states that the domestic production capability for AN/SSQ series sonobuoys is essential to national defense. The President has determined that without his action, the United States industry would not be able to adequately and timely provide the production capability for these sonobuoys. The memorandum also states that purchases, purchase commitments, or other actions under Section 303 of the Act are the most cost-effective, expedient, and practical alternative method for meeting the need for this critical capability. The memorandum is authorized and directed to be published in the Federal Register.
