President Biden has declared a major disaster in Kentucky due to severe storms, winds, flooding, and tornadoes that occurred starting from December 10, 2021. Federal aid will be provided to supplement recovery efforts in the affected areas. Assistance for individuals may include grants for temporary housing, home repairs, and low-cost loans for uninsured property losses. Local governments and nonprofit organizations can also receive federal funding for emergency work. Additionally, hazard mitigation measures for the entire state are eligible for cost-sharing. John Brogan has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing, and more counties and forms of assistance may be designated later. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance starting tomorrow through the DisasterAssistance.gov website or by calling the FEMA hotline.
