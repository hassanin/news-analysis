This article is a notice from the White House stating the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Sudan. The national emergency was first declared on November 3, 1997, due to the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan posing a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The conflict in Sudan's Darfur region was also identified as an unusual and extraordinary threat, leading to the expansion of the national emergency in 2006. Additional steps were taken in October 2006 to implement the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006. The notice explains that because the Government of Sudan's actions and policies still pose a threat, the national emergency must continue beyond November 3, 2011. The continuation of the national emergency is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress. The notice is signed by President Barack Obama.
