The G20 Leaders' Communiqué highlights the global priority of raising global growth to improve living standards and create quality jobs. The global recovery is slow and uneven, and there is a shortfall in demand that is holding back the global economy. The leaders commit to working together to lift growth, boost economic resilience, and strengthen global institutions. They aim to achieve strong, sustainable, and balanced growth by implementing structural reforms, ensuring appropriate macroeconomic policies, and supporting investment, trade, and competition. The leaders also emphasize the importance of addressing unemployment, reducing inequality, and eradicating poverty. They discuss the need to strengthen the resilience of the global economy and stability of the financial system, as well as taking actions to ensure the fairness of the international tax system and to strengthen global institutions. The communiqué concludes with a commitment to continue working together to lift economic growth, support job creation, promote development, and build global confidence.
