On June 6, 2018, President Trump signed the VA Mission Act of 2018, which aims to transform the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) into a high-performing and integrated healthcare system for the 21st century. The law puts patient choice at the core of the VA program, allowing veterans to seek healthcare outside of the VA system if their needs are not met in a timely manner. The VA Mission Act achieves five objectives for veterans' care and comes at a crucial moment as the funding for the current Choice program is expected to be exhausted soon. The Trump Administration had urged Congress to pass the bill by Memorial Day to prevent disruptions to care. The Administration remains committed to implementing policies that transform and modernize the VA, as well as broader healthcare reforms for all Americans.
