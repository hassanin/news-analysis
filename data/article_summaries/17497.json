The President of the United States has approved a Presidential Policy Directive that aims to further normalize relations with Cuba. This directive takes a comprehensive approach to engaging with the Cuban government and people and seeks to make the opening to Cuba irreversible. Since announcing the process of normalizing relations in 2014, the U.S. has made progress in re-establishing diplomatic relations, opening embassies, expanding travel and commerce, and launching initiatives for cooperation and innovation. The new directive consolidates and builds upon these changes, promotes transparency, and encourages further engagement between the two countries. The Departments of Treasury and Commerce have also issued regulatory changes to facilitate more interaction between the Cuban and American people, including through travel and commercial opportunities, and to provide more access to information. While challenges and differences between the two governments remain, the President believes that engagement is the best way to address these issues and make progress on shared interests and values. The progress made over the last two years, along with the recent action, serves as a reminder of what is possible when looking towards the future together.
