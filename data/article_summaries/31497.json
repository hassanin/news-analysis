President Donald J. Trump has signed an Executive Grant of Clemency, granting a full pardon to Jon Ponder. Ponder is the founder and CEO of Hope for Prisoners, Inc., an organization he established after serving a 63-month sentence for several robberies. While in prison, Ponder became a Christian and dedicated his life to helping other prisoners. Hope for Prisoners is a re-entry program that assists former inmates in reuniting with their families, finding employment, and reintegrating into the community. The program provides professional development, character education, leadership skills, financial literacy, technology training, and other life skills to former inmates. It also pairs them with mentors from law enforcement, the judicial system, the business community, and the faith community to aid their transition. Through a partnership with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, Hope for Prisoners enlists police officers to help former inmates rebuild their lives. The organization has served thousands of formerly incarcerated individuals in the Las Vegas area. Ponder has received support from civic leaders in the Las Vegas area, and he was granted a pardon by the State of Nevada earlier this year. President Trump has granted the pardon to Ponder based on his contributions to improving the Las Vegas community and his dedication to giving others a second chance.
