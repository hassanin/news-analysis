In this statement, the President acknowledges the efforts of his administration, led by EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, in taking significant actions to protect the environment and public health from air pollution. These actions include reducing toxic air pollution from power plants and improving fuel efficiency in vehicles. The President emphasizes that these steps will save lives, reduce pollution, and provide economic benefits. However, he also recognizes the need to reduce regulatory burdens and uncertainty for the economy. As a result, he requests the withdrawal of the draft Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards for now, with plans to reconsider them in 2013 after updating the scientific review. The President assures his commitment to protecting public health and the environment and opposes any attempts to weaken the EPA's authority or dismantle the progress made thus far.
