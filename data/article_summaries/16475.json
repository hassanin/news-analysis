President Barack Obama has transmitted a social security totalization agreement with Brazil to Congress. The agreement aims to eliminate dual social security coverage and taxation between the United States and Brazil, as well as prevent the loss of benefits for individuals who divide their careers between the two countries. The agreement is similar in objective to social security agreements already in force with several European Union countries, Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Norway, the Republic of Korea, and Switzerland. The agreements contain all provisions mandated by the Social Security Act and other provisions deemed appropriate by President Obama. The Department of State and the Social Security Administration have recommended the agreements to the President. A report on the estimated number of individuals affected by the agreements and their cost effect has also been transmitted for the information of Congress.
