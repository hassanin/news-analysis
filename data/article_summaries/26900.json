The Trump administration strongly supports the candidacy of Ken Isaacs as Director General for the International Organization for Migration (IOM). They believe it is crucial to have someone who understands Washington and can advocate effectively for the IOM's mission. With Isaacs at the helm, they believe the IOM will use donor funding wisely and efficiently to fulfill its critical mission. Vice President Mike Pence has praised Isaacs for his integrity, years of service, and record of results. Isaacs' 34 years of humanitarian work demonstrate his commitment to helping displaced and vulnerable people. If elected, he will treat people fairly, equally, and with dignity and respect.
