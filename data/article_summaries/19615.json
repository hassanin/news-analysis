President Obama has declared a major disaster in the Commonwealth of Virginia and has authorized federal aid to support recovery efforts in the region affected by Hurricane Irene. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to the commonwealth and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The funding is available on a cost-sharing basis. Hazard mitigation measures are also eligible for federal funding. Donald L. Keldsen has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional counties may be designated for assistance once damage assessments are completed. For more information, contact the FEMA News Desk.
