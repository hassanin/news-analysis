President Barack Obama has proclaimed the week of August 5th to August 11th, 2012 as National Health Center Week. This proclamation recognizes the important role that health centers play in providing affordable and accessible primary care services to millions of Americans. Health centers not only provide treatment for those in need but also emphasize preventive care to help people lead healthier lives. They serve 20 million Americans from all walks of life and help reduce emergency room visits and ease healthcare burdens for families across the country. The Obama Administration has been working to support health centers by providing resources and funding through initiatives like the Affordable Care Act and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The proclamation encourages all Americans to celebrate National Health Center Week by visiting their local health center, meeting health center providers, and exploring the programs they offer.
