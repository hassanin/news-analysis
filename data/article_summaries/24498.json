On May 27, 2010, the President signed three bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 5014, clarifies that certain health care programs determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs would qualify as minimum essential coverage for the purposes of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The second bill, S. 1782, the "Federal Judiciary Administrative Improvements Act of 2010," makes changes to several Federal court procedures to improve the administration of Federal courts. The third bill, S. 3333, the "Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010," extends the licenses that permit satellite television service providers to retransmit television broadcast station signals to subscribers located within a station's local market area. It also allows satellite television service providers to offer broadcast network signals to subscribers who cannot receive such signals through a conventional television antenna.
