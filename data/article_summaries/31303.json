President Trump signed an executive order to expand "Made in America" production, bring manufacturing jobs back to the US, and ensure access to life-saving medicines. The order directs the Department of Health and Human Services to use the Defense Production Act to buy essential medicines and equipment from within the US. It also prioritizes domestic manufacturers during the regulatory review of pharmaceutical ingredients and essential medicines. The goal is to reduce reliance on foreign nations for essential supplies and protect American jobs. President Trump has been a strong advocate for buying and hiring American and has achieved trade accomplishments such as replacing NAFTA with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and holding China accountable.
