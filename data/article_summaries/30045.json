President Donald J. Trump has decided not to renew the Significant Reduction Exceptions (SREs) for Iran's oil exports when they expire in early May. This decision aims to bring Iran's oil exports down to zero, cutting off the regime's main source of revenue. The United States, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, along with other allies, are committed to ensuring that global oil markets remain adequately supplied even as all Iranian oil is removed from the market. The Trump Administration and its allies are determined to sustain and expand the maximum economic pressure campaign against Iran to counter its destabilizing activities in the Middle East. This decision comes after designating the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, demonstrating the US commitment to disrupting Iran's terror network and changing the regime's behavior. The support of friends and allies for this effort is welcomed.
