In this article, the White House identifies several countries as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries for the fiscal year 2010. The countries listed include Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Venezuela. The article states that a country's presence on the list does not necessarily reflect its counternarcotics efforts or cooperation with the United States. It explains that these countries are placed on the list due to a combination of geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drug trafficking to occur despite enforcement efforts. The article also designates Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela as countries that have failed to adhere to international counternarcotics agreements. It discusses the drug trafficking challenges faced by various countries, such as Afghanistan's role as the largest producer of opium poppy, Pakistan's role as a transit country for opiates and hashish, and the increasing drug trafficking in Central America. The article emphasizes the importance of supporting programs to aid Venezuela's democratic institutions and bilateral programs in Bolivia for the national interests of the United States. It concludes by mentioning the efforts of countries like Canada and India to address drug-related challenges and the cooperation between the United States and these countries in disrupting the flow of drugs.
