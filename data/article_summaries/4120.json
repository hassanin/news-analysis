On December 26, 2023, the President signed three bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 1722, called the "Grand Ronde Reservation Act Amendment of 2023," clarifies that the land claim settlement only extinguishes the Tribe's claims for a specific parcel of land. The second bill, H.R. 2839, amends the Siletz Reservation Act to define the Tribe's hunting, fishing, trapping, and gathering rights. Lastly, H.R. 6503, known as the "Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2023, Part II," extends Federal Aviation Administration authorities and related revenue authorities until March 8, 2024. The President thanked the representatives, senators, and the entire Oregon delegation for their leadership on these bills.
