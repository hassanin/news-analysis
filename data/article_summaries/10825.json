In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims May 12-16, 2014 as National Small Business Week. He highlights the importance of small businesses in the United States, stating that they employ half of the country's workforce and create the majority of new jobs. The Obama Administration has focused on creating an environment where small businesses can thrive, including adding tax breaks for small businesses, providing support through the Small Business Administration (SBA), and cutting down on the time it takes for the government to pay small business contractors. The Administration has also worked to ease burdens on businesses, such as eliminating SBA fees on loans under $150,000 and waiving fees for veterans. The Affordable Care Act has made it easier for small business owners to purchase health insurance and provides tax credits to help cover the cost of providing coverage for employees. The Administration is committed to protecting tax credits that help small businesses hire and incentivizing higher wages. President Obama calls for a more level playing field to allow the best ideas to prosper and for America to continue to thrive.
