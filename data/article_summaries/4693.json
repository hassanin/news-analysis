Vice President Kamala Harris announced that the United States is committing not to conduct destructive, direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) missile testing. The goal is to establish this as a new international norm for responsible behavior in space. The Vice President called on other nations to make similar commitments and work together to establish this norm. This commitment addresses the threat to the security and sustainability of space, as demonstrated by Russia's recent ASAT missile test. The destruction of space objects through such testing poses risks to satellites, space objects, and astronauts. Developing a shared understanding of safe and responsible space activities reduces the risk of miscommunication and miscalculation. This commitment also protects U.S. interests in space exploration, science, and economic development. The Biden-Harris Administration aims to engage the international community to uphold and strengthen a rules-based international order for space. The United States will lead in the development of new measures that contribute to the safety, stability, security, and long-term sustainability of space activities.
