President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring April 2013 as National Donate Life Month. There are currently over 115,000 individuals on the waiting list for an organ transplant in the United States. The proclamation emphasizes the need for organ and tissue donation and encourages Americans to learn more about the process, consider signing up for their state's registry, and discuss their decision with family and friends. The goal is to address the shortage of organ donors and provide life-saving care to those in need. The President calls upon healthcare professionals, volunteers, educators, government agencies, faith-based and community groups, and private organizations to work together to increase the number of organ and tissue donors in the country.
