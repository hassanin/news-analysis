In this statement by NSC spokesperson Caitlin Hayden, it is condemned that Russian military vehicles, disguised as civilian trucks, have entered Ukraine in violation of international law. The convoy was supposed to be a humanitarian mission, but it did not have the required inspection and escort by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Russia has no right to send vehicles or personnel into Ukraine without permission from the Ukrainian government. The primary barrier to delivering humanitarian aid has been the lack of security guarantees from the Russia-backed separatists. Russia also maintains a large military force on the Ukrainian border and has been escalating the conflict. The international community is concerned about Russia's true intentions. Russia is accused of creating the humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine and could alleviate it by stopping the supply of weapons and fighters to its proxies. This action is seen as a flagrant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and Russia is urged to remove its vehicles and personnel from Ukraine immediately.
