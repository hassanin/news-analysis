President Donald J. Trump has declared a state of emergency in South Carolina due to the conditions resulting from Hurricane Florence. This declaration allows the Department of Homeland Security, specifically the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster relief efforts to alleviate the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency. FEMA is authorized to provide equipment and resources as necessary to mitigate the impacts of the emergency. The federal government will provide 75% funding for emergency protective measures. Elizabeth Turner has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
