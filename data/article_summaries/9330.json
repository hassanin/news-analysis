During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki announced that President Biden has directed the Department of Energy to make 50 million barrels of oil available from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to lower gas prices for the American people. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm joined the briefing to provide more details on the President's actions. Granholm explained that the global mismatch between supply and demand is causing high energy prices, and the administration is using every tool available to address the issue. She also mentioned that the President has asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the price difference between unfinished gas and gasoline at the pump. Granholm stated that the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, along with actions from other major economies, has already led to a nearly 10% decrease in oil prices. The administration is hopeful that this will help stabilize and lower gas prices. Granholm also emphasized the importance of transitioning to clean energy sources in the long term to protect consumers from energy price shocks. The briefing also touched on topics such as cybersecurity, small business support, and the President's views on certain issues.
