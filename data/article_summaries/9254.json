President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has notified the Speaker of the House and the President of his intent to terminate the designation of the Central African Republic, Gabon, Niger, and Uganda as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). This decision is based on the determination that these countries do not meet the eligibility requirements of the AGOA. The Central African Republic has violated human rights and has not made progress in protecting worker rights, the rule of law, and political pluralism. Niger and Gabon have not made progress in protecting political pluralism and the rule of law. Uganda has also violated human rights. Despite engagement with the United States, these countries have failed to address concerns about their non-compliance. The termination will be effective from January 1, 2024, and the eligibility of these countries will continue to be assessed.
