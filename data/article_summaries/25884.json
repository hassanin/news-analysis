This presidential memorandum, issued on April 10, 2020, addresses visa sanctions in relation to the ongoing pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The memorandum emphasizes the importance of cooperation between the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to effectively implement sanctions provided by section 243(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). It states that countries that deny or unreasonably delay the acceptance of their citizens, subjects, nationals, or residents from the United States during the pandemic create public health risks. The Secretary of Homeland Security is directed to notify the Secretary of State if any foreign government denies or unreasonably delays accepting aliens from that country, and if such action impedes the Department of Homeland Security's operations in responding to the pandemic. Upon receiving such notification, the Secretary of State must adopt and initiate a plan to impose visa sanctions, as provided for in section 243(d) of the INA. These sanctions will cease to apply if the Secretary of Homeland Security notifies the Secretary of State that the foreign country has resumed accepting aliens without unreasonable delay. The memorandum also includes general provisions, stating that it does not impair the authority of executive departments or agencies, and that it shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. It further clarifies that the memorandum does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities, and it will cease to apply on December 31, 2020, unless extended.
