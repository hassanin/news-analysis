The White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, talked about the latest job numbers, stating that the US has been creating jobs for 44 consecutive months, with a total of 7.8 million jobs created. However, he also mentioned that the government shutdown and debt limit brinksmanship had a negative impact on the economy, resulting in an uptick in unemployment.

He also discussed the ongoing talks with Iran, stating that there is no deal yet and that the US and Israel are in complete agreement about preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Earnest mentioned that the President is open to working with Congress to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and address any gaps or flaws. He also talked about the President's goal of doubling exports and his support for increasing the minimum wage. In terms of the schedule, Earnest mentioned that the President did not have any public events scheduled for the next day but would be participating in a breakfast for veterans on Veterans Day.
