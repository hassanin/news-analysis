President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has published a notice stating that the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans, which was declared in Executive Order 13219 on June 26, 2001, will continue beyond June 26, 2021. The threat posed by extremist violence in the former Republic of Macedonia and the Western Balkans region, as well as acts obstructing the implementation of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 in Kosovo, has not been resolved. These actions are considered hostile to U.S. interests and continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to national security and foreign policy. Therefore, President Biden has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
