First Lady Michelle Obama announced commitments from major retailers, foundations, and small businesses to provide access to healthy, affordable food to millions of people in underserved communities. The commitments include opening or expanding over 1,500 stores to serve communities that currently lack access to fresh produce and other healthy foods. The stores estimate that they will create tens of thousands of jobs and serve approximately 9.5 million people in these communities. Currently, 23.5 million Americans, including 6.5 million children, live in low-income areas without access to affordable and healthy foods. Limited access to healthy food choices can lead to poor diets, higher levels of obesity, and other diet-related diseases. The commitments aim to give parents real choices about the food their kids are eating and to solve the problem of childhood obesity within a generation.
