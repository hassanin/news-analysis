The President of the United States, at a meeting with the Dalai Lama, expressed his support for the preservation of Tibetan traditions and the protection of human rights for Tibetans in China. He commended the Dalai Lama's commitment to nonviolence and dialogue with China. The U.S. policy remains that Tibet is part of China, but the President encouraged direct dialogue between Tibet and China to resolve their differences. The Dalai Lama stated that he is not seeking independence for Tibet and hopes that dialogue between his representatives and the Chinese government can resume soon.
