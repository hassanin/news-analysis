President Barack Obama will award Staff Sergeant Salvatore Giunta, U.S. Army, the Medal of Honor for his courageous actions during combat operations in the Korengal Valley, Afghanistan in October 2007. Giunta's wife and parents will join the President at the White House for the ceremony. Giunta enlisted in the Army in 2003 and has completed two combat tours in Afghanistan. He has received several military decorations, including the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who display gallantry above and beyond the call of duty in combat situations. The individual must show great personal bravery or self-sacrifice that distinguishes them from their comrades and involves a risk to their life.
