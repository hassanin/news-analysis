President Joseph R. Biden has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to the situation in Mali, which was declared in Executive Order 13882 on July 26, 2019, will continue beyond July 26, 2022. The reasons for this decision include repeated violations of ceasefire arrangements, the expansion of terrorist activities, drug trafficking, human rights abuses, hostage-taking, a coup d'etat, the presence of foreign mercenaries, and intensified attacks against civilians, the Malian defense and security forces, and international security presences. President Biden has determined that these factors pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
