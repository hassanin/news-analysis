President Obama has declared a major disaster in West Virginia due to severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides that began on June 22, 2016. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in the counties of Greenbrier, Kanawha, and Nicholas. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for emergency protective measures and hazard mitigation measures. Damage surveys are ongoing in other areas, and more counties and forms of assistance may be designated after assessments are complete. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week until further notice. For more information, contact FEMA.
