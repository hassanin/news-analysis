In a press briefing, senior administration officials announced that President Trump will issue a statement explaining his decision to waive the nuclear sanctions required by the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), but that this will be the last waiver he will issue. The President intends to work with European partners on a follow-on agreement that includes triggers related to ballistic missiles, nuclear breakout period, and inspections, and has no sunset clause. The officials emphasized that this agreement would not entail direct negotiations with Iran, but rather be an agreement amongst the United States and European partners to re-impose multilateral sanctions if Iran surpasses the agreed-upon triggers. The Treasury Department also announced 14 new designations of Iranian entities and individuals in connection with human rights abuses, censorship, and support to Iranian weapons proliferators. The officials stated that these actions are part of the administration's broader efforts to counter Iran's reckless and destabilizing behavior. They also highlighted that the President still hopes for an amendment to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act that addresses issues such as inspections, breakout timeline, sunset flaw, and missile programs. One of the designations announced, that of Sadegh Larijani, the head of Iran's judiciary, is expected to have a serious political impact in Iran.
