First Lady Michelle Obama has partnered with Sesame Workshop and the Produce Marketing Association (PMA) to promote fresh fruit and vegetable consumption to children. This two-year agreement allows PMA's community of growers, suppliers, and retailers to use Sesame Street characters to deliver messages about healthy food choices without a licensing fee. The partnership aims to make it easier for busy parents and families to make healthy choices. The announcement follows a White House convening on food marketing to children, where Mrs. Obama called for leveraging marketing to promote healthy products and reduce the marketing of unhealthy products to kids. The First Lady referenced a study that showed children were more likely to choose apples over cookies when Elmo stickers were placed on the apples. This collaboration aims to get children excited about eating fruits and vegetables by utilizing the influence and trust of Sesame Street characters.
