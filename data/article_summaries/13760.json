President Barack Obama has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660, which addresses the actions and policies of individuals undermining democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine, will continue beyond March 6, 2016. The actions and policies of the Russian Federation, including the annexation of Crimea and the use of force in Ukraine, continue to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Obama has determined that it is necessary to extend the national emergency with respect to Ukraine.
