President Biden has announced that the United States will purchase and donate 500 million Pfizer vaccines to low- and lower middle-income countries and the African Union. This is the largest-ever purchase and donation of vaccines by a single country. The goal is to save lives and end the pandemic globally. The vaccines will start shipping in August 2021, with 200 million doses to be delivered by the end of this year and the remaining 300 million in the first half of 2022. The donation will provide mRNA vaccines that have proven to be highly effective against COVID-19, including all known variants. Pfizer will produce these doses in the U.S., utilizing their facilities and American workers. This is part of a coordinated effort by the world's democracies to vaccinate people worldwide.
