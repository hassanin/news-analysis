This article is a notice from the White House stating that the national emergency with respect to Libya, which was declared in 2011, will continue for another year. The national emergency was initially declared due to the threat posed by Colonel Muammar Qadhafi and his government, who used extreme measures against the people of Libya. The declaration aimed to protect against the misappropriation of Libyan state assets by Qadhafi and his associates. The White House believes that the situation in Libya still poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and measures need to be taken to prevent the diversion of assets by certain individuals.
