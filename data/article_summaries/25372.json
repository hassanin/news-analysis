President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump have announced the special guests who will be seated with the First Lady during the President's first State of the Union Address. The guests include Fred and Cindy Warmbier, whose son Otto was detained in North Korea and tragically passed away after being released. The Warmbiers are suing North Korea for wrongful death. Another guest is Ji Seong-ho, a North Korean defector who lost his left hand and foot in a train accident and now works to broadcast information into North Korea and help resettlement of defectors in South Korea. Ji recently gave theatrical performances in the United States to raise awareness about the abuses faced by street children in North Korea.
