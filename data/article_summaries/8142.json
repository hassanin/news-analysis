The article highlights the fiscal hypocrisy of Congressional Republicans, who claim that reducing the national debt is a top priority but have proposed legislation that would increase the debt by over $3 trillion. The author criticizes their focus on tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations, which have historically failed to deliver economic benefits. The article also discusses specific bills and proposals by Congressional Republicans that would add to the debt, such as repealing legislation cracking down on tax evasion by the wealthy, repealing prescription drug cost reforms, enriching large corporations, repealing taxes on stock buybacks, and extending President Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy. The article argues that these proposals would ultimately lead to tax increases for middle-class and working families, and calls for transparency from Congressional Republicans on who will bear the cost of their policies.
