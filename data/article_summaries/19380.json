This press gaggle by Press Secretary Josh Earnest aboard Air Force One discusses President Obama's visit to Nashville to talk about immigration reform. The press also asks questions about the release of the Senate report on CIA torture techniques, and whether anyone should be held accountable for those actions. Earnest emphasizes the importance of being transparent about any shortcomings and improving procedures to strengthen national security. He also expresses support for the men and women in the intelligence community. The press asks about the accuracy of the report and whether the President believes the techniques used were crimes. Earnest defers to the Department of Justice for any legal determinations and reiterates the President's belief that the techniques were wrong and that torture is inconsistent with American values. The press also asks about other topics such as a tax bill and the possibility of a partial budget for the Department of Homeland Security. Earnest says the President's view is that Congress should pass a full-year budget for the full federal government.
