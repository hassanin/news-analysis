On World Water Day, the Biden-Harris Administration emphasizes the importance of water and commits to pursuing a water-secure world. They recognize the critical role of sustainable and resilient water systems and the transformative power of safe and accessible water in people's lives. Global water security is seen as integral to national security objectives and foreign policy investments, with the goal of improving global health, prosperity, stability, and resilience through sustainable water resource management and access to safe drinking water, sanitation services, and hygiene practices. The United States will unveil commitments of up to $49 billion at the UN Water Conference to support equitable access, climate-resilient water and sanitation infrastructure, both domestically and globally. They will leverage domestic investments and programs to enhance their work abroad. Through historic investments in infrastructure and technology, the U.S. government aims to help Americans withstand stronger storms and longer droughts. They will also use available tools and resources to implement the Global Water Strategy and accelerate financing for adaptation measures in developing countries through the President's Emergency Plan of Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE). The U.S. government will collaborate with G7+ partners to mobilize public and private capital for climate-resilient infrastructure in low- and middle-income countries, supporting inclusive and sustainable development. The administration is hopeful about the increasing number of countries prioritizing water security and pledges to work with partners and allies to achieve water security for all.
