The article is a message from President Barack Obama to Congress regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Iran. The National Emergencies Act states that a national emergency automatically terminates unless the President publishes a notice stating that it is to continue beyond the anniversary date. President Obama has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12170 due to the fact that relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal and the process of implementing agreements with Iran is still ongoing.
