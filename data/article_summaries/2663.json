President Biden and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo have announced the designation of 31 communities across the country as Regional Innovation and Technology Hubs (Tech Hubs). These Tech Hubs will focus on developing and growing innovative industries such as semiconductors, clean energy, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and more. The Tech Hubs program, authorized by the CHIPS and Science Act, aims to catalyze investment in critical technologies and make transformative investments in innovation, supply chain resilience, and job creation.

President Biden's Investing in America agenda has used strategic public investments to attract private sector funding in key areas driving American competitiveness. Private companies have announced over half a trillion dollars in clean energy and manufacturing investments since Biden took office. These investments, including semiconductor manufacturing, electric vehicle and battery manufacturing, and biomanufacturing, align with the industries represented by the Tech Hubs.

The Tech Hubs aim to bring the benefits of scientific and technological innovation to communities across the country, with a focus on benefiting small and rural areas as well as historically underserved communities. The selected Tech Hubs represent the diversity of America and include workforce organizations like labor unions to create good-paying, union jobs.

In addition to the 31 Tech Hubs, the Department of Commerce is awarding 18 coalitions Strategy Development Grants to build economic development plans for future rounds of the Tech Hub program.

To support the Tech Hubs, the Administration is bringing the full resources of the federal government to provide funding, technical assistance, and planning for the 31 coalitions. The goal is to ensure that these Tech Hubs have the tools they need to compete on a global scale.
