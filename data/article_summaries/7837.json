In this article, President Biden is asked various questions regarding classified documents, the US-China relations, the balloon spotted over Colombia and Costa Rica, Kamala Harris' performance at the border, the decision to shoot down the Chinese spy balloon, his State of the Union address, sending F-16s to Ukraine, the risk of a recession, banning TikTok, and trusting China's official COVID count. President Biden responds to these questions, stating that he does not take blame for mishandling classified documents, the balloon does not weaken US-China relations, Kamala Harris is doing a good job, the decision to shoot down the balloon was always his position, the balloon incident does not change his speech or foreign policy message, the Chinese government committed a brazen act, he wants to inform the American people about the state of affairs in his State of the Union address, he is against sending F-16s to Ukraine, the risk of a recession is still low but caution is needed, he is unsure about banning TikTok, and the question of trusting China depends on working together and identifying areas of opposition.
