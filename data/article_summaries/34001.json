The Trump administration believes that its policies have led to a stronger economy, which has encouraged more Americans to reenter the job market. However, the administration believes that welfare programs are not doing enough to promote work and self-sufficiency. In April, President Trump signed an executive order instructing agencies to encourage work in welfare programs whenever possible. A report from the President's Council of Economic Advisers highlights the potential benefits of these efforts, citing the success of welfare reforms in the 1990s. The report also states that many Medicaid and food stamps recipients are of working age and not disabled, but the majority of them do not work. The administration argues that work is the best way to escape poverty and that jobs are currently available in the strong economy.
