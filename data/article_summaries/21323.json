The White House issued a declaration on climate change and clean energy on August 10, 2009. The leaders of North America emphasized the importance of taking aggressive action on climate change and recognized the goal of reducing global emissions by at least 50% compared to 1990 levels by 2050. They also expressed a vision for a low-carbon North America and agreed to work together to set and implement ambitious emissions reduction goals. The declaration outlined various areas of collaboration, including the development of low-carbon growth plans, strengthening financial instruments for mitigation and adaptation actions, cooperation in climate change adaptation, developing approaches to measuring and reporting emissions reductions, building capacity for future cooperation in emissions trading systems, and collaboration on climate-friendly technologies. The leaders also committed to working on reducing emissions in key sectors such as transportation, managing landscapes for greenhouse gas benefits, aligning energy efficiency standards, and reducing emissions in the oil and gas sector. They agreed to develop a Trilateral Working Plan and submit a report of results at the next North American Leaders Summit in 2010.
