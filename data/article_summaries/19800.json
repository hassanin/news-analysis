President Obama has released the Administration's National Drug Control Strategy, which aims to reduce drug use and its consequences through a balanced approach of prevention, treatment, enforcement, and international cooperation. The strategy highlights community-based prevention, integration of evidence-based treatment, innovations in the criminal justice system, and international partnerships. The goals of the strategy include reducing youth drug use, decreasing drug use among young adults, reducing chronic drug users, reducing drug-induced deaths, and reducing drugged driving. The strategy also focuses on addressing prescription drug abuse, drugged driving, and preventing drug use. It emphasizes a research-driven, evidence-based, and collaborative approach, as well as expanding community addiction centers and developing new medications and treatments for addiction. The strategy also supports law enforcement, criminal justice, and community-based programs like drug courts.
