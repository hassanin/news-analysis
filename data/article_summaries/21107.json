This article is about an executive order issued by President Barack Obama in November 2016. The order establishes a Community Solutions Council, which aims to address challenges faced by communities in the United States. The council is tasked with coordinating efforts across federal agencies and engaging with communities to deliver improved outcomes. It is led by two co-chairs, one of whom is an Assistant to the President or the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, while the other is rotated every four years from among the heads of various departments. The council consists of members from different government agencies and organizations. Its mission includes fostering collaboration, using evidence-based practices, and investing in talent to deliver effective services to communities. The executive order supersedes two previous orders and builds upon existing efforts and initiatives to support communities.
