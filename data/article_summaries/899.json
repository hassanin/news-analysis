The United States has designated the Houthi militants in Yemen, also known as Ansarallah, as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist in response to their attacks on US military forces and international maritime vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. This designation aims to impede terrorist funding to the Houthis and restrict their access to financial markets. However, if the Houthis cease their attacks, the designation will be reevaluated. The US is implementing humanitarian carve outs and licenses to ensure that the Yemeni people are not negatively impacted by the sanctions. Commercial shipments into Yemeni ports, particularly those carrying food, medicine, and fuel, will not be affected by the sanctions. The US is determined to protect its people and maintain the free flow of international commerce.
