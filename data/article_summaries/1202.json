The Biden-Harris Administration has released new data showing the impact of President Biden's prescription drug law on lowering healthcare costs and prescription drug prices for seniors. The Inflation Reduction Act allows Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices, caps the cost of insulin at $35, provides free recommended vaccines for Medicare beneficiaries, and requires prescription drug companies to pay rebates to Medicare if they raise prices faster than inflation. Already, millions of seniors are saving hundreds of dollars each per year due to these actions. The administration is also working to expand these cost savings to all Americans, with proposals to increase Medicare's negotiation authority, make manufacturers pay rebates for raising drug prices faster than inflation, and cap the price of insulin at $35 per month for everyone. New data shows that 3.4 million people with Medicare could have saved $234 million in out-of-pocket costs in 2021 if the Inflation Reduction Act had been in effect, and 1.5 million seniors with diabetes could have saved $500 each per year on insulin. The Department of Health and Human Services has also announced the first set of prescription drugs subject to inflation rebates, which will lower coinsurance costs for some Medicare beneficiaries starting in April. In addition, the administration will release initial guidance on Medicare's drug price negotiation process, which aims to further lower drug prices for beneficiaries.
