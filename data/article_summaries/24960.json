The United States is deeply concerned about reports of a chemical weapons attack in Syria that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of civilians. They strongly condemn the use of chemical weapons and believe those responsible should be held accountable. The US is requesting that the United Nations investigate this allegation and is urging the Syrian government to provide immediate and unfettered access to the UN investigative team. The US has also called for urgent consultations in the UN Security Council to discuss the allegations and to demand access for the investigative team. They are urging all parties in Syria to provide access to important investigation sites and ensure the security of the UN team.
