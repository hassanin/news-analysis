The Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH) celebrates African American History Month in February, which was made official by Presidential designation in 1976. This year's theme is "African Americans in Times of War," commemorating the 100th anniversary of the World War I armistice. President Trump's proclamation highlights the military service of African Americans throughout American history, despite facing racial prejudice and discrimination. Vice President Mike Pence visited the National Museum of African American History and Culture, while President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump hosted a reception honoring African American leaders. The ASALH was founded in 1915 to address the lack of historical information about African Americans. Throughout February, celebrations and educational initiatives will take place across the country to recognize the essential role of African Americans in U.S. history.
