On March 31, 2016, President Barack Obama issued a proclamation declaring it as César Chávez Day. The proclamation honors César Chávez, a labor leader and civil rights activist who fought for the rights of farm workers and advocated for a more just and equal society. Chávez's legacy is celebrated for his efforts to expand opportunities for workers, promote a living wage, and advocate for workers' rights to unionize. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to observe the day with service, community, and education programs to honor Chávez's enduring legacy.
