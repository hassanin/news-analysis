The article is a statement by the President announcing the US-Korea Trade Agreement. The President is pleased with the agreement, stating that it is expected to increase annual exports of American goods by up to $11 billion and support at least 70,000 American jobs. The agreement provides American manufacturers with more access to the Korean market and a level playing field. It also opens Korea's services market to American companies and includes high standards for the protection of worker's rights and the environment. The President sees this agreement as an integral part of his Administration's efforts to open foreign markets, create jobs, and achieve the goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years. The agreement strengthens the alliance between the United States and South Korea and reinforces American leadership in the Asia Pacific. The President looks forward to working with Congress and leaders from both parties to ensure its implementation and to compete aggressively in the 21st-century job market.
