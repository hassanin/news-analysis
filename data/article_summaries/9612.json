The White House held a conference call to discuss the section of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that relates to Iran sanctions. The call was to provide background information on the sanctions and the President's determination to go forward with them. The NDAA included provisions for sanctions against the Central Bank of Iran, with the first set of sanctions already in effect and the second set to take effect on June 28th. The President signed the determination to activate the second set of sanctions, which target oil-related transactions with the Central Bank of Iran. The administration has been working with international partners to implement these sanctions in a responsible way, issuing exemptions to countries that have cooperated in reducing their purchases of Iranian crude oil. The call also addressed questions about the impact of the sanctions on global oil prices, the significance of exemptions for countries like India and China, and the role of strategic reserves in managing oil supply.
