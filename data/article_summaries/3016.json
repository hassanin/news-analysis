In this article, President Joe Biden addresses the January 6th hearings, describing the insurrection as a dark chapter in US history and emphasizing the need to protect democracy. He then discusses his top economic priority, which is fighting inflation. He acknowledges that Americans are anxious about rising prices, particularly for gas and food, and highlights the unique strengths of the US economy. Despite inflation, the job market is strong, unemployment rates are low, and families have less debt and more savings. The Biden administration is committed to lowering prices for the American people, and Congress is taking action to address the issue. One key approach is to lower the cost of moving goods through the supply chain, with a focus on improving ports and trucking. The President also criticizes foreign-owned shipping companies for raising prices and calls on Congress to crack down on them. He discusses other ways to reduce costs for families, such as lowering prescription drug costs and high-speed internet bills. President Biden contrasts his approach with that of congressional Republicans, whom he accuses of wanting to raise taxes on working families and eliminate healthcare programs like the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid. He emphasizes the need to work together to find common ground and build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. The President concludes by calling out Exxon for its profits and lack of investment.
