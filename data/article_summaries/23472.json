In this memorandum, President Barack Obama approves the provision of aviation insurance coverage for commercial air carrier service in domestic and international operations. He determines that this is necessary for the interest of air commerce, national security, and the foreign policy of the United States. The Secretary of Transportation is directed to provide insurance or reinsurance to U.S. air carriers against loss or damage arising from the operation of an aircraft until September 30, 2012, or until such insurance or reinsurance cannot be obtained on reasonable terms and conditions from any company authorized to conduct insurance business in a State of the United States. The determination is to be brought to the attention of all air carriers and published in the Federal Register.
