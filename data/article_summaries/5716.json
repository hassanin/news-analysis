President Biden is launching a coordinated effort to address extreme heat and its impact on the lives and livelihoods of Americans. Extreme heat is a leading weather-related killer in the United States, and the climate crisis is making heatwaves more intense and frequent. Millions of workers, especially Black and Brown workers, are exposed to heat in their workplaces, and vulnerable groups such as children, seniors, and economically disadvantaged individuals are at higher risk. To protect workers and communities, the Biden Administration is taking immediate action, including developing workplace heat standards and increasing enforcement. They are also providing cooling assistance to households and communities without access to air conditioning and launching an innovation challenge to protect people at risk of heat-related illness or death. The administration is also addressing disproportionate heat impacts on disadvantaged communities and working to improve local preparedness through data sharing and technical assistance. President Biden is calling on Congress to deliver investments in resilience to support communities and mitigate climate-related impacts, including extreme heat.
