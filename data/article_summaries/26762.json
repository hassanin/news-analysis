Each year, Men's Health Week is observed leading up to Father's Day, encouraging fathers, brothers, and sons to prioritize their health. Despite advances in technology and healthcare, men still face distinctive health issues, with a shorter life expectancy compared to women. Many men visit healthcare providers less frequently and suffer from cardiovascular disease. The current healthcare system is failing both men and women, with limited choices, high premiums, and out-of-pocket costs. Expanding education, awareness, and choice in healthcare is crucial to improving healthcare outcomes for men.
