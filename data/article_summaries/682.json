The article is a memorandum from President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to the Secretary of Defense. The memorandum prescribes a method for designating a member of the Military Sentencing Parameters and Criteria Board. It states that if the chief trial judges designated under article 26(g) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice do not include a trial judge of the Navy, then the Judge Advocate General of the Navy will designate either the Chief Judge of the Department of the Navy or a Navy trial judge assigned to the Navy and Marine Corps Trial Judiciary as a voting member of the Board. Similarly, if the chief trial judges do not include a trial judge of the Marine Corps, then the Staff Judge Advocate to the Commandant of the Marine Corps, in consultation with the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, will designate a Marine Corps trial judge assigned to the Navy and Marine Corps Trial Judiciary as a voting member of the Board. The memorandum also states that it constitutes the regulations provided for in subsections (ii) and (iii) of section 539E(e)(4)(B) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022, and it authorizes the publication of the memorandum in the Federal Register.
