The Equal Futures Partnership, launched by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on behalf of the United States, aims to promote women's political and economic empowerment. The partnership consists of 12 founding members, including Australia, Benin, Bangladesh, Denmark, Finland, Indonesia, Jordan, the Netherlands, Peru, Senegal, Tunisia, and the European Union. The goal is for women to participate fully in public life and benefit from inclusive economic growth. The founding members have committed to taking actions such as legal, regulatory, and policy reforms to advance this goal. The United States is making commitments in areas such as STEM education and careers for women, promoting civic education and public leadership for girls, ensuring economic security for survivors of violence, and supporting women entrepreneurs. Several leading US businesses, academic institutions, and non-profit organizations have also made commitments to advance women and girls' empowerment. The founding partners will continue consultations with their national stakeholders to translate commitments into action and reconvene in April 2013 to share progress reports and welcome new member countries.
