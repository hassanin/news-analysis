President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation recognizing the 70th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge. He highlights the significance of this battle during World War II, where American and Allied forces fought against German forces in Belgium and Luxembourg. Despite being heavily outnumbered, the Allied forces achieved a crucial victory, marking the turning point in the war. The Battle of the Bulge was one of the largest and bloodiest encounters for the United States during the war, with over 76,000 American service members killed, wounded, or missing in action. The proclamation calls on Americans to honor the sacrifice of this generation and to remember the heroes who fought for freedom and liberty. President Obama encourages appropriate ceremonies and activities to commemorate this solemn day of remembrance.
