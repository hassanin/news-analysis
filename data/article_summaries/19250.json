The United States has announced a National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking, aimed at addressing the serious and urgent threat posed by illegal trade in wildlife. As part of this strategy, the US has also implemented a ban on the commercial trade of elephant ivory. The ban prohibits the import, export, or resale of elephant ivory within the United States, with a few exceptions. The National Strategy focuses on three priorities: strengthening enforcement, reducing demand for illegal wildlife products, and building partnerships to combat wildlife poaching and trade. The ban on elephant ivory includes prohibitions on commercial imports and exports, as well as restrictions on domestic sales. The definition of "antique" is clarified, and protections for African elephants under the Endangered Species Act are restored. Additionally, the US will limit the number of African elephant sport-hunted trophies that can be imported. The US aims to lead global efforts in protecting iconic species and preserving the planet's natural beauty. The hope is that other countries will join in taking ambitious action against wildlife trafficking, and further steps will be taken to implement the National Strategy and strengthen existing laws.
