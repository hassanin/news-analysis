First Lady Melania Trump delivered remarks on May 8, 2018, at a luncheon where she introduced her formal platform called "BE BEST." The campaign aims to educate children about the issues they face today and help them grow up to be happy, healthy, and morally responsible adults. The three major areas of focus are physical and emotional well-being, social media use, and opioid abuse. Melania plans to speak directly with children about their victories and challenges and highlight individuals, organizations, and programs that are making a difference in children's lives. She mentioned Preston Sharp, a young man who created a nonprofit called "Preston's Veteran Flowers and Flags" to honor fallen veterans. Melania also encouraged others to join her in working for the betterment of children and asked for information about programs in different states and territories. She concluded her remarks by thanking everyone and expressing her hope for positive change for children.
