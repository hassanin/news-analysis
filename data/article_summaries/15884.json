This article is a notice from the White House regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Yemen. The national emergency was declared on May 16, 2012, due to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Yemen and others that threatened Yemen's peace, security, and stability. These actions included obstructing the implementation of a peaceful transition of power and obstructing the political process in Yemen. The national emergency is being continued for another year, as the threat to national security and foreign policy of the United States remains.
