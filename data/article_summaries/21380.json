On March 4, 1913, President William Howard Taft established the United States Department of Labor, an agency aimed at promoting the welfare of American workers and ensuring fair wages and protections. Over the past century, the Department has fought for worker rights, including the 40-hour work week, minimum wage, family leave, and pensions. It has also worked to break down barriers to equal opportunity in the workplace and improve worker safety and health. Currently, the Department is focused on providing workers with the skills and training they need for the 21st century job market. President Barack Obama proclaimed March 4, 2013, as the 100th Anniversary of the United States Department of Labor, calling upon Americans to recognize the Department's contributions to workplace dignity and our way of life.
