The White House and U.S. Department of Treasury are hosting a White House Summit on Building Lasting Eviction Prevention Reform. The summit will focus on the need for lasting reform in eviction prevention, utilizing remaining American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds. The goal is to prevent a return to an eviction system that allowed 3.6 million eviction filings a year without legal representation or eviction diversion options. The summit will feature top administration officials, as well as state and local leaders who have implemented successful eviction prevention approaches. The summit will also highlight the overall progress of the Emergency Rental Assistance Program and showcase top models of reform at the state and local court and government levels.
