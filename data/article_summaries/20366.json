President Barack Obama has declared December 2014 as National Impaired Driving Prevention Month in an effort to raise awareness about the dangers of drunk, drugged, and distracted driving. Impaired driving not only puts the driver at risk, but also threatens the lives of passengers and other individuals on the road. The President emphasizes that impaired driving is preventable and unacceptable, and the administration is taking action to reduce and eliminate it. The government is supporting law enforcement officers and promoting campaigns such as Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over to remind Americans of their responsibility to drive safely. The proclamation also highlights the problem of drugged driving, emphasizing that illegal drugs, as well as prescription and over-the-counter medications, can be just as deadly as alcohol. The government is working to collect data, strengthen protections against drugged driving, and enhance law enforcement officials' ability to identify drug-impaired drivers. The proclamation calls on parents and adults to educate young Americans about the dangers of impaired driving and to model good driving practices. It also encourages individuals to designate a sober driver or make alternative transportation arrangements during the holiday season. The President urges all Americans to make responsible decisions and take appropriate measures to prevent impaired driving.
