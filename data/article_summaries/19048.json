President Obama has signed an executive order to improve federal programs by leveraging research insights from behavioral science. The White House is announcing new actions to make government programs more effective and efficient by understanding how people engage with and respond to them. The report from the Social and Behavioral Sciences Team highlights the projects they have worked on in their first year, which have made government programs more accessible and user-friendly. As a result, more servicemembers are saving for retirement, more students are going to college, more veterans are accessing their benefits, more farmers are obtaining credit, and more families are gaining healthcare coverage. The executive order directs federal agencies to use behavioral science insights to improve program outcomes in four areas: streamlining access to programs, improving the presentation of information, structuring choices carefully, and considering a full range of incentives. The order also establishes the Social and Behavioral Sciences Team as a group of experts that will provide advice and policy guidance to federal agencies. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs and the Office of Science and Technology Policy are issuing guidance on how agencies can use behavioral science insights to make government forms simpler and easier to complete. The report also highlights new projects and collaborations that aim to improve retirement security, expand access to higher education, improve economic opportunity, improve health outcomes, address energy and environment-related challenges, and improve government program integrity and compliance.
