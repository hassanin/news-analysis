The United States has been providing support for peacekeeping efforts in Africa since 2009. They have committed nearly $892 million to develop African peacekeeping capacity and have trained and equipped over a quarter-million African troops and police for service in UN and AU peacekeeping operations. The U.S. announced the African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership (APRRP) which will invest $110 million per year for 3-5 years to build the capacity of African militaries to rapidly deploy peacekeepers in response to emerging conflicts. They will partner with six countries to develop a rapid response capability program. The U.S. has also provided training and equipment to African police prior to their deployment to UN peacekeeping operations. They are committed to strengthening the AU's institutional capacity to launch and support peacekeeping operations and increasing interoperability among AU states during peacekeeping deployments. The U.S. is the largest financial contributor to UN peacekeeping operations and has provided support to AU-led efforts in countries such as the Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Mali, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan-Darfur/Abyei.
