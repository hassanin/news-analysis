President Obama has declared a major disaster in South Dakota due to a severe winter storm and snowstorm that occurred in April 2013. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and snow assistance. Hazard mitigation measures will also be funded. Gary R. Stanley has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
