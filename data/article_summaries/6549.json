The article discusses the passing of the bipartisan Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act by Congress, in response to President Biden's call to strengthen healthcare and benefits for veterans and their survivors. The PACT Act is considered the most significant expansion of benefits and services for toxic exposed veterans in over 30 years. President Biden believes in the sacred obligation to care for veterans and their families, especially when they face increased health risks as a result of their military service. The PACT Act aims to address toxic exposures that have impacted veterans, their families, and caregivers, and provide them with the healthcare and benefits they deserve. It supports President Biden's commitment to supporting veterans and his Cancer Moonshot initiative. The legislation is named after Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson, a decorated combat medic who passed away from lung cancer related to toxic exposures. The PACT Act will deliver more timely benefits and services to over 5 million veterans who may have been impacted by toxic exposures while serving the country. This legislation builds on the Biden-Harris Administration's existing efforts to address the harmful effects of environmental exposures affecting service members.
