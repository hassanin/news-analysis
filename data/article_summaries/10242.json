In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims October 2015 as National Youth Justice Awareness Month. The President emphasizes the importance of preventing young people from entering the juvenile and criminal justice systems, as involvement in these systems can have long-lasting negative effects on their futures. He highlights the disproportionate number of young people of color who are detained or incarcerated, as well as the high cost of holding young people in state-operated facilities. The President discusses the efforts of his administration to implement reforms that reduce recidivism and improve youth outcomes, such as the Smart on Juvenile Justice initiative and the My Brother's Keeper initiative. He calls on all Americans to observe this month by participating in community efforts to support youth and by engaging in appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
