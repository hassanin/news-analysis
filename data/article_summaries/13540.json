President Obama supports giving states the power and flexibility to find their own health care solutions. Starting in 2014, states will be able to apply for State Innovation Waivers, which will allow them to implement their own strategies to ensure access to affordable health insurance. These strategies must provide coverage to at least as many residents as the Affordable Care Act and not increase the federal deficit. The Empowering States to Innovate Act proposes making these waivers available three years earlier than current law. State Innovation Waivers are provided for up to five years and must meet certain criteria, or the policies in the Affordable Care Act will take effect. The law also allows states to propose alternative ways to meet the goals of making health insurance affordable and accessible. The Affordable Care Act already provides states with flexibility and resources to implement reform. It has also made funds available to states and every state has taken steps to improve health insurance accountability and affordability. The law also includes important consumer protections, such as preventing insurance companies from imposing lifetime limits or denying coverage because of pre-existing conditions. The Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Treasury are responsible for evaluating State Innovation Waiver applications and ensuring they meet the goals of the Affordable Care Act. The President will issue a memorandum directing Executive Departments and Agencies to work with state, tribal, and local governments to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens and focus resources on achieving better outcomes at lower costs.
