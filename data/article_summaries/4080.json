This article is a proclamation by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. regarding the imposition of tariffs on aluminum articles imported from Russia. The Secretary of Commerce previously found that imports of aluminum articles were threatening the national security of the United States. In response, the President decided to impose a 10 percent ad valorem tariff on aluminum articles imported from most countries. However, the Secretary has informed the President that the domestic aluminum industry is still struggling, with two smelters in danger of closing due to high levels of imports and energy prices. The Secretary also recommended applying a higher tariff specifically to aluminum imports from Russia. The article highlights that Russia is a major exporter of aluminum to the United States, and while imports from Russia have decreased since 2018, they have increased in 2021 and 2022. The article also mentions that Russia's aluminum industry is a key part of its defense industrial base and has played a role in supplying weapons and ammunition for the war against Ukraine. The President has determined that it is necessary to impose a 200 percent ad valorem tariff on aluminum articles and derivative aluminum articles from Russia, as well as on articles where primary aluminum used in the manufacturing process is smelted or cast in Russia. The proclamation also emphasizes the need to work with partner countries to address the global market distortions caused by Russian aluminum imports. The modifications and tariffs outlined in the proclamation will be effective from specific dates and will continue unless modified or terminated.
