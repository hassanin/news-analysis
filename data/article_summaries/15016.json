Carney stated that the US is considering further sanctions against Russia and is coordinating closely with European partners on this matter. He also mentioned that the US is evaluating what actions Russia has taken and will take appropriate action in response. Carney confirmed that CIA Director John Brennan was in Ukraine over the weekend, but did not provide further details. He also mentioned that the US is supportive of Ukraine's efforts to stabilize the situation, including the deployment of counterterrorism forces to the east.
