The Rehabilitation Act, enacted 50 years ago, is a significant civil rights law that prohibited discrimination based on disability by federally funded entities. It laid the groundwork for the Americans with Disabilities Act. The writer, as a Senator, co-sponsored this legislation and has since been dedicated to ensuring equal opportunities for the one in four Americans with disabilities. Efforts have been made to advance opportunities for people with disabilities in the Federal workforce and to help State and local governments, employers, and nonprofits hire more disabled Americans. However, there is still work to be done as disabled Americans are less likely to have a job and often earn less for the same work. Voting locations, transit, and public spaces also remain inaccessible. The writer's administration is committed to equal access for all and acknowledges the tireless advocacy of individuals with disabilities in the passage of this law and others. They will continue to work towards breaking down barriers for those facing discrimination.
