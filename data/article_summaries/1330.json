President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed September 2023 as National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month in the United States. Ovarian cancer is the deadliest of all female reproductive system cancers, and nearly 20,000 women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with it this year. The lack of reliable methods for asymptomatic screening and detection often leads to late-stage diagnoses. The high cost of life-saving care, including ovarian cancer drugs, also poses a financial burden for patients. The Biden administration is committed to changing this by investing in scientific breakthroughs and making healthcare more affordable. Early detection is crucial for improving survival rates, and women are encouraged to discuss risk factors with their doctors. The proclamation calls for increased awareness and support for ovarian cancer patients, their families, and the medical community.
