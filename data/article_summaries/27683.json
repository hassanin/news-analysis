During a meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu discussed their strong relationship and their support for each other. They also discussed the decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, which they believe pushes peace forward by recognizing history and the present reality. Netanyahu expressed his appreciation for Trump's stance on the Iran nuclear deal and his support against Iran's aggression. Trump mentioned the United Nations' lack of support for the U.S. and Israel, and he emphasized that respect needs to be shown to the U.S. for any progress in the peace process. Trump also mentioned that the U.S. has a proposal for peace between Israel and Palestine, but the toughest issue of Jerusalem has been taken off the table. He hopes that both sides will want to make peace and that it will be a great achievement. Trump also mentioned that the money the U.S. provides to Palestine is on the table and will only continue if progress is made towards peace.
