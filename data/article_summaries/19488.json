Helen Thomas, a pioneering journalist who covered every White House since President Kennedy's, has passed away. She broke down barriers for women in journalism and was known for keeping presidents on their toes with tough questions. Her belief in holding leaders accountable made her the "Dean of the White House Press Corps." President Obama and First Lady Michelle expressed their sadness and offered condolences to Helen's family, friends, and colleagues.
