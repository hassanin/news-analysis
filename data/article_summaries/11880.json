President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Missouri and ordered federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred in September 2014. The declaration makes federal funding available to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, to help with emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The affected counties include Adair, Andrew, Atchison, Daviess, Gentry, Grundy, Harrison, Holt, Knox, Lewis, Linn, Livingston, Macon, Mercer, Nodaway, Putnam, Ralls, Shelby, Sullivan, and Worth. Federal funding is also available for hazard mitigation measures throughout the state. Laura S. Hevesi has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
