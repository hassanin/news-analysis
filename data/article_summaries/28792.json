The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has been successful in reducing the use of opioids and managing pain among veterans through its Opioid Safety Initiative. Severe pain is more common among veterans compared to non-veterans, and many veterans suffer from chronic pain for the rest of their lives. The initiative has resulted in a 45% reduction in veteran patients receiving opioids since its launch. It has also reduced the number of veterans on long-term and high-dose opioid therapy. The program focuses on educating pharmacists and prescribers to identify the best treatment for each veteran in pain. The approach includes a continuum of care and incorporates non-pharmacological pain treatment options like stress reduction, yoga, tai chi, mindfulness, chiropractic care, nutrition, acupuncture, and health coaching. VA facilities have seen significant reductions in opioid prescriptions, with some facilities reducing rates by 71% and 69%. VA is also implementing an integrated electronic health records system that will improve pain medication management and identify veterans at higher risk for opioid addiction and suicide. The VA has also distributed the drug Naloxone to prevent opioid-related tragedies and uses predictive analytics to identify veterans at risk. While there is still more to learn and do, VA is leading the way in combating the opioid epidemic among veterans.
