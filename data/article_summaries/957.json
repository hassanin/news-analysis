On May 15, 2019, the President declared a national emergency due to the threat posed by the acquisition and use of certain information and communications technology and services transactions by foreign adversaries. This unrestricted acquisition and use allows foreign adversaries to exploit vulnerabilities in technology and services, posing a threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States. The national emergency declared in 2019 is set to continue beyond May 15, 2023, for another year, in order to secure the information and communications technology and services supply chain. This notice has been published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
