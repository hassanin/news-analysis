The article discusses two events related to the Japan State Dinner at the White House. The first event is a press preview of the dinner, where the First Lady, Michelle Obama, will unveil the Obama State China Service. The China Service was purchased with a special donation from the White House Endowment Trust. Samples of place settings for the State Dinner will also be on display. The second event is a visit by Michelle Obama and Mrs. Akie Abe, the wife of the Prime Minister of Japan, to Great Falls Elementary School in Virginia. They will tour a Japanese Immersion classroom and deliver remarks at a school-wide assembly. A Kwanzan cherry tree will also be planted in the school's Japanese Garden in commemoration. Great Falls Elementary has had a strong connection with the Abes over the years.
