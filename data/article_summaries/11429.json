The White House has announced the launch of the Summer Opportunity Project, which aims to provide young people with access to their first job and support summer meals and learning programs. The project is a multi-agency effort in partnership with the National Summer Learning Association and other collaborators to increase the percentage of youth in evidence-based summer opportunity programs and decrease youth experiencing violence over the summer. The project also aims to ensure that young Americans have the support they need to get their first job. The article highlights various commitments and initiatives from private sector leaders, federal agencies, and cities to expand and improve summer programs for young people. Additionally, President Obama's FY 2017 Budget includes nearly $6 billion in new funding to help young people gain work experience, skills, and networks through their first job. The budget also proposes $12 billion over ten years to provide summer meals through a Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer for Children program.
