The Trump Administration is appealing to the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court decision that would require the President to include illegal aliens in the population count used to redistribute congressional seats. The Administration argues that the President has the authority to exclude illegal aliens to the maximum extent feasible and in line with the discretion given to him by law. They believe that including illegal aliens in the count would diminish the representation of American citizens in Congress. The district court's order does not prevent the Department of Commerce from preparing to implement the President's policy of excluding illegal aliens from the count, and it does not affect the President's previous Executive Order requiring federal agencies to cooperate in compiling citizenship and immigration status data. The Federal Government is continuing its efforts to secure an accurate count, and they are looking forward to the Supreme Court's review of the district court's decision.
