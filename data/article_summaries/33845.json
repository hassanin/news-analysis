President Donald J. Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the situation in Burundi will continue beyond November 22, 2020. The situation in Burundi, characterized by violence against civilians, political repression, and unrest, poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. While acknowledging the recent peaceful transfer of power in Burundi, President Trump has not found sufficient evidence that the situation is resolved, and therefore, the national emergency will continue.
