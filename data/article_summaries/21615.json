President Obama has declared a major disaster in Massachusetts due to severe storms and tornadoes that occurred on June 1, 2011. This declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to affected individuals and communities in Hampden and Worcester Counties. The assistance can include grants for temporary housing, home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will coordinate federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone.
