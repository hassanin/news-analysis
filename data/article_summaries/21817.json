This article is a Presidential Memorandum from January 26, 2009, regarding fuel economy standards for automobiles. The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 mandates that the Secretary of Transportation increase fuel economy for automobiles starting from model year 2011, with a goal of achieving a combined fuel economy fleet average of at least 35 miles per gallon by model year 2020. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in May 2008, but has not yet published a final rule. The memorandum requests that the NHTSA publish a final rule for model year 2011 by March 30, 2009, and consider legal factors, comments, technological and scientific considerations, and a forthcoming report by the National Academy of Sciences for future model years. It also asks for consideration of the consistency of provisions regarding preemption with EISA, the Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, and other relevant laws and policies. The memorandum does not create any enforceable rights or benefits. The Secretary of Transportation is authorized and directed to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
