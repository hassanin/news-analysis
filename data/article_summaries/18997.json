This memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama, addresses the provision of aviation insurance coverage for commercial air carrier services in both domestic and international operations. The President determines that the continuation of U.S. air transportation is necessary for air commerce, national security, and foreign policy interests. The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to provide insurance or reinsurance to U.S.-certificated air carriers against loss or damage resulting from aircraft operations, if such coverage cannot be obtained on reasonable terms from an authorized insurance company in a U.S. state. This approval is valid until January 15, 2014, and the Secretary is delegated the authority to extend this approval until December 31, 2014, subject to certain conditions. The determination and approval must be promptly communicated to all air carriers and published in the Federal Register.
