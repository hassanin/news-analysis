President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Vermont due to severe winter storms that occurred from December 20-26, 2013. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. Federal funding will be available to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, to cover the cost of emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures will also be funded on a cost-sharing basis statewide. James N. Russo has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
