The Bureau of Economic Analysis released its advance estimate for United States GDP for the fourth quarter of 2019 and the entire calendar year of 2019. The estimate shows that real GDP grew 2.1 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2.3 percent over the four quarters of 2019. Consumer spending and residential investment were key drivers of GDP growth. Despite a slowdown in the rest of the world and the continuation of the longest expansion in American history, the US economy remains resilient. The GDP growth in 2019 exceeded pre-election forecasts, with real GDP beating expectations and growing at a faster rate compared to the expansion period under President Obama. The American economy is stronger than other developed nations' economies, with higher GDP growth than the average of G7 countries. Consumer spending has been robust, driven by rising confidence and historic labor market gains. The unemployment rate is at a 50-year low and there are more job openings than job seekers. Residential investment also rebounded, with strong housing starts data indicating continued strength in the sector. However, GDP growth in 2019 fell short of the Trump Administration's forecast due to unexpected events and factors such as production problems at Boeing, the strike at General Motors, global growth slowdown, and the effects of tighter monetary policy. The signing of the new USMCA deal and the Phase I agreement between the US and China should reduce uncertainty and benefit GDP growth in the long run. Despite missing the GDP forecast in 2019, the current Administration's average absolute errors in GDP forecasts were the lowest among the last five administrations. The advance estimate of fourth quarter GDP suggests that the American economy will continue to expand in 2020.
