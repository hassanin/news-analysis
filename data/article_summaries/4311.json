The Biden-Harris Administration has announced a plan to lower housing costs for homebuyers and homeowners with new FHA-insured mortgages. The plan involves reducing the annual mortgage insurance premium by 0.30 percentage points, from 0.85% to 0.55%, which is expected to save borrowers an average of $800 per year. This change is estimated to benefit around 850,000 homebuyers and homeowners in 2023. 

The FHA-insured mortgages are targeted at homebuyers who may not be able to achieve homeownership otherwise, particularly first-time homebuyers and homebuyers of color. The average home purchased with these mortgages costs around half the price of the national median home and has an average mortgage amount of less than $270,000. 

The reduction in the mortgage insurance premium is made possible by the accumulation of reserves in FHA's mortgage insurance fund, which is currently more than five times the required threshold set by Congress. The premium reduction will take effect on March 20 and will be reflected in the President's FY 2024 Budget.

This announcement is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to housing stability and affordability. They have implemented measures to protect homeowners from foreclosure, provided assistance to struggling homeowners through the Homeowner Assistance Fund, and established an eviction prevention infrastructure. Other actions include changes to FHA's underwriting policies, expanded access to housing counseling, and addressing racial and ethnic bias in home valuations. The Administration has also taken steps to increase the overall supply of housing and secure rental assistance for households in need.
