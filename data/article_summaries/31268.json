The United States strongly condemns the release of Hafiz Saeed, leader of the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT) terrorist group, from house arrest in Pakistan. LeT is responsible for numerous terrorist attacks, including the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Saeed himself is accused of masterminding the Mumbai attacks, which killed 166 people, including six Americans. He was designated as a terrorist by the United Nations and the Department of the Treasury, and the US has offered a $10 million reward for information leading to his capture. Pakistan's failure to prosecute or charge Saeed sends a troubling message about its commitment to fighting terrorism and contradicts its claims of not providing sanctuary for terrorists. The US expects Pakistan to take decisive action against militant and terrorist groups on its soil, and Saeed's release is seen as a step in the wrong direction. The Pakistani government now has an opportunity to demonstrate its seriousness in combating terrorism by arresting and charging Saeed for his crimes. Failure to do so may have repercussions for bilateral relations and Pakistan's global reputation.
