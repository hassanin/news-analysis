President Donald Trump issued a proclamation on National Agriculture Day, recognizing the contributions of farmers, ranchers, growers, producers, and foresters to the nation. He emphasized the importance of American agriculture in strengthening the economy, with agriculture exports valued at over $141 billion and supporting approximately 8,400 American jobs for every $1 billion in exports. The administration is working to modernize trade agreements and remove barriers to open foreign markets for American agricultural products. Trump also highlighted the need to streamline the regulatory environment to support agricultural innovation and meet the growing demand for food. He mentioned the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, which strengthens farm safety-net programs, promotes natural resource management, and supports rural development and research initiatives. The law also requires collaboration between the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Agriculture to enhance broadband deployment in rural areas. Trump expressed gratitude to farmers, growers, ranchers, and producers for their hard work, self-reliance, and dedication to family. He proclaimed March 14, 2019, as National Agriculture Day, urging all Americans to recognize the importance of agriculture in their daily lives and show appreciation for those in the agriculture sector.
