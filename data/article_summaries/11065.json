President Obama has nominated three individuals to serve on the United States District Court: Judge Elissa F. Cadish for the District of Nevada, Judge Paul William Grimm for the District of Maryland, and Judge Mark E. Walker for the Northern District of Florida. These nominees have demonstrated a strong commitment to justice and integrity throughout their careers.

Judge Grimm has been a United States Magistrate Judge since 1997 and has a background in private practice and government positions. Judge Walker has been a Florida Circuit Judge since 2009, with previous clerkships and experience in private practice. President Obama believes that these nominees will serve the American people well from the United States District Court bench.
