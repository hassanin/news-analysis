President Biden has endorsed the findings and recommendations of the Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault in the Military, which recommends removing cases of sexual assault, sexual harassment, and related crimes from the military chain of command. The Commission, led by Lynn Rosenthal and comprised of 12 experts, was tasked with making recommendations in four key areas: accountability, prevention, climate and culture, and survivor care and support. The Commission found a gap between what senior leaders say about the problem and how junior enlisted members experience it. They also identified deficiencies in the military justice system, lack of specialization and experience in the workforce, and the heavy burden carried by victims. The President appreciates Secretary of Defense Austin's leadership in addressing the issue and plans to work with Congress to implement legislative changes to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The timeline for implementation and specific details will be determined by the Department of Defense. The goal is to create a culture of no tolerance for sexual assault and harassment in the military and improve victim care and support.
