First Lady Melania Trump and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Ben Carson, visited the National Archives of the United States to view the Emancipation Proclamation and the Charters of Freedom. They were joined by David Ferriero, Archivist of the United States, and Maureen MacDonald, Special Assistant to the Archivist. They first viewed the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights in the Rotunda, which are the three founding documents of America. They then visited the Archivist's Reception Room to view the 13th Amendment, the 19th Amendment, and the 1965 Act that created HUD. Trevor Plante, director of the Archives Textual Records Division, provided an overview of these documents and emphasized the significance of the Emancipation Proclamation in advancing equality. They also viewed General Order Number 3, which announced the freedom of all slaves on June 19, 1865, two and a half years after the Emancipation Proclamation. The First Lady praised the National Archives as a sanctuary for the written word and a symbol of liberty, justice, and equality. She thanked the institution for providing access to important historical documents for all Americans to exercise their rights and responsibilities as citizens.
