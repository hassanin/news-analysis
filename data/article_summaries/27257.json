The article discusses a meeting between President Donald Trump and American families who lost loved ones to crimes committed by illegal immigrants. The families urged the passage of two pieces of legislation: Kate's Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. Kate's Law aims to enhance penalties for those who repeatedly enter the country illegally, while the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act seeks to cut federal grant money to cities that prevent law enforcement from turning over dangerous criminal aliens to federal authorities. The families shared personal stories of the tragic consequences of illegal immigration, emphasizing the need for action to prevent further loss and protect public safety. The President is calling on the Senate to swiftly pass these bills.
