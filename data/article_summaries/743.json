In a press conference, President Biden discussed the urgent need to raise the debt limit and criticized Republicans in Congress for their refusal to do so. He emphasized that raising the debt limit is about paying off old debts and has nothing to do with new spending. The President highlighted that the United States has always paid its bills and never defaulted, but raising the debt limit is crucial to meet financial obligations such as Social Security benefits, salaries for service members, and benefits for veterans. He criticized the previous Trump administration for incurring nearly $8 trillion in additional debt in just four years. The President also expressed concern that failure to raise the debt limit would lead to a self-inflicted economic crisis, including a downgrade in the American credit rating and increased interest rates for mortgages, loans, and credit cards. He called on Republicans to stop obstructing and using procedural tricks to prevent the debt limit from being raised, stating that it is hypocritical, dangerous, and disgraceful. The President also addressed questions about his ability to pass legislation within his own party and the ongoing negotiations for his Build Back Better agenda. He declined to comment on specific figures but emphasized the importance of investing in education and childcare. When asked about the tactics used by activists to pressure Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, the President stated that while he doesn't find those tactics appropriate, they are part of the political process. He also briefly mentioned the Pandora Papers and stated that his administration is looking into the matter. The President concluded by stating that he cannot guarantee that the U.S. will not reach the debt ceiling, as it ultimately depends on Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.
