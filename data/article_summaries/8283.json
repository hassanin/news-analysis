On June 19, 1865, enslaved Americans in Galveston, Texas, were finally informed of their freedom, almost two years after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed. This day, known as Juneteenth, has become a symbol of freedom and is now recognized as a national holiday in the United States. President Biden acknowledges the significance of Juneteenth, referring to it as a day of profound weight and power. He recognizes the historical legacy of slavery and systemic racism in America, but also emphasizes the capacity to heal and progress as a nation. President Biden calls for a commitment to equity, equality, and justice, recognizing the ongoing work that needs to be done, particularly in addressing racial disparities highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic. He proclaims June 19, 2021, as Juneteenth Day of Observance and calls upon the American people to acknowledge and celebrate the end of the Civil War and the emancipation of Black Americans, while also committing to eradicating systemic racism.
