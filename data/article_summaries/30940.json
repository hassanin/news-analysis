The article discusses the annual "Profile in Courage" award, which recognizes public officials who demonstrate politically courageous leadership. The author highlights the story of Senator Edmund G. Ross of Kansas, who defied his own party's effort to impeach President Andrew Johnson in 1868. Despite facing immense pressure and threats, Ross voted to acquit Johnson, believing that giving Congress too much power over presidential appointments would undermine the political fabric of the country. The author draws parallels between Ross's time and the current partisan impeachment proceedings, suggesting that a Senate Democrat who stands up against their own party's impeachment efforts would be a true profile in courage.
