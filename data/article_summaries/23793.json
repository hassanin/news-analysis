First Lady Michelle Obama has announced that seven organizations have joined or renewed their support for the Drink Up initiative, which aims to encourage Americans to drink more water. The organizations include Brita, First 5 Santa Clara County, Haws Corporation, Nalgene Outdoor Products, S'well Bottle, Santa Clara Valley Water District, and The California Endowment. These organizations will promote the campaign's message on water filtration systems, reusable water bottles, drinking fountains, and other products and programs. The First Lady also highlighted a study that showed a 3% increase in sales of bottled water among those exposed to the Drink Up ad campaign. The Partnership for a Healthier America (PHA) CEO, Lawrence A. Soler, stated that the additional commitments from these organizations will help make choosing water an easy choice for more people. The goal of the initiative is to provide access to water for more people, regardless of whether it is tap, filtered, or bottled.
