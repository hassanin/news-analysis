The Biden-Harris Administration is working to help women enter and succeed in skilled construction trades. They met with union tradeswomen and representatives from North America's Building Trades Unions to discuss opportunities and challenges for women in the construction industry. The administration is focusing on investing in flexible child care and supportive services, expanding pre-apprenticeship programs, strengthening mentoring initiatives, and addressing discrimination and harassment. The Investing in America agenda, which includes the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act, is creating millions of good-paying jobs across the country, many of which do not require a college degree. Under President Biden's leadership, 670,000 construction jobs have been added since January 2021, creating a demand for skilled trades. However, women make up only 14 percent of the construction workforce and 4 percent of the trades. The administration believes that their economic agenda can attract more women to the construction sector and meet the demand for skilled workers. They are promoting supportive services like child care and have launched Workforce Hubs to create new pipelines to good jobs. Historic funding has been secured to expand and diversify registered apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs. Companies receiving funding through the CHIPS and Science Act are required to provide child care. The Department of Labor's Megaprojects Program is providing support for equal employment opportunities and non-discrimination practices, and an Executive Order has been signed on the Use of Project Labor Agreements.
