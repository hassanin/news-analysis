On August 23, 2022, the United States conducted precision strikes against a facility in eastern Syria. The facility was being used by militia groups affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who had been carrying out attacks against US personnel and facilities in Syria. These strikes were carried out to protect the safety of US personnel, disrupt ongoing attacks, and deter Iran and its backed militias from further targeting US personnel and facilities. The strikes targeted a facility used for logistics and ammunition storage. The action was taken under the authority of the President as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive, in line with the responsibility to protect US citizens and national security interests. The United States asserts that the strikes were necessary and proportionate and conducted in accordance with international law and the right to self-defense outlined in the United Nations Charter. The President is prepared to take further action if needed. This report is provided to Congress as part of the President's efforts to keep them informed, as required by the War Powers Resolution.
