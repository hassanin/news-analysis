First Lady Michelle Obama, PBS, and several government departments have announced the winners of the Healthy Lunchtime Challenge, a nationwide recipe challenge for kids that promotes cooking and healthy eating. The winners, representing all U.S. states, five territories, and the District of Columbia, will attend a Kids' "State Dinner" at the White House on July 14. The challenge encourages kids to create a healthy, affordable, original, and delicious lunch recipe that meets the USDA's recommended nutrition guidance. This year's challenge also focused on using local ingredients grown in the entrant's state, territory, or community. The winners will have the opportunity to learn from child nutrition advocate Rachael Ray and have their recipes featured on Blue Apron's menu. The full list of winners and recipes can be found on pbs.org. A free downloadable e-cookbook of the winning recipes will be available on July 14.
