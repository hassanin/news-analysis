Acting Commissioner Morgan of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) provided an update on southwest border enforcement statistics for the month of October. He highlighted the decline in apprehensions, with a 14 percent decrease compared to September and an overall decrease of almost 70 percent since the peak in May. Morgan emphasized the success of initiatives, policies, and regulations implemented by the administration, as well as the cooperation with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries. He mentioned the shift in demographics, with Mexico becoming the country of origin for the majority of apprehensions. However, Morgan also stressed that there is still a humanitarian and national security crisis at the southern border, with cartels exploiting migrants and flooding the country with dangerous drugs. He emphasized the need for resources, including the construction of a border wall, to address both crises and put the cartels out of business. During the press briefing, Morgan also addressed questions about the arrest rates of CBP officers, land acquisition challenges for the wall construction, and the safety of migrants in Mexico under the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).
