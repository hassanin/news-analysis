Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa has passed away, leaving many heartbroken. Tutu's courage and moral clarity inspired efforts to change American policy towards the repressive Apartheid regime in South Africa. He was known for his warmth and joy, as well as his message of justice, equality, truth, and reconciliation. Tutu's legacy transcends borders and will be remembered throughout history. The Biden family sends their deepest condolences to Tutu's wife, children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, and the people of the United States extend their condolences to the people of South Africa. May God bless Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
