The President expresses disappointment over the Senate's failure to pass the National Defense Authorization Act. He criticizes a minority of Senators for blocking the bill, which has bipartisan support. The President specifically mentions opposition to the repeal of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' as a reason for the filibuster. He argues that this law is discriminatory and weakens national security. The President thanks certain Senators for their work on the bill and urges the Senate to address these issues during the lame duck session.
