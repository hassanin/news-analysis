Jake Sullivan, the National Security Advisor of the United States, delivered a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He discussed the complex global challenges that the world is currently facing, including strategic competition, disruptive technological change, and the need to adapt the international economic system. Sullivan highlighted the importance of rallying a global response to push back against aggression, pursuing diplomacy to manage key relationships, and investing in national strength and alliances. He emphasized the need to support Ukraine in its ongoing conflict with Russia, as well as to address aggression in the Middle East, particularly from Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. Sullivan also discussed the United States' competition with China, stating that while the US is not seeking confrontation, it is intensifying diplomacy to reduce the risk of miscalculation. He highlighted the importance of technological competition, ensuring that critical technologies do not undermine national security, and working with partners to set high standards for emerging technologies. Sullivan expressed optimism about the future, stating that as long as countries focus on delivering for their citizens, promoting shared economic growth, tackling climate change, and advancing good governance, the international model will remain more attractive than aggression or coercion. He also emphasized the need to shape the future for the benefit of future generations and to continue working towards a rules-based international order.
