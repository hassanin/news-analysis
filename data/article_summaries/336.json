On August 17, 2001, the President issued Executive Order 13222 declaring a national emergency related to the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979. This national emergency has been extended by President Biden for another year, until August 17, 2023. The extension is necessary because certain sanctions authorities need to be implemented under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The notice of this extension will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
