The Biden administration held a teleconference to discuss their operational plan for vaccinating children against COVID-19. The FDA's advisory committee will review the data submitted by Pfizer and Moderna for their vaccines for children under six and under five on June 14th and 15th. The CDC's advisory committee will meet on June 17th and 18th to issue their recommendation. Vaccinations for children could start as early as June 21st if authorized. The administration is focused on making the vaccines easily accessible and providing parents with information to make informed decisions. Vaccinations will be available at pediatricians' offices, pharmacies, clinics, and other trusted locations. The administration will also work with various organizations to raise awareness and answer questions. Orders for the initial 10 million doses have been slow, but more doses will be available in the coming weeks. The administration is prepared to distribute both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and is not prioritizing one over the other. The administration is also planning to donate pediatric doses to foreign countries in need.
