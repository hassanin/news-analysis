The President has signed legislation, S. 3104, that provides permanent authorization for Radio Free Asia (RFA). RFA's mission is to provide accurate and timely news to people in seven Asian countries without a free press. It currently broadcasts in nine Asian languages and has received numerous journalism awards for its factual and impartial news coverage. The White House will continue to work with Congress to support RFA's work and hopes to increase its audience reach in the future.
