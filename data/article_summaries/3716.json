The article discusses the positive news that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment has reached its lowest levels since the start of the pandemic. It mentions that there have been six out of seven weeks of declining claims and a nearly 60% drop in average claims since President Biden took office. This is seen as encouraging for American families who have been struggling due to the economic impact of the pandemic. The article also highlights that there have been seven consecutive positive job reports, resulting in the addition of nearly 4.5 million jobs since the start of the Biden administration. The decline in unemployment claims is seen as further evidence of a durable economic recovery.

Despite the ongoing impact of the Delta variant, the article argues that the Biden plan is working and yielding real results. Job growth has increased significantly, with 750,000 jobs added per month over the last three months. This is almost double the previous record for job creation by any first-year President. The economy has also experienced strong growth, with the first half of the year seeing the fastest rate in nearly 40 years. The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.2% in August, the lowest since the beginning of the pandemic. Additionally, the article notes that the American economy is the only developed country whose economy is now larger than it was before the pandemic.

The article acknowledges that there is still work to be done to build an economy that benefits all Americans, but expresses confidence in the Biden administration's strategy. A recent Gallup poll indicates that 72% of Americans believe it is a good time to find a quality job, a higher number than during the pandemic and higher than in 2019. This suggests that the economy is providing opportunities for regular Americans and is focused on increasing wages and ensuring the dignity of all people. The article concludes by stating that with smart investments in American families and the country itself, consistent progress can be made to build back better.
