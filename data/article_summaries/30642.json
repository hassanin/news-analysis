President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Missouri due to severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred from April 28 to May 11, 2017. This declaration allows for federal funding to be made available to affected individuals and counties for assistance with temporary housing, home repairs, and low-cost loans for uninsured property losses. State, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, can also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding. Michael L. Parker has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. (local time) seven days a week until further notice.
