President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Wisconsin and authorized Federal assistance for areas affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, and flooding from June 15 to June 19, 2018. This assistance will supplement State and local recovery efforts and will be available to eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis. The counties of Ashland, Bayfield, Burnett, Clark, Douglas, and Iron have been specifically identified for assistance. Federal funding is also available for hazard mitigation measures statewide. David G. Samaniego has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Further damage assessments may result in additional designations at a later date if requested by the State. Media inquiries can be directed to the FEMA News Desk.
