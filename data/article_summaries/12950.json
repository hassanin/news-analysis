President Barack Obama has proclaimed December 2011 as National Impaired Driving Prevention Month in an effort to reduce the number of traffic accidents caused by drugs, alcohol, and distracted driving. The proclamation emphasizes the need for rigorous enforcement measures and effective substance abuse prevention programs to prevent these tragic outcomes. The administration is working towards decreasing drugged driving incidents by 10 percent over the next five years and collaborating with state and local governments to bolster enforcement efforts and support evidence-based prevention programs. The proclamation also highlights the importance of parents, educators, and community leaders in advocating responsible decision-making and building awareness about impaired driving, particularly among younger drivers. The administration has released a toolkit with resources and information to help families and communities address the issue. The proclamation calls on all Americans to make responsible decisions and take appropriate measures to prevent impaired driving.
