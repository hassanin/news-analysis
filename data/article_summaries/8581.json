Deputy National Security Advisory for Cyber and Emerging Technologies, Anne Neuberger, visited Brussels from November 8-10 to collaborate with allies and international partners on cybersecurity efforts. Neuberger engaged in discussions with EU officials and members of the EU parliament regarding cybersecurity and emerging technology policies. She also met with the North Atlantic Council at NATO to explore methods of enhancing national and Alliance resilience in cyberspace. Neuberger recommended areas where NATO Allies can collectively defend against, deter, and respond to cyber threats. This visit builds on the Biden Administration's efforts to foster international cooperation in addressing cyber threats, including holding nations accountable for harboring ransomware criminals, imposing costs on nation-states for malicious cyber activity, and promoting cooperation to counter ransomware.
