On August 2, 2019, the President signed two laws. The first law, H.R. 3877, known as the "Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019," raises the limits on discretionary spending for the fiscal years 2020-2021. It also temporarily suspends the public debt limit until July 31, 2021, and establishes procedures for creating a Congressional budget for the same fiscal years. The second law, S. 2249, makes an exception to allow former military officers to fill both the positions of Administrator and Deputy Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.
