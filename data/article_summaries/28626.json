In a press conference on September 7, President Trump discussed various topics including the economy, job growth, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the upcoming election. He touted the current economic recovery as the fastest in U.S. history and highlighted the addition of 1.4 million jobs in August and a record-setting 10.6 million jobs added since May. He criticized Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden for presiding over a weak economic recovery during his time as Vice President and expressed confidence that next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of the country under his leadership. Trump also discussed the progress on developing a COVID-19 vaccine and criticized Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris for their anti-vaccine rhetoric. He accused them of playing politics and undermining science, while asserting that the vaccine would be safe and effective. The President also addressed other topics such as the investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and the teaching of the 1619 Project in schools.
