This article is the text of Executive Order 13539, signed by President Barack Obama on April 21, 2010. The order establishes the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), which is an advisory council on science, technology, and innovation. The PCAST is composed of up to 21 members, including the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology as the Science Advisor. The order outlines the functions of the PCAST, which include advising the President on science, technology, and innovation policy, as well as providing scientific and technical information for public policy. The PCAST is also designated as the advisory committee for the High-Performance Computing Act and the National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel. The order states that executive departments and agencies should provide the PCAST with information when requested. It also authorizes the creation of standing subcommittees and ad hoc groups, and allows members without security clearance to receive clearance for classified matters. The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is responsible for providing funding and support to the PCAST. Members of the PCAST serve without compensation but may receive travel expenses. The order specifies that the PCAST will terminate after two years unless extended by the President. It also states that the Director of the OSTP will perform functions under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, and that the order does not affect existing authorities or functions. The order is to be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations, and it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits. Finally, the order revokes Executive Order 13226 from September 30, 2001.
