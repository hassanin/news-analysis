President Donald Trump issued a proclamation on January 26, 2017, emphasizing the importance of education and school choice in the United States. He believes that every child should have the opportunity to receive a great education and that parents should have the right to choose where their child goes to school. Trump encourages the expansion of school choice and the provision of more educational opportunities for American families. He acknowledges the presence of great schools and teachers in various settings, including public, charter, magnet, private, religious, and homeschooling environments. Trump calls on states and communities to support effective education and school choice for every child. He also encourages parents to evaluate the educational opportunities available for their children, and urges state and federal lawmakers to expand school choice for more students. As a result, Trump proclaims January 22 through January 28, 2017, as National School Choice Week.
