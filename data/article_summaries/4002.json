The United States has announced the successful destruction of its entire chemical weapons stockpile, marking the first time an international body has verified the destruction of a category of declared weapons of mass destruction. The achievement is a result of more than 30 years of work and commitment under the Chemical Weapons Convention. The US urges other nations, particularly Russia and Syria, to join the Convention and admit their undeclared chemical weapons programs. The US will continue to work with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to prevent the stockpiling, production, and use of chemical weapons globally. The goal is to completely eliminate chemical weapons from the world.
