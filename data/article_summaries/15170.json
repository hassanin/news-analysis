The leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, along with the President of the European Council and President of the European Commission, have condemned Russia's violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. They call on Russia to address any concerns through direct negotiations or international observation and mediation. The leaders also urge all parties to exercise self-restraint and decrease tensions. As a result of Russia's actions, the G-7 leaders have decided to suspend their participation in activities associated with the G-8 Summit in Sochi until a more conducive environment is established for meaningful discussions. They express their support for Ukraine's sovereignty and right to choose its own future and commit to assisting Ukraine in restoring unity, stability, and economic health. The leaders plan to support Ukraine's negotiations with the International Monetary Fund to implement necessary reforms and unlock additional assistance from other financial institutions and sources.
