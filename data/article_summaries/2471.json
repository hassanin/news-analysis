The Biden administration has signed a new sanctions executive order to impose costs on Russia for its harmful foreign activities. The order targets Russia's efforts to undermine democratic elections, engage in cyber activities, use transnational corruption, target dissidents and journalists, undermine security, and violate international law. The US Treasury has imposed additional sanctions on 32 entities and individuals involved in Russian government-directed attempts to influence the 2020 US presidential election and engage in disinformation and interference. They have also sanctioned individuals and entities associated with Russia's occupation and repression in Crimea. The administration is responding to reports of Russia encouraging Taliban attacks against US and coalition personnel in Afghanistan through diplomatic, military, and intelligence channels. The US is expelling ten personnel from the Russian diplomatic mission in Washington, DC, including representatives of Russian intelligence services. The US has also formally named the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) as the perpetrator of the SolarWinds cyber espionage campaign. The SVR compromised more than 16,000 computer systems worldwide, and the US is issuing a cybersecurity advisory to provide details on software vulnerabilities and steps to defend against the SVR's malicious cyber activity. The US government is evaluating actions to protect the ICTS supply chain from further exploitation by Russia. The US is also taking steps to strengthen global cybersecurity cooperation with allies and partners.
