President Donald J. Trump has transmitted an agreement between the United States and Mexico for cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear energy to the Congress. The agreement meets all applicable statutory requirements and aims to advance nonproliferation and other foreign policy interests of the United States. It allows for the transfer of material, equipment, and information for nuclear research and power production, but not restricted data or sensitive nuclear technology. Mexico affirms its intent to rely on existing international markets for nuclear fuel services involving sensitive technologies, while the United States agrees to support these markets and ensure a reliable supply of low enriched uranium fuel to Mexico. The agreement has a term of 30 years and can be terminated with one year's notice. Nonproliferation conditions and controls will continue in effect after termination or expiration. Mexico has a strong track record on nonproliferation and has implemented nuclear export controls in line with international guidelines. President Trump has approved the agreement and urges Congress to give it favorable consideration. Consultations with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee will begin, followed by a review period.
