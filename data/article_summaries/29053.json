The White House recently hosted a virtual roundtable discussion on embracing technology and telehealth, where the Pledge to Embrace Technology to Advance America's Health was launched. This pledge aims to ensure that telehealth is here to stay and will be covered over the long term. Over 50 healthcare stakeholders have committed to expanding telehealth coverage and adoption. The Trump Administration has prioritized telehealth innovation since 2017, and the COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of telehealth solutions. The Administration's actions during the public health emergency resulted in a 4300% increase in telehealth utilization nationwide. The President signed an Executive Order on Improving Rural Health and Telehealth Access, directing the extension of telehealth services for Medicare beneficiaries beyond the public health emergency. The Pledge calls on healthcare insurers to expand flexible and affordable telehealth options, and healthcare providers to accelerate the adoption of telehealth solutions. This commitment aims to empower Americans to choose the healthcare team that is right for them and receive more tailored and affordable care.
