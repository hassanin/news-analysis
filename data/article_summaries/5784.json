The United States is taking additional steps to expand access to safe and legal migration pathways following productive meetings between President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and a U.S. Delegation. They are announcing their support for an international multipurpose space that the Government of Mexico plans to establish in southern Mexico to offer refugee and labor options for vulnerable individuals in Mexico. The United States also commits to accepting refugee resettlement referrals from qualified individuals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela who are already in Mexico. This builds on previous initiatives launched by President Biden and President Lopez Obrador to create legal pathways for migration. The cooperation between the two countries is seen as a testament to their strong friendship and partnership. However, those attempting to enter the United States unlawfully will still face consequences such as removal, possible criminal prosecution, and a bar on reentry.
