The United States has assessed with confidence that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons in the eastern Damascus suburb of Duma on April 7, 2018, resulting in the deaths of dozens of people and severe injuries to hundreds more. The conclusion is based on descriptions of the attack from multiple sources, reported symptoms of the victims, videos and images of the attack, and reliable information indicating coordination between Syrian military officials. The use of chlorine and possibly the nerve agent sarin is indicated. This is not an isolated incident, as the Syrian regime has a history of using chemical weapons despite pledging to give up its chemical weapons program. The regime's use of chemical weapons is part of its strategy to terrorize and subdue both opposition fighters and civilians, and it makes no effort to distinguish between military and civilian targets. The continued use of chemical weapons by the regime threatens to weaken prohibitions against their use and increase the likelihood of other states acquiring and using these weapons. The regime has repeatedly used chemical weapons to compensate for its lack of military manpower and to achieve its goals on the battlefield. The Syrian military has the ability to produce and use more chemical weapons, including sarin and chlorine. The regime also retains the expertise necessary to develop new weapons. The recent attack in Duma is part of a pattern of chemical weapons use by the regime, including previous attacks in Khan Shaykhun and the Damascus suburb of Harasta. The regime's use of chemical weapons will continue until the costs outweigh any perceived military advantages.
