President Biden has issued a memorandum addressing the long-term effects of COVID-19 in the United States. The memorandum emphasizes the devastating impact of the pandemic, with over 950,000 lives lost and many families and communities still dealing with the profound loss. It acknowledges the long-lasting effects of COVID-19, commonly referred to as "long COVID," which can affect individuals of all ages, races, genders, and health conditions. These effects can include anxiety, depression, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and other symptoms that persist even after the acute infection has resolved. The memorandum highlights the need for a coordinated government-wide response to support individuals experiencing long COVID and those grappling with mental health and substance use issues exacerbated by the pandemic. It calls for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to lead these efforts and collaborate with relevant stakeholders to develop a national research agenda on long COVID. The memorandum also emphasizes the importance of addressing disparities in access to services and support for underserved communities. A public report outlining the services and mechanisms of support across agencies is to be published within 120 days. The memorandum concludes by stating that it does not impair or affect existing authorities and is subject to available appropriations.
