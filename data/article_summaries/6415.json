This article discusses an executive order issued by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. regarding the use of project labor agreements in large-scale construction projects undertaken by the federal government. The order aims to promote economy and efficiency in federal procurement by addressing challenges such as labor cost unpredictability, labor disputes, and lack of coordination among multiple employers involved in construction projects. Project labor agreements are seen as effective in preventing these problems by providing structure, stability, and dispute resolution mechanisms. The order requires agencies to use project labor agreements for large-scale construction projects, with certain exceptions granted by senior officials. The order also mandates the publication of data on the use of project labor agreements and reporting to the Office of Management and Budget. The order revokes a previous executive order on the same subject and requires the development of regulations and training strategies for implementation.
