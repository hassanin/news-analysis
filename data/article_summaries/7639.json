The United States has joined global partners in making commitments to the Generation Equality Forum, which aims to advance gender equity and equality. The forum, convened by UN Women and co-hosted by France and Mexico, commemorates the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing over 25 years ago. Despite progress since then, gaps remain, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. commitments align with the Biden-Harris Administration's priorities, including policy and resource commitments in areas such as preventing and responding to gender-based violence, advancing women's economic security and promoting economic justice, and protecting and expanding sexual and reproductive health and rights. These commitments reflect broader U.S. efforts to advance gender equity and equality in various areas, including climate, science and technology, leadership and democracy, and education. The U.S. also supports the Build Back Better World Partnership to address infrastructure needs in low- and middle-income countries. Additionally, the U.S. has signed on to the Compact on Women, Peace, and Security and Humanitarian Action and is implementing the U.S. Women, Peace, and Security Act to improve women's participation in peace and security processes.
