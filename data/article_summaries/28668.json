On August 6, 2018, President Donald Trump issued new executive orders related to foreign policy. The orders were issued in response to the United States' decision to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, and reimpose sanctions on Iran. The orders authorize the imposition of sanctions on individuals and entities that provide support for the Iranian government's purchase of US bank notes or precious metals, as well as those involved in Iran's energy, shipping, and shipbuilding sectors. The orders also allow for the imposition of sanctions on foreign financial institutions that conduct significant transactions with Iran's automotive sector, petroleum sector, or petrochemical sector. Additionally, the orders authorize sanctions on individuals and entities involved in corruption, human rights abuses, and censorship in Iran. The orders also include provisions to block property and interests in property of sanctioned individuals and entities. The orders take effect on August 7, 2018.
