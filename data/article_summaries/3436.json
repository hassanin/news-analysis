National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with Iranian-American journalist and activist Masih Alinejad and her husband Kambiz Foroohar. Sullivan expressed concern for Alinejad's family and colleagues who are detained in Iran and reaffirmed the US Government's support for her work on advancing human rights. He also noted the growing trend of authoritarian regimes, like Iran, targeting dissidents, activists, and journalists across borders, including within the United States. The US Government will continue to oppose these illegal actions that violate human rights and threaten the rules-based international order.
