On March 9, 2016, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, S. 238, is called the "Eric Williams Correctional Officer Protection Act of 2015." This law requires the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), within the Department of Justice, to provide oleoresin capsicum spray (pepper spray) to any BOP officer or employee who works in a prison that is not a minimum or low security prison, may respond to emergency situations in that prison, and completes the required training on the use of the spray. The second bill, S. 1596, designates the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 2082 Stringtown Road in Grove City, Ohio, as the Specialist Joseph W. Riley Post Office Building.
