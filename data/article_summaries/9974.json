Vice President Biden will be holding a roundtable with business leaders in New York to discuss the implementation of the Recovery Act. The event will focus on how the act is creating and saving jobs, as well as creating new business opportunities. The roundtable will take place at Pace University's Lubin School of Business and will be attended by Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Department Neal Wolin, New York officials, and representatives from Pace University. Due to limited space, the event will be pooled.
