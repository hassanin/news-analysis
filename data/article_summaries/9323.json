The Biden Administration is releasing $39 billion of American Rescue Plan funds to address the child care crisis caused by COVID-19. These funds will help early childhood educators and family child care providers keep their doors open and support parents, especially mothers, who want to get back to work. The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted women, with roughly 2 million leaving the labor force due to caregiving needs. This has resulted in a predicted increase in the gender earnings gap. The funds will also support early childhood and child care providers, who have been hit hard by the pandemic. These providers, mostly small businesses owned by women and people of color, have faced decreasing revenues and higher expenses for personal protective equipment and sanitation. Many child care providers have closed, hindering access to care, especially for families of color. The $39 billion funding release will provide support to childcare providers and educators, create a safe learning environment for children, and help parents, particularly mothers, return to work. States, tribes, and territories can use the funds to stabilize child care providers, make child care more affordable, increase access to high-quality care, and support early childhood workers. Additionally, the American Rescue Plan includes an increase in support for child care through the tax code, providing financial assistance to working families.
