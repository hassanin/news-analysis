On July 24, 2011, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency with respect to transnational criminal organizations. This was done to address the threat that these organizations pose to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. These organizations have become increasingly sophisticated and dangerous, and they are involved in activities that undermine democratic institutions, weaken the rule of law, and disrupt economic markets. On March 15, 2019, President Trump took additional steps to deal with this national emergency, given the evolving nature of these organizations and their ability to generate revenue through illegal conduct. The national emergency declared in 2011, as well as the measures adopted to address it, will continue to be in effect beyond July 24, 2019. President Trump has decided to extend the national emergency for another year. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
