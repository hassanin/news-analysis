The White House Press Secretary issued a statement criticizing House Republicans for passing a budget that prioritizes tax cuts for the wealthy and maintains sequestration cuts to investments in the middle class. The statement also highlights that the budget fails to adequately fund national security and uses budget gimmicks. In contrast, the President's budget aims to reverse sequestration and promote middle-class economics through investments in research, education, training, and infrastructure. The President has made it clear that he will not accept a budget that locks in sequestration or increases funding for national security without corresponding increases in economic security. The Administration will continue to uphold these principles going forward.
