The White House Press Secretary issued a statement on the extension of the Iran Sanctions Act (H.R. 6297). The Administration views the extension as unnecessary but consistent with the commitments made in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The Act, which was in place during the negotiation of the JCPOA and remains in effect, does not impact the ability to fulfill commitments in the JCPOA. The Administration will continue to use necessary authorities to waive relevant sanctions, enforce those outside the scope of the JCPOA, and reimpose sanctions if Iran fails to fulfill its commitments. The statement emphasizes that the JCPOA is a top strategic objective for the United States and its allies, as it ensures Iran cannot develop nuclear weapons. As long as Iran adheres to its commitments, the US remains committed to maintaining its own.
