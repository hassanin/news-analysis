President Obama has signed an Executive Order to create a second Presidential Emergency Board to help resolve a dispute between the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority and its employees. The Board will have 60 days to obtain final offers for settlement from each side and will then produce a report to the President selecting the most reasonable offer. The report is not binding, but the party whose offer is not selected will be prohibited from receiving certain benefits if a work stoppage occurs. President Obama has also announced the members of the Board, including Elizabeth C. Wesman as Chair, Barbara Deinhardt as Member, and David P. Twomey as Member. Dr. Wesman is a labor and employment arbitrator, while Ms. Deinhardt is a labor and employment arbitrator and mediator. Mr. Twomey is a labor arbitrator and professor at Boston College.
