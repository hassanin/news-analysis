The Obama administration met with law enforcement officials to discuss their support for immigration reform. Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano and Director of National Drug Control Policy, R. Gil Kerlikowske, emphasized that immigration reform is crucial for enhancing border security. They highlighted the investments made by the administration to secure the borders, resulting in a significant decrease in illegal border crossings and increased seizures of currency, drugs, and weapons. This meeting is part of the administration's efforts to engage with various stakeholders who support bipartisan immigration reform. Several law enforcement associations participated in the meeting.
