President Biden has signed an Executive Order (E.O.) to address the national emergency declared in November 2020 regarding the military-industrial complex of China. The E.O. expands the national emergency by considering the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside China and its contribution to repression or human rights abuses as threats. This E.O. allows the United States to prohibit U.S. investments in Chinese companies that undermine U.S. security or democratic values. It strengthens the previous E.O. and creates a framework for imposing prohibitions on investments in Chinese defense and surveillance technology firms. The E.O. also prevents U.S. investments from supporting Chinese companies that contribute to the surveillance of religious or ethnic minorities or facilitate repression and human rights abuses. The E.O. lists 59 entities subject to these prohibitions, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control will list these entities on its new Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies List. The listed entities include companies in the defense and surveillance technology sectors of the Chinese economy.
