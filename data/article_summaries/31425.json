In his remarks at the Demilitarized Zone in South Korea, Vice President Mike Pence expressed the United States' commitment to its alliance with South Korea and its objective of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula. He commended the soldiers for their vigilance and emphasized that the goal of denuclearization is shared by allies across the globe, including China. Pence mentioned that all options are on the table to achieve this objective, but that the United States seeks a peaceful resolution. He also highlighted the personal and generational bonds between the people of South Korea and the United States. When asked about a potential preemptive strike, Pence stated that military tactical decisions will not be discussed, but that all options are on the table to ensure the security and stability of South Korea. He also emphasized that the United States seeks peace through strength and that the alliance between South Korea and the United States is ironclad. Pence expressed hope that China will take necessary actions to bring about a change in North Korea's policies, but also made it clear that the United States and its allies will deal with the problem if China does not. Pence stated that the era of strategic patience with North Korea is over, and that President Trump wants to see North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons program and testing of ballistic missiles. The United States is resolved to achieve its objectives through peaceful means, but will also use whatever means necessary to protect the interests and security of South Korea and bring stability to the region.
