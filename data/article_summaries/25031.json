The White House has announced the guests who will be seated in the First Lady's box during the State of the Union Address. The guests represent the progress made during President Obama's time in office, from the economic recovery to criminal justice reform and veterans' issues. One seat will be left empty to honor the victims of gun violence. The guests include a range of individuals, such as a criminal justice reform advocate, a small business owner, a community college student, a Syrian refugee, and a veteran who graduated from the Army Ranger School.
