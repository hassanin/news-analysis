President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation on April 17, 2020, calling for the observance of Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day. The proclamation urges Americans to reflect on the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime during World War II, including the murder of 6 million Jewish men, women, and children. It emphasizes the importance of preserving and sharing the stories of Holocaust victims to prevent such acts of evil from happening again. The proclamation also acknowledges the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps and condemns anti-Semitism and discrimination. President Trump asks the people of the United States to observe the Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust from April 19 to April 26, 2020, and to honor the memory of the victims through study, prayers, and commemoration.
