President Trump announced the implementation of Operation LeGend, a federal law enforcement surge in American cities plagued by violent crime. The operation aims to address the recent increase in violent crime and shootings in cities like Chicago, Philadelphia, and New York City. The surge will involve federal agencies such as the FBI, ATF, DEA, U.S. Marshals Service, and Homeland Security, working together with state and local law enforcement to combat violent crime. The President emphasized the importance of protecting the American people and restoring public safety. The operation is named after LeGend Taliferro, a four-year-old boy who was shot and killed in Kansas City. The Department of Justice will provide more than $61 million in grants to hire additional police officers in cities that are the focus of Operation LeGend. The operation is part of the administration's effort to support law enforcement and ensure the safety of communities across the country.
