The President has authorized the Department of Defense to send approximately 350 additional U.S. military personnel to protect diplomatic facilities and personnel in Baghdad, Iraq. This decision was made to support the Government of Iraq in its fight against ISIL and to ensure the safety of U.S. personnel and facilities in the region. These additional forces will not be involved in combat. The President is committed to providing necessary security for U.S. personnel and facilities worldwide. In addition to protecting personnel, the U.S. will continue to support the Government of Iraq's efforts to counter ISIL. The President will also consult with NATO allies to develop a comprehensive strategy and build a broad-based international coalition to fight against ISIL. Secretary Kerry, Secretary Hagel, and President Obama's counterterrorism advisor, Lisa Monaco, will be traveling to the region to strengthen regional partnerships.
