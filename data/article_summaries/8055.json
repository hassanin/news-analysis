Vice President Kamala Harris will host a meeting with Cabinet Secretaries and agency leaders to discuss the government's approach to addressing maternal mortality and morbidity. This meeting aims to bring together leaders from various federal agencies to address the maternal health crisis, including those that have not traditionally played a leading role in this area. In December 2021, Vice President Harris organized the first-ever federal Maternal Health Day of Action and announced a Call to Action to improve health outcomes for parents and infants in the United States. This resulted in investments from both the private and public sectors. The Administration is now taking further actions to address maternal health and combat the systemic inequities that contribute to worse outcomes for Black, Native American, and rural women. Vice President Harris has also introduced bills in the Senate, such as the Maternal CARE Act and the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act, aimed at addressing racial disparities in maternal mortality.
