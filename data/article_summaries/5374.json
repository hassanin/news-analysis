President Joe Biden recently held conversations with Walmart, Target, and infant formula manufacturers Reckitt and Gerber to discuss the shortage of infant formula caused by a voluntary recall by Abbott and the subsequent closure of its manufacturing facility. The manufacturers and retailers expressed gratitude for the actions taken by the Biden administration, enabling them to assist families in need. Reckitt and Gerber have been working to increase production and have already made up for a significant portion of Abbott's lost production. Both companies are operating 24/7 and have significantly increased the availability of their infant formula. The discussions with Walmart and Target focused on addressing disparities in stocking shelves, and the President offered assistance to move and distribute more products to communities in need. These conversations are part of ongoing efforts by the administration to increase the supply of infant formula since February.
