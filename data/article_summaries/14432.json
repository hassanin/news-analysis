The President has signed into law the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015, a bipartisan bill aimed at increasing pressure on the Hizballah terrorist organization. The law provides additional tools to target Hizballah's financial operations. The U.S. Government is working with Congress to maximize the effectiveness of these tools and disrupt Hizballah's support infrastructure. Strong actions, such as imposing sanctions, will be taken against Hizballah operatives and supporters wherever they are located.
