This article is a notice from the White House regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Burma. The President issued Executive Order 13047 on May 20, 1997, certifying that the Government of Burma has committed large-scale repression of the democratic opposition in Burma. This invoked a prohibition on new investment in Burma by United States persons. The President also declared a national emergency to address the threat posed to national security and foreign policy by the actions and policies of the Government of Burma. Additional steps were taken through Executive Orders 13310, 13448, and 13464 to further address the national emergency. The notice states that the actions and policies of the Government of Burma still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States, and therefore, the national emergency must continue beyond May 20, 2009.
