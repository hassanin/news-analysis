In his weekly message, President Obama emphasizes the importance of preventing and treating drug abuse, particularly the abuse of prescription medications. He highlights that each year, thousands of people in the US die from prescription drug overdoses, with many of these drugs coming from family medicine cabinets. He also points out that a significant portion of heroin users started by abusing prescription medications. To address this issue, the President encourages participation in the National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day, where individuals can safely dispose of expired or unnecessary prescription medications at designated collection sites in their communities. The President mentions that prescription drug disposal programs are part of his administration's Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Plan, which includes increasing education for those prescribing medications, expanding drug monitoring programs, and implementing smart law enforcement programs. He calls on everyone to continue working towards reducing addiction-related illnesses through evidence-based treatments, prevention, and recovery. The President emphasizes that prescription drug abuse is a significant problem that affects families and communities across the country and highlights the need for better approaches to addressing drug abuse, including treatment rather than incarceration. He calls on parents, medical professionals, and the entire country to play a role in reducing drug consumption and supporting those in need of treatment.
