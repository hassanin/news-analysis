Vice President Kamala Harris hosted a meeting with voting rights and civil rights leaders to discuss the importance of protecting the right to vote. The meeting allowed the Vice President to hear directly from leaders about their efforts to combat voter suppression and mobilize their networks. Over 360 bills have been introduced nationwide to restrict voting following the high voter turnout in the 2020 election. Harris reiterated her support for the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which aim to expand access to the ballot box and restore the protections of the Voting Rights Act. The Vice President stated that she and President Biden will continue to fight against voter suppression and work towards making voting easier and accessible for all Americans.
