Mexican security forces have arrested Néstor Isidro Pérez Salas, also known as "El Nini," the head of security for the Chapitos wing of the Sinaloa Cartel. El Nini has been wanted by both Mexico and the United States for nearly three years for his involvement in violence and illicit fentanyl trafficking. This arrest follows the extradition of another Chapitos leader, Ovidio Guzmán López, earlier this year. The collaboration between the United States and Mexico in capturing these criminals demonstrates their commitment to secure their communities and combat drug cartels. The arrest of El Nini is seen as a significant step in holding criminals accountable and ensuring public health and safety in both countries. The U.S. government expresses gratitude to President López Obrador, the Mexican Army, and the special forces for their effective capture of El Nini.
