The Trump administration has announced a new rule that allows consumers to purchase short-term health insurance plans for up to 12 months. This is seen as a major victory for young people and working families who have been struggling with the high costs of Obamacare plans. The average monthly premium for a 30-year-old purchasing a mid-level Silver Plan has increased by 31 percent in the past year, making it unaffordable for many. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services predicts that about 600,000 Americans will sign up for a new short-term health insurance plan next year, with that number expected to rise to 1.6 million by 2022. The average premium for a short-term plan is much lower than the cost of an Obamacare plan, making it a more viable option for many consumers, especially younger Americans. While there is still a need for Congress to pass a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, the Trump administration is working to provide affordable coverage for young people and working families.
