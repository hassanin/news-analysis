The leaders of Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States are marking the second anniversary of the announcement of AUKUS. The main focus of AUKUS has been to support Australia's acquisition of conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines. Progress has been made in this area, with Australian military personnel graduating from the U.S. nuclear power school and the USS North Carolina completing a port visit to Australia. The countries are also engaging with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and are committed to the highest non-proliferation standards. Cooperation on advanced capabilities has been deepened, with a focus on integrating scientists, industrial bases, and supply chains. Defense collaboration is being streamlined, and progress has been made in developing and demonstrating artificial intelligence and autonomous capabilities. The leaders emphasize the importance of legislative oversight and authorization to enable the success of AUKUS. The work under AUKUS reflects a commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific that is secure and stable, upholding the rules-based international order. The leaders recommit themselves to these values and look forward to continued progress in sustaining peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.
