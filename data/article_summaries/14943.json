The United States has strongly condemned the recent terrorist attack in Diyala Province, Iraq, carried out by ISIL. The attack targeted Iraqi civilians celebrating the Eid ul-Fitr holiday and is another example of the atrocities committed by ISIL against the people of Iraq. The United States remains committed to working with Prime Minister Al-Abadi and international partners to end ISIL's actions. They will continue to support the Government of Iraq and its security forces to degrade and ultimately destroy the terrorist organization.
