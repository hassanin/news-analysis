The White House is hosting a Summit on Working Families to address issues faced by working families and to set an agenda for a 21st century workplace. President Obama will announce a set of concrete steps that will create more opportunities for hardworking families to get ahead. These steps include signing a Presidential Memorandum to help families balance work and spending time at home, protecting pregnant working women, increasing investments for research on the economic benefits of paid leave, expanding apprenticeships for women, targeting resources to help women enter higher-paying STEM fields, and making child care more affordable for working families. The President's approach is grounded in his personal experience and the understanding that workplace policies need to be updated for the 21st century. The Summit will bring together businesses, economists, labor leaders, legislators, advocates, and the media to discuss issues facing working families. The President's actions are supported by reports released by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which explore topics such as work-life balance, paid and unpaid leave, and American families and work. The President is also taking steps to expand workplace flexibility, support pregnant workers, increase access to affordable child care, promote paid leave programs, and encourage women to enter non-traditional occupations. The Administration is also working to expand tax credits that support working families and partnering with the private sector to bring innovative solutions to more workplaces.
