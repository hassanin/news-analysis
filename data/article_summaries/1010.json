Rich Trumka, former president of the AFL-CIO, passed away recently, leaving behind a legacy as a champion for the dignity of the American worker. Trumka, who grew up in a coal mining family, dedicated his career to fighting for workers' rights, including wages, safety, and pensions. He believed that the middle class was the backbone of America, and that unions played a crucial role in building and sustaining it. Trumka was known for his fearlessness in speaking truth to power, even when it meant challenging those he had helped elect. His honesty, fairness, and trustworthiness made him a valued friend and ally. His passing is mourned by countless workers whose lives he improved, as well as by his family. President Joe Biden and his wife Jill expressed their condolences and admiration for Trumka, describing him as a dear friend, a great American, and a good man.
