President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation addressing the immigration and asylum system in the United States. The proclamation states that the mass migration of aliens across the southern border with Mexico has led to a crisis in the immigration system. As a result, the President has suspended and limited entry of such aliens through the southern border. The proclamation exempts aliens who entered the United States at a port of entry and properly presented for inspection, as well as lawful permanent residents. The President extended the suspension and limitation for an additional 90 days because the problem of large numbers of aliens traveling through Mexico to enter the US unlawfully has not improved. The situation along the southern border has continued to deteriorate, with an increase in inadmissible aliens attempting entry and a rise in Border Patrol apprehensions. The President mentions that a nationwide injunction issued by a US District Court judge has hampered the ability to address these problems. The President emphasizes the need to protect the national interest and maintain an effective asylum system for legitimate asylum seekers. The suspension and limitation on entry will remain in place until relief is obtained from all injunctions preventing full implementation of an interim final rule. The proclamation also includes provisions on the scope and implementation of the suspension, consultations with the Government of Mexico, severability, and general provisions.
