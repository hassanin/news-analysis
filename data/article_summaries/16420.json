The White House Press Secretary released a statement regarding the passage of H.R. 719, stating that Congress has taken a step away from crisis by passing the bill. The President will sign the bill into law once he receives it. However, the statement emphasizes that the American people deserve better than last-minute, short-term legislating. It calls on Congress to pass a budget that reverses harmful spending cuts and allows for critical investments in areas such as military readiness, infrastructure, schools, public health, and research and development. The statement urges Congress to act without delay and not to postpone important decisions. It emphasizes that Washington should choose to support the American comeback and not stall its momentum.
