President Biden addressed the issue of student debt during a press conference in the Roosevelt Room. He highlighted the increasing cost of education beyond high school and the burden it places on students and their families. The President announced several actions his administration will take to address this issue. First, the pause on student loan payments will be extended until December 31, 2022. Second, $10,000 of outstanding federal student loans will be forgiven, and students from low-income families who qualify for Pell Grants will have their debt reduced by $20,000. These relief measures will primarily benefit working and middle-class families making under $125,000 per year. The President also outlined plans to improve the student loan system, including implementing an income-driven repayment plan and fixing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. He emphasized the need to hold colleges accountable for rising costs without delivering value to students. The President acknowledged that not everyone will be pleased with these measures but believes they are responsible and fair. He expressed his commitment to making college more affordable and expanding opportunities for education.
