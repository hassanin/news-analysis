National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice met with Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Alberto Figueiredo to address concerns about intelligence collection activities allegedly undertaken by the United States. The meeting was part of an ongoing dialogue between the two countries, which have a strong partnership based on shared interests as multicultural democracies and major economies. The United States and Brazil have a significant trade relationship, with over $100 billion in bilateral trade in goods and services in 2012. Both countries are also collaborating on various global issues such as international peace and security, energy, global financial issues, and food security. President Obama has stated that his national security team is conducting a review of U.S. intelligence activities to ensure they align with policy decisions and national interests. Rice acknowledged that recent press disclosures have strained the bilateral relationship with Brazil and expressed the United States' commitment to addressing these concerns while continuing to collaborate on shared initiatives.
