President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to North Korea will continue beyond June 26, 2021. This national emergency was initially declared in 2008 and has been expanded and addressed in several executive orders since then. The President believes that the existence and risk of weapons usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula, along with North Korea's actions and policies that destabilize the region and threaten the United States and its allies, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy. Therefore, he has determined that it is necessary to maintain the national emergency.
