President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has notified Congress that the national emergency with respect to Cuba, which was declared on March 1, 1996, will continue beyond March 1, 2021. The decision is based on the disturbance or threatened disturbance of international relations related to Cuba. Unauthorized entry of U.S.-registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters is deemed detrimental to U.S. foreign policy and violates federal law. Allowing large-scale unauthorized entries could facilitate a mass migration of Cuban nationals, posing a threat to national security. Therefore, President Biden has determined it necessary to continue the national emergency and maintain emergency authority regarding the regulation of vessel anchorage and movement.
