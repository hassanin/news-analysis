The Biden-Harris Administration has announced new actions to support the electric vehicle (EV) charging industry in the United States. These actions aim to create a national network of 500,000 EV chargers by 2030 and increase the share of EVs in new car sales to at least 50% by the same year. The administration's infrastructure law includes $7.5 billion for EV charging, $10 billion for clean transportation, and over $7 billion for EV battery components and materials. The private sector has also invested over $100 billion in EV, battery, and charging manufacturing in the US. Today's announcements include the Department of Transportation's $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program to create a coast-to-coast network of chargers along major highways. New national standards for federally funded EV chargers have also been unveiled to ensure a user-friendly and reliable charging experience. Several companies, including Tesla, General Motors, and EVgo, have committed to expanding their charging networks with thousands of new public charging ports in the next two years. The announcements aim to support American manufacturing, create jobs, and accelerate the transition to cleaner transportation.
