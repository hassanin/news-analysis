The article highlights the anniversary of the Supreme Court's recognition of a woman's constitutional right to make personal decisions regarding her health with her doctor, free from political interference. It criticizes the Court's recent decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, resulting in the enactment of extreme and dangerous abortion bans in many states. The author blames Republican elected officials for endangering women's health and lives by imposing restrictions on reproductive freedom. Despite public opposition to these measures, Republican officials are still pushing for a national ban and additional restrictions. The Vice President and the author are committed to defending women's reproductive freedom and urge Congress to restore the protections of Roe through federal law.
