President Obama issued a statement welcoming the signing of a political agreement in Yemen, brokered by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The agreement calls for the formation of a government of national unity within 14 days and early presidential elections within 90 days. President Ali Abdullah Saleh has made the decision to transfer executive powers immediately to the Vice President in accordance with the agreement. This is seen as a significant step forward for the Yemeni people, who have been demanding change for the past ten months. The United States urges all parties to implement the terms of the agreement and supports Yemen in addressing its challenges and moving towards a more secure and prosperous future. The United States also acknowledges the important role played by its GCC partners in facilitating this agreement.
