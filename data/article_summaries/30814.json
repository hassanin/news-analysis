This article is a presidential memorandum issued by President Donald Trump on April 29, 2019, regarding additional measures to enhance border security and restore integrity to the immigration system. The memorandum acknowledges the crisis at the southern border caused by mass migration and declares a national emergency to address the security and humanitarian issues. The purpose of the memorandum is to strengthen asylum procedures to prevent abuse of the system. The policy outlined in the memorandum aims to manage humanitarian immigration programs in a safe and orderly manner, granting relief or protection to eligible aliens and denying benefits to those who do not qualify. The memorandum instructs the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to propose regulations within 90 days to ensure that aliens who receive positive fear determinations are placed in appropriate proceedings and that all asylum applications receive final administrative adjudication within 180 days. It also proposes setting fees for asylum applications and initial applications for employment authorization, as well as barring unauthorized aliens from receiving employment authorization and revoking it for those denied asylum or subject to a final removal order. The Secretary of Homeland Security is directed to reprioritize the assignment of immigration officers to improve the integrity of credible and reasonable fear claims, enforce immigration laws, and ensure compliance with removal orders. The memorandum concludes with general provisions stating that it does not impair the authority of executive departments or agencies, and it must be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to appropriations.
