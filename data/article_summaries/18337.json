The article is a transcript of a speech given by the President of the United States, discussing progress made in three areas to repair the damage caused by the recession and build a stronger foundation for the future. 

The first area of progress is the enactment of a Wall Street reform law that aims to protect consumers and the economy from irresponsible practices. This reform will end abusive practices by mortgage lenders and credit card companies, bring transparency to financial dealings, and give shareholders a say in executive compensation. 

The second area of progress is the enactment of a law that will enable the government to take strict measures against improper payments. This law will help save billions of taxpayer dollars by preventing payments to companies that haven't paid taxes, prisoners, or deceased individuals. 

The third area of progress is the resumption of unemployment insurance for approximately 2.5 million Americans who are jobless and seeking employment. 

The President emphasizes the importance of passing additional measures to cut taxes and increase lending to small businesses, which are crucial for job creation and economic growth. He highlights the need for a small business bill that will create a new loan fund to help community banks provide loans to small business owners and increase lending to industries heavily impacted by the recession. The President also proposes eliminating capital gains taxes for investments in small businesses to promote their growth. 

The President expresses gratitude to the senators who have supported these measures, but urges the Senate to quickly pass the small business bill without further partisan disputes. He emphasizes the need to prioritize the best interests of the country and its citizens, rather than engaging in endless political campaigns. The President concludes by urging the Congress to govern and make progress before the August recess.
