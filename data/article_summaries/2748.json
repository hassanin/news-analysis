On September 12, 2018, President Biden declared a national emergency in response to the threat of foreign interference in United States elections. The declaration was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, as there were concerns about foreign powers exploiting America's political system. Although there has been no evidence of a foreign power altering election outcomes, the proliferation of digital devices and internet-based communications has increased the vulnerability to foreign interference. This national emergency, initially declared in 2018, has been extended for another year until September 12, 2022. The continuation of the national emergency is based on the ongoing threat posed by unauthorized accessing of election infrastructure, covert propaganda, and disinformation. This notice has been published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
