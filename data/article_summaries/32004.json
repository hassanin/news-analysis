The Trump Administration has been successful in rolling back regulations, cutting nearly eight regulations for every new significant regulation implemented. This approach is estimated to increase real incomes by over $3,100 per household per year and save consumers and businesses over $220 billion annually. Additionally, the Safer Affordable Fuel Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles initiative is expected to reduce the price of new vehicles by $2,200 by 2026. These deregulatory efforts are projected to increase the real incomes of Americans by $53 billion per year from 2021 to 2029. Casey Mulligan, former Chief Economist at the Council of Economic Advisers, has shown that these deregulatory actions have particularly benefited the bottom 20 percent of income distribution, with potential savings of nearly 15 percent for this group. The reduction in regulations has contributed to a strong labor market and economy, lifting millions of Americans out of poverty and reducing reliance on food stamps. President Trump's commitment to further deregulatory measures aims to ensure continued prosperity for American workers and families.
