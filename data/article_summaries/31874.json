President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are quietly reshaping the federal judiciary by confirming a record number of appellate judges. The Senate has already confirmed 24 appellate judges since Trump took office, the highest number for a president's first two years in office. This has significant implications as the 13 circuit courts will influence decisions on various issues such as immigration, voting rights, abortion, and the environment. With 13 vacancies to fill, Trump and the Republicans have the power to install more than 20 percent of the judges on the nation's second-highest courts. The Senate plans to confirm two more federal appeals court judges this week.
