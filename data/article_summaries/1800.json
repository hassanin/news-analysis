The United States and the United Arab Emirates have signed a clean energy framework called the U.S.-UAE Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE). The partnership aims to catalyze $100 billion in financing, investment, and support to deploy 100 gigawatts of clean energy globally by 2035. PACE is built upon four pillars: clean energy innovation, carbon and methane management, nuclear energy, and industrial and transport decarbonization. The U.S. and UAE will establish an expert group to identify priority projects and measure PACE's progress. Additionally, the two countries plan to prioritize investment in clean energy in developing and low-income countries and provide them with technical and financial assistance. PACE will also focus on reducing carbon dioxide and methane emissions, promoting advanced nuclear energy, and tackling decarbonization in industrial and transportation sectors.
