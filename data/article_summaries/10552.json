This article announces the continuation of a national emergency with respect to the situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The President declared this national emergency in 2006 and ordered measures blocking the property of certain individuals contributing to the conflict in the country. The emergency was declared due to the widespread violence and atrocities that threatened regional stability. Since the situation still poses a threat to the foreign policy of the United States, the national emergency and the measures adopted will continue beyond October 27, 2011, for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
