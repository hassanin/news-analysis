Vice President Joe Biden visited the War Memorial of Korea in Seoul, where he laid a wreath and expressed his gratitude for the brave Americans who sacrificed their lives for the freedom of the Korean people. He was moved to see the names of Delawareans on the memorial, including the father of a high school friend. Biden also mentioned that North Korea had released an American citizen, Mr. Newman, who should have never been held in the first place. Biden offered Newman a ride home on Air Force Two, but Newman opted to take a direct flight to San Francisco instead. Biden called for the release of another American citizen, Mr. Bae, who is still being held in North Korea. When asked if he played a role in securing Newman's release, Biden said he had no direct involvement.
