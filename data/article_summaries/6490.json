Jill and I are sending our best wishes to those celebrating Nowruz around the world. Nowruz is a holiday that brings families together to reflect on the past year and look forward to the future. This year, it is especially important to have hope, particularly for the women in Iran who are fighting for their rights and freedoms. The United States will continue to support them and hold Iranian officials accountable for their actions. We have decorated our Haft-Sin table at the White House to symbolize our hopes for the new year, and we celebrate the diverse diaspora communities in America who contribute to our nation. We wish everyone celebrating a peaceful and prosperous new year.
