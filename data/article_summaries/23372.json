On May 20, 2009, President Obama signed two important pieces of legislation: the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act and the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act. The Helping Families Save Their Homes Act aims to stabilize and reform the nation's financial and housing markets, helping American homeowners stay in their homes and increasing the flow of credit during difficult economic times. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act provides the federal government with new tools and resources to prevent fraud, ensuring that markets remain free and fair for American consumers. The Helping Families Save Their Homes Act includes provisions to expand the reach of the Making Home Affordable Program, improve the Hope for Homeowners program, make modifications to FHA and federally guaranteed farm loans, and increase the flow of credit by expanding the capabilities of the FDIC and NCUA. It also establishes protections for renters living in foreclosed homes and ensures that homeowners know who owns their mortgage. The legislation also provides comprehensive new resources for homeless Americans. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act strengthens the capacity of federal prosecutors and regulators to hold accountable those who have committed fraud. It covers private mortgage brokers and other companies that are not currently covered under federal bank fraud criminal statutes. The law also prohibits the manipulation of the mortgage lending business, protects the integrity of TARP and the Recovery Act, and broadens the scope of the False Claims Act. Additionally, the legislation provides resources to investigate and prosecute fraudulent schemes and establishes a bipartisan Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission to investigate the causes of the financial crisis.
