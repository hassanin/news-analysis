On May 16, 2012, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. declared a national emergency in response to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Yemen and others that posed a threat to Yemen's peace, security, and stability. This national emergency was declared under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The President has determined that the threat continues to exist and therefore, the national emergency declared in 2012 must continue beyond May 16, 2021. In accordance with the National Emergencies Act, the President is extending the national emergency for one year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
