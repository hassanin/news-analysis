Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz briefed reporters on Air Force One en route to Springfield, Illinois. President Obama was heading to Springfield to mark the nine-year anniversary of his announcement of his candidacy for president. Schultz mentioned that the President would address the General Assembly of the Illinois State Senate and discuss his time in the state senate as an example of working across party lines. The President would also talk about making it easier for people to vote and acknowledge that change is not easy but still possible. Schultz also mentioned that Valerie Jarrett had annotated the President's 2007 speech on WhiteHouse.gov, highlighting the progress made during his administration. Schultz did not have any reaction from the President regarding the primary results in New Hampshire but stated that the process would go on for some time. He expressed confidence that the Clean Power Plan rule, which the Supreme Court dealt a blow to, would eventually prevail and that the U.S. would fulfill its commitments on climate change. Schultz also mentioned that the President would talk about improving politics and discourse, and that the President had been updated on the methane leak in California. He did not have any reaction to the North Korea sanctions bill or the victory of Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire. Schultz mentioned that the President was aware of the energy Sanders had tapped into and that voters were frustrated with Washington. The President would discuss discourse and civility in his remarks and would look forward to making politics more responsive to citizens. On the trip to Springfield, Senator Durbin, Congresswoman Duckworth, Congresswoman Kelly, and Congressman Quigley were traveling on Air Force One, along with former White House staff and campaign officials. Current Clinton staffers were not on the plane, but Schultz did not know if they would attend the event.
