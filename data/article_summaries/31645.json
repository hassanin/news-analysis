President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed September 28, 2019, as National Hunting and Fishing Day in the United States. The proclamation recognizes the enduring pastimes of hunting and fishing, which have been a part of American culture since the earliest days of the nation. Hunting and fishing have played a vital role in providing for families and passing on the traditions to future generations. The proclamation also highlights the contributions of hunters and anglers to conservation efforts and the economy. Wildlife-related recreation supports hundreds of thousands of jobs and millions of Americans participate in hunting and fishing activities. The administration is committed to expanding access to hunting and fishing opportunities and has opened or expanded access to nearly 1.8 million acres of lands and waters. The proclamation encourages all Americans to appreciate the natural beauty of the United States and recognize the contributions of hunters, anglers, and those who work to conserve the nation's fish and wildlife resources.
