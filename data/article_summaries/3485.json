In a press briefing, Deputy Director of the National Economic Policy Council Bharat Ramamurti discussed the economic impact of the Biden administration's student loan plan. He highlighted that the plan will benefit working middle-class families and lift a large weight off of tens of millions of Americans who are currently burdened by student loan debt. He emphasized that relieving this debt will not only benefit individuals and their families, but also the communities they live in and the overall economy. Ramamurti also addressed concerns about the cost of the proposal, stating that the estimated debt relief would reduce average annual receipts in the student loan program by about $24 billion a year over the next 10 years. He explained that this reduction in revenue is due to the forgiveness and reduction of outstanding loan balances. He emphasized that this cost represents a small portion of the deficit reduction projected for this fiscal year and is far less than the amount forgiven under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) since last July. Ramamurti also mentioned that the official budgetary score will be produced by the Education Department and the Office of Management and Budget in the coming weeks.
