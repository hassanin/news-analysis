President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Hawaii in response to the volcanic eruption and lava flow that began on September 4, 2014. This declaration allows federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Federal funding will be available for emergency protective measures and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. Kenneth K. Suiso has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments.
