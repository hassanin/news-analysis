In a teleconference, a senior administration official announced that the Vice President will participate virtually in the Pacific Islands Forum leaders' meeting on July 12th. The United States is not a member of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), but the Vice President has been invited by Fijian Prime Minister Bainimarama to address the PIF leaders, highlighting the longstanding partnership between the United States and the Pacific Islands.

As part of a new chapter in the relationship, the United States plans to significantly increase its presence in the Pacific Islands. The deliverables include discussions to establish new U.S. embassies in Kiribati and Tonga, the appointment of the first-ever U.S. envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum, bringing back the Peace Corps to the Pacific, reestablishing a regional mission in Suva, Fiji, and tripling U.S. funding for economic development and ocean resilience in the region.

The official emphasized that the United States is not seeking to counter any specific country, such as China, but rather focusing on positive engagement with the Pacific Islands. They also addressed concerns about climate pledges, stating that the United States remains committed to the Paris Climate Agreement and will provide support for climate adaptation and resilience in the Pacific Islands.

Regarding regional security, the official mentioned the administration's interest in engaging throughout the Indo-Pacific and supporting the Pacific Islands through initiatives like the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, AUKUS, and the new partnership for the Blue Pacific. They expressed concern about Kiribati's reported decision to withdraw from the PIF and emphasized the importance of a united PIF to address the climate crisis.

The call concluded with a reminder that the information shared is embargoed until July 12th, 5:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
