Hurricanes Harvey and Irma had a significant impact on the US economy, specifically in terms of employment and industrial production. September job growth was only 18,000, significantly lower than the average growth of the first eight months of the year. However, there was a large rebound in job growth in October, with 261,000 jobs added. The hurricanes also affected industrial production, particularly in the oil refineries, petrochemical plants, and plastic facilities, as well as petroleum and natural gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. The Federal Reserve estimates that the hurricanes reduced industrial production growth by 0.65 percentage point in August and 0.15 percentage point in September. This translates to a 1.9 percentage point reduction in third-quarter growth of industrial production at an annual rate, which directly impacts GDP. The estimated loss of industrial production accounts for a 0.3 percentage point reduction in third-quarter real GDP growth at an annual rate. Additionally, the hurricanes caused significant dislocation of employees, with an estimated 2 million people missing a week of work in Texas and Louisiana due to Hurricane Harvey, and 4 million people missing a week of work in Florida due to Hurricane Irma. This could result in a further 0.6 percentage point reduction in GDP growth. However, it is important to note that these estimates may overestimate the effects on GDP growth, as the Texas, Louisiana, and Florida economies have shown resilience, and some effects may already be included in the estimates for industrial production. Other economic forecasters have placed the negative effects on annual average real GDP growth in a similar range, with estimates ranging from 0.8 to 2.9 percentage points. The Department of Commerce estimates property losses of $121 billion in the private sector and $10 billion in the government sectors, which do not directly affect GDP.
