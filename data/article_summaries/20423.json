First Lady Michelle Obama has announced a new effort to make it easier for people to find and share healthier recipes. Five of America's largest media companies, including Cond√© Nast, Hearst Magazines, Meredith, Food Network, and Time, Inc., along with Pinterest, are collaborating to compile and promote thousands of nutritious recipes that align with the USDA's MyPlate guidelines for healthier eating. These recipes will be labeled, compiled, and promoted on their popular cooking websites, which collectively received 150 million views in January alone. Over 3,000 recipes have been identified across 18 websites, and nearly 1,000 of them have been collected on a new Pinterest page associated with the effort. This initiative aims to provide a one-stop-shop for parents, beginner home cooks, and experienced chefs to find and share healthier recipes. The participating publications include Allrecipes.com, Better Homes & Gardens, CookingLight.com, CountryLiving.com, Delish.com, DiabeticlivingOnline.com, EatingWell.com, Epicurious.com, Everyday with Rachael Ray, FamilyCircle.com, FoodNetwork.com, GoodHousekeeping.com, MyRecipes.com, Parents.com, RealSimple.com, Redbook.com, Recipe.com, and Woman'sDay.com.
