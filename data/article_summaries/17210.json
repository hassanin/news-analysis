President Obama announced the next steps in developing a new urban and metropolitan agenda. This includes a national conversation to engage cities and metropolitan areas, a review of federal policies impacting local communities, and visits by administration officials to cities and metropolitan areas across the country. The goal is to strengthen the partnership between federal and local governments and consider innovative ideas that improve people's lives. The Office of Management and Budget, along with other White House offices, will conduct an internal audit of specific policies and work with agencies to coordinate federal policies and funding. The aim is to invest in what works and put an end to ineffective practices. These initiatives build on the work done by The White House to develop a new urban policy vision focused on opportunity and possibility. President Obama emphasized the importance of seizing this moment to make cities and people stronger.
