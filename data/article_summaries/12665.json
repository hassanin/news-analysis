President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of New Hampshire and authorized federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following Tropical Storm Irene. The federal funding will be used for emergency work, repairing or replacing damaged facilities, and implementing hazard mitigation measures. The affected counties include Carroll, Coos, Grafton, and Merrimack, but additional counties may receive assistance once damage assessments are completed. Albert Lewis has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the area. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
