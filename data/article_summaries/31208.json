The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) has launched the Opioid Detection Challenge, a global prize competition with a $1.55 million USD prize pool. The challenge is a collaboration between DHS S&T, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS). The competition aims to find innovative and rapid detection tools to locate illicit opioids being trafficked into the United States through international mail. The abuse of opioids, including fentanyl, has led to a public health crisis in the country, with approximately 50,000 Americans dying from opioid overdoses in 2017. The challenge calls on innovators in various fields to submit plans for automated, user-friendly tools and technologies that can detect opioids in parcels without disrupting the flow of mail. The deadline for plan submissions is April 24, 2019, and finalists will have the opportunity to compete for additional cash prizes in the prototype development stage.
