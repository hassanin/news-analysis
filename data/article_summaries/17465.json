The White House has issued a notice stating that they will not be rescinding unobligated funds under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The decision was made based on the fact that the Inspectors General overseeing investigations often require multiple years to complete their work, and in some cases, the awards they oversee will continue past December 31, 2012. The unobligated balance of $11.5 million will provide the Inspectors General with the flexibility needed to combat waste, fraud, and abuse. This notice will be published in the Federal Register.
