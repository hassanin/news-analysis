Deputy National Security Advisor Matt Pottinger delivered a speech on U.S.-China relations, highlighting the historic May Fourth Movement in China. The movement, which began on May 4, 1919, was a protest by university students against China's unfair treatment at the Paris Peace Conference after World War I. Pottinger discussed the movement's call for a transformation of Chinese politics, society, and culture, as well as the key figures who embodied its spirit. He mentioned Hu Shih, who advocated for a written language that reflected the voices of living Chinese people, and P.C. Chang, who contributed to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pottinger also praised Dr. Li Wenliang, who warned about the coronavirus outbreak and was silenced by authorities. He highlighted the bravery of individuals who continue to pursue democratic ideals in China today. Pottinger concluded by suggesting that China could benefit from a little less nationalism and a little more populism, emphasizing the importance of citizen-centric government.
