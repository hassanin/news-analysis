Significant progress has been made in Iraq this week with regards to energy deals that enhance the country's sovereignty, independence, and economic prosperity. Firstly, the Iraqi government and the Kurdistan Regional Government have reached a historic agreement on oil exports and revenue management through the Iraq-Turkey Pipeline. This agreement sets the stage for a multi-year budget and a long-term hydrocarbons law to ensure stability in Iraq's energy sector. Secondly, Iraq has secured a groundbreaking $27 billion deal with France's TotalEnergies, including a project to capture and utilize flared gas in southern Iraq. This project will increase electricity supply, promote energy self-sufficiency, reduce climate impact, and allow for the export of gas products to new markets. Companies from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United States will also contribute to this infrastructure project. The United States is proud to support these initiatives and other diplomatic efforts that aim to foster a more stable and prosperous Middle East, benefiting both the region and the American people.
