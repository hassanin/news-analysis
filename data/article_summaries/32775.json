President Donald Trump has signed into law the "Study of Underrepresented Classes Chasing Engineering and Science Success Act of 2018" or the "SUCCESS Act". The Act extends the authority of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to set patent and trademark fees for 8 years. It also requires a report on patents issued to certain groups. Section 3 of the Act requires the Director of the USPTO to submit legislative recommendations to Congress. President Trump states that his administration will treat this provision in a manner consistent with Article II, section 3 of the Constitution, which gives the President the discretion to recommend to Congress only measures he deems necessary and expedient.
