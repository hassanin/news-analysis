The White House has announced that this year's Easter Egg Roll will feature costume characters from various children's shows and movies. The event, which promotes health and wellness, is part of the First Lady's Let's Move! initiative to combat childhood obesity. The activities at the Easter Egg Roll, including sports, dancing, and cooking, aim to encourage children to lead healthy and active lives. The event will take place on the South Lawn of the White House, and updates on the talent participating in the event will be shared on the Let's Move! Twitter account and Facebook page. The Easter Egg Roll is a long-standing tradition, and souvenir White House Easter eggs have been available since 1981. This year, there is even an official First Dog "Bo" egg. The event will be live-streamed on April 9th, 2012, and more information can be found on the White House website and Let's Move! social media accounts.
