The White House announced that hearing aids will now be available over-the-counter without a prescription, which will lower the cost by as much as $3,000 for adults with mild to moderate hearing loss. Retailers such as Walgreens, CVS, Best Buy, Walmart, and Hy-Vee will start selling these hearing aids in-store and online. President Biden's executive order on competition called for the FDA to make this change, and it is now a reality. The White House also confirmed that President Biden will welcome President Herzog of Israel to the White House on October 26 to discuss regional and global challenges and ways to advance freedom, prosperity, and security for both Israelis and Palestinians. 

In the press briefing, the White House condemned former President Trump's recent antisemitic comments, stating that his comments were insulting to Jews and our Israeli allies. The White House called for the rooting out of antisemitism everywhere and emphasized the strong relationship between the United States and Israel.

The press briefing also touched on other topics such as President Biden's upcoming trips to Pennsylvania and Florida, his support for Democratic candidates in the midterm elections, Russia's drone strikes against Kyiv, the UK's economic plan, and the President's remarks on abortion rights. The White House did not provide specific details on future travel plans or the timeline for cost savings from the hearing aids.
