During a press briefing aboard Air Force One, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany and Acting Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan discussed the progress of the border wall. McEnany stated that over 200 miles of the wall have been built, while critics argue that only a few miles are actually new barriers. Morgan defended the construction, stating that all 220 miles of the wall system are brand new and provide enhanced capabilities with integrated technology and accessories. The briefing also touched on President Trump's comments about slowing down COVID-19 testing, with McEnany clarifying that he was being sarcastic and emphasizing the importance of testing. The potential for an executive order on statues and the upcoming Balkan peace talks were also mentioned, with McEnany promising to provide more information later. The briefing concluded with praise for Hogan Gidley, a member of the Trump administration.
