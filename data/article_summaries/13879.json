The White House press briefing by Secretary of the Treasury Tim Geithner on March 23, 2009, discussed the next stage of the plan to repair the financial system. Geithner emphasized the need to move aggressively to restore the financial system and provide the credit necessary for economic recovery. He outlined several critical parts of the financial agenda, including targeted programs to address the housing crisis and small business lending, as well as a plan to ensure banks have enough capital to survive a deeper recession. The briefing also announced an innovative plan to create a market for legacy assets, such as loans and securities, which are currently causing uncertainty and hindering the financial system. The plan involves a financing mechanism for banks to sell pools of loans and for investors to sell and purchase securities, with capital from the government and private investors. The goal is to clean up bank balance sheets, increase lending capacity, reduce liquidity risk, and lower borrowing costs. The briefing addressed concerns about the pricing and terms of the program, as well as potential risks and the need to balance the interests of taxpayers and investors. Geithner also discussed the importance of international support and the consensus on the need for strong stimulus, financial system strengthening, and financial reforms. Overall, the briefing aimed to provide an overview of the plan and its objectives, as well as address potential concerns and questions.
