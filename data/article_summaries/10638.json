The Obama Administration, along with various organizations and companies, has announced a new set of actions to reduce the organ waiting list in the United States. These actions include increasing the number of people who register as organ donors, increasing the number of transplants, and facilitating breakthrough research and development. The Administration has already taken steps to improve outcomes for individuals waiting for organ transplants, such as legalizing the use of organs from HIV-positive donors for HIV-positive recipients and launching a nationwide kidney paired donation program. The new actions announced aim to further enhance these efforts. Some of the key actions include investing in research and development with almost $200 million, creating a new Advanced Tissue Biofabrication Manufacturing Innovation Institute, and launching a potential Kidney Disease XPRIZE. The Administration also aims to close the gap between the number of Americans who support organ donation and those who are registered as organ donors. More than 20 entities, including Facebook, Tinder, and Twitter, have committed to help increase organ donor registrations. Additionally, the Administration plans to invest in clinical research and innovation to improve outcomes for patients and increase the number of transplants. This includes collaborating with transplant centers to share data and best practices and launching a multicenter study of HIV-positive to HIV-positive organ transplants. The ultimate goal is to reduce the organ waiting list and improve access to life-saving organ transplants. The Administration will provide an update in the next 180 days outlining further steps to achieve these goals.
