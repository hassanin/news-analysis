President Barack Obama has submitted a message to the Senate, transmitting the Protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of Montenegro for advice and consent to ratification. The Protocol, signed on May 19, 2016, allows Montenegro to become a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Montenegro's accession to NATO will demonstrate the Alliance's commitment to its Open Door policy and the Euro-Atlantic integration of the Balkans. President Obama urges the Senate to provide prompt advice and consent to ratification and assures them of his administration's readiness to assist in their deliberations.
