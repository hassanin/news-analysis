The Supreme Court's recent order allowing the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) to remain in effect is seen as a major victory for the Trump Administration. The MPP, which implements a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act, has been instrumental in controlling illegal migration, smuggling, and human trafficking along the southern border. The decision is seen as preventing chaos at the border, reducing public health threats, and protecting foreign relations. The administration emphasizes the importance of enforcing border and airport laws and believes that open borders are not in the best interest of the American public.
