President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13851, regarding the situation in Nicaragua, is to continue beyond November 27, 2019. The President cites the violent response by the Nicaraguan government to protests, the dismantling of democratic institutions, the use of violence against civilians, and corruption leading to economic destabilization as reasons for the continuation of the national emergency.
