The Vice President of the United States visited the Joint Security Area Landing Zone in Paju-si, Republic of Korea. He emphasized the strong and enduring alliance between the two countries, demonstrated by US soldiers training alongside soldiers from the Republic of Korea. The commitment of the United States to the defense of the Republic of Korea is ironclad, including extended deterrence supported by the full range of US military capabilities. Both countries share the goal of complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The Vice President also highlighted the history of the alliance, forged during the Korean War, and the ongoing threat of conflict in the region. He expressed gratitude for the brave soldiers serving at the DMZ and acknowledged the stark contrast between the thriving democracy in the south and the brutal dictatorship in the north. The United States and the world seek a stable and peaceful Korean Peninsula where the DPRK is no longer a threat.
