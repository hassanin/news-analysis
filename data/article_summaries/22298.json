In this memorandum, President Barack Obama directs various departments and agencies to take action regarding Iceland's trade in whale meat and products. The Secretary of the Interior has already certified that Icelandic nationals are engaging in trade that diminishes the effectiveness of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The President expresses concern and instructs relevant departments and agencies to raise concerns with Iceland's trade in appropriate CITES fora, seek additional measures to reduce such trade, and enhance the effectiveness of CITES. The President also directs senior Administration officials to raise objections to commercial whaling and urge a halt to such action in meetings with Icelandic officials. Additionally, the President instructs the Department of State and other relevant departments and agencies to encourage Iceland to develop nonlethal uses of whales, such as responsible whale watching and scientific research activities. The Department of State is directed to re-examine bilateral cooperation projects and base cooperation on Iceland changing its whaling policy and not engaging in trade that diminishes the effectiveness of CITES. The United States will continue to monitor the activities of Icelandic companies engaged in commercial whaling and trade in whale parts and products. Cabinet secretaries and other senior Administration officials are instructed to evaluate the appropriateness of visits to Iceland in light of its resumption of fin whaling. Finally, the President directs relevant departments and agencies to explore other options for responding to continued whaling by Iceland. Departments and agencies are expected to make progress on these actions and report to the President within six months. The President emphasizes the need for continued focus on Icelandic whaling activities to encourage Iceland to stop commercial whaling and support international conservation efforts.
