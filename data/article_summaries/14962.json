This article is a Presidential Proclamation by Barack Obama, marking the anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) on July 26, 2016. The ADA was enacted in 1990 and aimed to eliminate discrimination against people with disabilities in various areas of life, including education, employment, and public services. The proclamation highlights the progress made since the ADA's implementation, such as increased employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities and improved access to healthcare. However, it also acknowledges that there is still work to be done, such as addressing unemployment rates and improving accessibility in information and communication technologies. The proclamation concludes by encouraging Americans to celebrate the 26th anniversary of the ADA and recognize the contributions of individuals with disabilities.
