The United States congratulates the Government of Colombia on reaching a revised peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. The progress made is seen as a commitment from all sides to ending the 52-year conflict and building a just and lasting peace in Colombia. President Juan Manuel Santos is commended for forming an inclusive national dialogue to address concerns of those who voted against the initial peace agreement. The negotiations have been difficult and complicated, and while the new provisions are seen as an important step forward, they may not satisfy everyone. The United States intends to continue its bipartisan support to Colombia through the Peace Colombia framework and the Global Demining Initiative for Colombia.
