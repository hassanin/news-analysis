On October 19, 2011, the White House issued a notice regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia. This national emergency was initially declared on October 21, 1995, by President Clinton through Executive Order 12978. It was declared under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to address the threat posed by Colombian narcotics traffickers to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The extreme level of violence, corruption, and harm caused by these traffickers in the United States and abroad necessitates the continuation of this national emergency. Therefore, President Obama has decided to extend the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
