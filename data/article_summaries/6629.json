The White House has formed a Climate Innovation Working Group as part of its efforts to address the climate crisis and create jobs. The group will help coordinate federal government-wide initiatives to develop affordable and game-changing technologies that can contribute to achieving President Biden's goal of net zero emissions by 2050. It will be co-chaired by the White House Office of Domestic Climate Policy, Office of Science of Technology and Policy, and Office of Management and Budget. The U.S. Department of Energy has also announced a $100 million funding opportunity to support research into low-carbon energy technologies. The funding is aimed at encouraging interdisciplinary approaches and collaboration across sectors. The Climate Innovation Working Group will also focus on strengthening American manufacturing and building critical clean energy supply chains.
