The Trump Administration has announced that the number of health insurance issuers offering Obamacare plans for 2018 is only half as many as in 2016. This decline means that many Americans who had coverage will not be able to keep their plans. The Administration believes that decisive action from Congress is needed to protect Americans from the failure of Obamacare. The current system forces Americans to choose from fewer options or pay the IRS for the right to go without insurance, limiting their access to doctors and healthcare services. This puts a burden on individuals and families, especially those in need of quality coverage.
