In the proclamation, he honors all American citizens of Hispanic descent and celebrates their traditions of faith, family, hard work, and patriotism. He expresses gratitude for the contributions Hispanics make to society, particularly the 1.2 million Hispanic-American men and women who serve in the Armed Forces. Trump highlights his administration's efforts to create opportunities for all citizens to achieve the American Dream, such as tax cuts, eliminating regulations, and fixing trade deals. He also emphasizes the importance of strengthening relationships with Latin American neighbors and promoting liberty in the region. Trump calls upon public officials, educators, librarians, and all Americans to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
