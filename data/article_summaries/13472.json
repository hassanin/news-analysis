The United States is expressing deep concern over the restrictions placed on foreign journalists in China, including delays in processing visas, travel restrictions to sensitive areas, and instances of violence. These restrictions are not in line with freedom of the press and are in stark contrast to how the US treats Chinese and other foreign journalists. The US is disappointed that a New York Times reporter was forced to leave China due to delays in processing his press credentials. Several other US journalists have also been waiting for extended periods of time for a decision on their press credentials and visa applications. The US has raised these concerns with the Chinese government at the highest levels and will continue to do so. The US believes that media exchanges between the two countries should be expanded to enhance mutual understanding and trust, rather than restricting the work of journalists. The US urges China to commit to timely visa and credentialing decisions for foreign journalists, unblock US media websites, and eliminate other restrictions that hinder journalists' ability to practice their profession. The US strongly supports universal rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of speech and freedom of the press.
