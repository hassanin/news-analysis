The Biden-Harris Administration has announced that COVID-19 vaccine requirements for federal employees, federal contractors, and international air travelers will end on May 11, the same day the COVID-19 public health emergency ends. The requirements for Head Start educators, CMS-certified healthcare facilities, and certain noncitizens at the land border will also be phased out. These requirements were put in place to promote health and safety, protect the economy, and vulnerable populations. Since January 2021, COVID-19 deaths have declined by 95% and hospitalizations are down nearly 91%. The vaccination requirements have helped ensure the safety of workers in critical sectors and have boosted vaccination rates across the nation. However, as the country enters a different phase of the response to COVID-19, these measures are no longer deemed necessary.
