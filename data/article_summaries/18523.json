Executive Order 13549, issued by President Barack Obama on August 18, 2010, establishes a Classified National Security Information Program (Program) to safeguard and regulate access to classified national security information shared by the Federal Government with State, local, tribal, and private sector entities (SLTPS). The purpose of this order is to ensure that security standards governing access to and safeguarding of classified material are applied in accordance with existing executive orders and procedures. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with other relevant agencies, is tasked with issuing an implementing directive within 180 days of the order to establish procedures for uniform implementation of these standards by SLTPS entities. The order also outlines additional policy provisions for access to and safeguarding of classified information by SLTPS personnel. The Secretary of Homeland Security serves as the Executive Agent for the Program, with policy guidance from the National Security Advisor. A Policy Advisory Committee is established to discuss and resolve policy issues related to the Program. The Executive Agent is responsible for program management, oversight, accreditation, monitoring, and training for SLT entities and facilities that have access to classified information. Private sector facilities are managed by the Secretary of Defense or the cognizant security agency. The Director of National Intelligence may inspect and monitor SLTPS programs and facilities involving intelligence information. The order also includes definitions, general provisions, and an effective date of 180 days from the order.
