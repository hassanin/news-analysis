The Biden-Harris Administration has released a National Response Plan to combat the dangerous combination of xylazine mixed with fentanyl. Earlier this year, the administration used executive designation authority to declare this combination as an emerging threat to the United States. The plan focuses on six pillars of action, including testing, data collection, prevention, harm reduction, treatment, supply reduction, scheduling, and research. The goal of the plan is to terminate the threat of fentanyl combined with xylazine by reducing xylazine-related drug poisoning deaths by 15% in at least three of the four U.S. census regions by 2025. The plan outlines action steps for federal departments and agencies and requires them to submit an Implementation Report to the White House. The administration has already taken several actions to address this threat, including restricting the entry of xylazine into the country and issuing public safety alerts. The plan emphasizes the need for a whole-of-society effort to save lives and includes steps that states and individuals can take to address the issue.
