On May 23, 2011, President Barack Obama issued an Executive Order implementing further sanctions on Iran. This order was in response to the actions and policies of the Iranian government, which were deemed to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The order was issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and implemented the statutory requirements of the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996, as amended by the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010. These sanctions were aimed at addressing Iran's illicit nuclear activities, development of unconventional weapons and ballistic missiles, support for international terrorism, and potential connection between its nuclear program and energy sector. The order delegated authority to the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to take various actions, such as prohibiting loans or credits from US financial institutions, restricting foreign exchange transactions, blocking property and interests in property, and restricting imports from certain individuals or entities. All executive agencies were directed to take appropriate measures to enforce the provisions of the order.
