This article is about an executive order issued by President Barack Obama in 2014 to establish a minimum wage for federal contractors. The order states that the hourly minimum wage paid by these contractors should be at least $10.10, starting from January 1, 2015. The Secretary of Labor is responsible for determining the minimum wage amount for subsequent years. The order also includes provisions for tipped workers and requires agencies to take steps to ensure compliance with the minimum wage requirements. The Secretary of Labor is tasked with enforcing the order, and any disputes regarding wage payments will be handled according to regulations issued by the Secretary. The order does not create any rights or benefits enforceable against the United States or its agencies. It applies to new contracts or contract-like instruments related to services, construction, concessions, or services offered to federal employees or the general public. The order does not apply to grants or contracts with Indian Tribes, and independent agencies are encouraged to comply. The effective date of the order is January 1, 2015, for contracts issued after that date. Agencies are encouraged to ensure that individuals working on contracts negotiated between the date of the order and the effective dates are paid at least $10.10 per hour.
