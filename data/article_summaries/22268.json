This article is a press gaggle by Press Secretary Jay Carney, en route to Columbus, Ohio. Carney discusses the President's all-of-the-above strategy for American-made energy and the importance of the Senate's bipartisan vote on a bill that helps small businesses and start-ups access capital. Carney also addresses questions about the World Bank candidate, the Keystone pipeline, the President's visit to the Cushing site, troop presence in Afghanistan, and the NFL's decision on the New Orleans Saints. He concludes by mentioning the anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act and a video released by the White House to inform Americans about the benefits of the law.
