The article discusses the case of Maria Fuertes, a 92-year-old woman who was raped and murdered in Queens, New York. The suspect, Reeaz Khan, is an illegal immigrant from Guyana who had previously been arrested for assault. Despite a detainer request from U.S. immigration officials, Khan was released from jail by New York City due to its "sanctuary" policies. These policies aim to prevent the deportation of illegal immigrants with criminal charges and convictions. Daria Ortiz, the granddaughter of the victim, joined President Trump at a White House event to honor Border Patrol heroes and called for legislation that would allow American victims to sue sanctuary cities. President Trump expressed his support for this proposal and emphasized the need to prevent further tragedies caused by sanctuary city policies.
