The White House has launched the "Stop the Bleed" campaign, which aims to provide bystanders with the tools and knowledge to stop life-threatening bleeding in emergency situations. The campaign will work with the private sector and nonprofit organizations to make the knowledge gained by first responders and the military accessible to the general public. Uncontrolled bleeding can result from natural disasters, accidents, and man-made disasters, and can potentially kill within minutes. Research has shown that bystanders, even without medical training, can save lives by taking simple steps to stop severe bleeding. The campaign aims to improve public awareness and access to Bleeding Control Kits, similar to the use of CPR or automatic defibrillators. The goal is to empower the public to be prepared and promote access to Bleeding Control Kits in public spaces, while traveling, and at home. The event included representatives from private sector groups and nonprofit organizations working to implement and accelerate the initiative.
