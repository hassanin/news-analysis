The United States is working closely with Canada to end the blockade of key bridges and crossings between the two countries and restore vital commerce. President Biden had a video teleconference with Prime Minister Trudeau, and subsequent conversations have taken place to express appreciation for law enforcement efforts to resolve the blockades. The Secretary of Homeland Security and Secretary of Transportation have also spoken with their Canadian counterparts, and updates indicate that most protestors have been cleared from the Ambassador bridge and barriers are being removed. Canadian authorities are taking proactive steps to prevent further disruption, including citing individuals for trespassing and towing their vehicles. The Ambassador Bridge is expected to reopen today after safety checks. The White House is also in contact with Governor Whitmer and other officials to address the situation.
