Vice President Kamala Harris held a discussion with business leaders to discuss collaboration and maximizing opportunities in the Northern Triangle and Mexico. The Vice President emphasized two guiding principles for their work: most people don't want to leave their homes unless they are fleeing harm or unable to meet basic needs, and the belief that they can give people hope that help is on the way. The administration is focused on collaboration and partnership, including public-private partnerships, engaging nonprofits and foundations, working with allies in the U.N., and involving civil society. The Vice President acknowledged that the issues they are addressing are longstanding and include factors such as violence, corruption, food insecurity, and extreme weather conditions. The call to action for businesses to invest in the Northern Triangle was launched, with a focus on digital inclusion and workforce development. Several companies, including MasterCard, Microsoft, and Nespresso, have already made commitments to support economic development in the region. The Vice President emphasized the importance of turning commitments into tangible actions that give people a sense of what is possible for themselves and their families.
