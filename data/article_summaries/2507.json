In this proclamation, President Biden declares the termination of the national emergency declared at the southern border in 2019 and directs a pause in the construction of the border wall. He states that building a massive wall is not a serious policy solution and diverts attention from genuine threats to homeland security. The President emphasizes the commitment to a comprehensive and humane immigration system that aligns with the nation's values. The Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security are instructed to assess the legality and consequences of the wall construction projects, pause the work and obligation of funds, and compile detailed information on the contracts and funds used. A plan for redirecting funding and repurposing contracts will be developed within 60 days. The proclamation clarifies the definition of a "wall" and states that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities.
