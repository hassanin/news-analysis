The White House Office of the Press Secretary held a press briefing on September 22, 2014. During the briefing, Press Secretary Josh Earnest addressed questions regarding the recent security breach at the White House, the President's reaction to the incident, and the ongoing efforts to build a coalition to combat ISIS. Earnest also discussed the United States' response to Iran's offer to work with the US and its allies to stop ISIS, and clarified that the P5-plus-1 talks are separate from the conversations on combating ISIS. The briefing also covered topics such as the cost of the war against ISIS, the President's involvement in the United Nations activities, and the administration's response to the recent climate change demonstrations. Additionally, Earnest answered questions about the administration's position on private efforts to expose secret funding sources for ISIS, and the President's stance on the tax status of the National Football League. Earnest also touched on the President's focus on the upcoming midterm elections and his belief that there is a clear difference between the parties on policies related to the middle class.
