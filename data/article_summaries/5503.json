The White House released a report highlighting how the Biden-Harris Administration is supporting small businesses in the manufacturing industry through the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). The report showcases the administration's Investing in America agenda and its impact on small manufacturers. It mentions that since the start of the administration, small businesses have created 3.1 million jobs and have seen a record number of applications for new businesses. The SSBCI, authorized by the American Rescue Plan, provides small businesses with access to capital for investing in manufacturing equipment and assets. Over $8 billion in SSBCI capital has been approved for 52 states and territories, expected to generate private investments of up to $10 for every $1 of SSBCI funding. The report also mentions the administration's efforts to address common challenges faced by small manufacturers, such as reducing lender risk and expanding access to working capital. Vice President Kamala Harris will visit Babylon Micro-Farms, a small manufacturing company in Virginia, that received an equity investment from the Virginia SSBCI program. The report emphasizes that small businesses are crucial to the manufacturing sector, employing close to 9% of the U.S. workforce and generating half of all industrial output. It also criticizes House Republicans for passing a bill that would cut funding for small business programs and target the SSBCI.
