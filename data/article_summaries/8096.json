President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed May 2023 as Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. The proclamation recognizes the diversity, achievements, and contributions of these communities to the United States. It highlights notable individuals, such as Vice President Kamala Harris and Ambassador Katherine Tai, who represent AA and NHPIs in government positions. The President acknowledges the persistent racism, harassment, and hate crimes targeting these communities, emphasizing the need for dignity and respect for all individuals. To address the rise in anti-Asian violence, the President signed the bipartisan COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law. The administration has launched the National Strategy to Advance Equity, Justice, and Opportunity for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Communities, aiming to improve their lives through accurate data collection, safety, inclusion, language access, and representation in the federal workforce. Economic opportunities for AA and NHPI workers and business owners are being created, and efforts to advance equity and opportunity are ongoing. The President has signed legislation to establish the National Museum of Asian Pacific American History and Culture, expand protections for the Pacific Remote Islands, and establish a memorial for Japanese Americans unjustly incarcerated during World War II. The proclamation reaffirms the country's commitment to equality and calls upon all Americans to learn about AA and NHPI history and observe the month with appropriate programs and activities.
