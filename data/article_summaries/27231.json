President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation declaring April 2018 as National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. The proclamation emphasizes the need to stop crimes of sexual violence, provide care for victims, enforce the law, prosecute offenders, and raise awareness about sexual assault. It acknowledges that sexual assault crimes are tragically common and that offenders often evade accountability. The proclamation calls for identifying and holding perpetrators accountable, as well as empowering victims to speak out and seek help. It also highlights the importance of tailoring responses to the unique needs of each victim and announces the creation of a new resource, the Sexual Assault Victim Intervention Services Technical Assistance Center (SAVIS TAC), to help community officials and organizations respond appropriately to sexual assault. The proclamation encourages open dialogue about sexual assault, urges victims to report the crimes, and calls on law enforcement, healthcare providers, and various organizations to support survivors and work together to prevent sexual assault in their communities.
