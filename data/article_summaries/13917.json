President Obama will be hosting the 2016 White House Tribal Nations Conference on September 26 in Washington, DC. This will be his eighth and final conference of this kind, where tribal leaders from the 567 federally recognized tribes will have the opportunity to interact with federal government officials and members of the White House Council on Native American Affairs. Each tribe is invited to send one representative to the conference. The conference aims to strengthen the government-to-government relationship with Indian Country and improve the lives of American Indians and Alaska Natives. More details about the conference will be released at a later date.
