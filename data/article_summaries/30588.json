Second Lady Karen Pence visited the Indiana State Fair to view artwork by members of the Indiana World Organization of China Painters. These artists are competing for the opportunity to hand paint designs on porcelain china plates for the Vice President's Residence in Washington, DC. The artists submitted examples of their work, and fair attendees can vote for their favorite pieces. The winning artists will paint designs on 100 salad and dessert plates. The project aims to showcase the talent of Indiana artists and contribute to the history of china painting. The World Organization of China Painters estimates that 30-40 artists will participate in the project, with completion expected before the Christmas holiday season. This is not the first time the Indiana World Organization of China Painters has participated in such a project, as they previously painted bowls for the First Lady's Charitable Foundation Luncheon in 2014. The organization aims to promote and study the art of china painting.
