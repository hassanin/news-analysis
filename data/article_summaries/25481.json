During National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, the US government reaffirms its commitment to fighting prostate cancer and making it a world free from cancer. The rate of new cases and deaths due to prostate cancer has been decreasing over the past decade, thanks to innovative research and improvements in treatment. However, prostate cancer still remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men. The government is dedicated to finding better diagnostic and treatment options through the 21st Century Cures Act and research collaborations. The National Institutes of Health is also investing in research to combat prostate cancer. The government encourages men to talk to their healthcare providers about their risk for prostate cancer and calls upon all Americans to raise awareness about the disease.
