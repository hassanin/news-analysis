The Department of Labor has finalized a rule that updates overtime protections for workers. The rule is expected to extend overtime protections to 4.2 million more Americans and boost wages for workers by $12 billion over the next 10 years. Currently, only 7% of full-time workers qualify for overtime based on their salaries, compared to 62% in 1975. The new rule doubles the salary threshold under which most salaried workers are guaranteed overtime, from $23,660 to $47,476 per year. This threshold will be automatically updated every three years. The rule also raises the "highly compensated employee" threshold from $100,000 to $134,004. Employers will be able to count bonuses and commissions toward as much as 10% of the salary threshold. The rule takes effect on December 1, 2016.
