The August jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that America added nearly 1.4 million new jobs, in line with expectations. The unemployment rate also fell by 1.8 percentage points to 8.4 percent, the second largest decline on record. This report confirms that the strong recovery in the labor market continues. Despite the devastating impact of COVID-19, the unemployment rate has fallen by 6.3 percentage points in just four months, compared to nearly a decade after the Great Recession. The Trump administration claims that America is on track to witness the fastest labor market recovery from any economic crisis in history. The report also highlights the progress made since April, with the number of temporary layoffs decreasing and employment increasing for Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, women, and those without a high school diploma. Overall, the report suggests that the economic comeback is underway and going strong.
