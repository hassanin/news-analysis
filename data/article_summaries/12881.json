This article is a presidential determination by Barack Obama regarding the supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran. The determination states that there is a sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran, allowing for a significant reduction in the volume of petroleum and petroleum products purchased from Iran. However, the United States will continue to fulfill its commitments specified in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and will no longer pursue efforts to reduce Iran's sales of crude oil. The determination became effective upon reaching Implementation Day under the JCPOA, which occurred once the International Atomic Energy Agency verified that Iran had implemented key nuclear-related steps specified in the JCPOA. The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
