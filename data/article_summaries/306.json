President Joe Biden has declared a major disaster in Tennessee due to severe storms and tornadoes that occurred on December 9, 2023. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in affected areas. Assistance includes grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to support individuals and business owners in recovering from the disaster. Federal funding is also available to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency protective measures and hazard mitigation measures. Yolanda J. Jackson of FEMA has been appointed to coordinate federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing, and additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated once assessments are complete. Residents and business owners in the designated areas can apply for assistance through DisasterAssistance.gov, by calling 800-621-FEMA, or using the FEMA App. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
