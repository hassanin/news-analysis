The article discusses the United States-Indonesia Comprehensive Partnership, a commitment made by Presidents Obama and Yudhoyono to strengthen bilateral relations between the two countries. The partnership was officially launched in November 2010 and is based on three pillars: political and security, economic and development, and socio-cultural, education, science, and technology cooperation. Six working groups have been established to coordinate strategies and priorities under the partnership. The U.S. Secretary of State and the Indonesian Foreign Minister co-chair a Joint Commission to ensure the partnership's momentum. Senior-level dialogues have also been established on various topics such as commercial ties, energy policy, health, and trade and investment.
