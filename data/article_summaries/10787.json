In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims the week of October 11 through October 17, 2009, as National School Lunch Week. He emphasizes the importance of providing young Americans with wholesome, nutritious lunches to prevent hunger and promote their growth and development. The National School Lunch Program, in place since 1946, serves over 31 million students every school day, offering balanced, low-cost or free meals that often contain essential nutrients. The program not only helps prevent hunger but also teaches children about good eating habits and fights against childhood obesity. The President calls for collaboration between the government, schools, and local leaders to strengthen the program, remove barriers that prevent eligible children from receiving meals, and update nutrition standards based on the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Obama recognizes and honors all those involved in making the National School Lunch Program possible, including government and school officials, food service professionals, farmers, and parents. He urges Americans to participate in activities that support the health and well-being of the nation's children.
