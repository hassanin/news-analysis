President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed April 2018 as Second Chance Month in the United States. The proclamation emphasizes the need to prevent crime, respect the rule of law, and provide opportunities for individuals with criminal records to earn a second chance. The goal is to reduce crime rates and prison populations, decrease burdens on taxpayers, and make America safer. The proclamation highlights the importance of successful re-entry into society for those with criminal records, particularly through employment. The President is committed to advancing reform efforts to prevent crime, improve re-entry, and reduce recidivism. He calls on federal, state, and local prison systems to implement evidence-based programs that provide prisoners with the necessary skills and preparation to succeed in society. The proclamation encourages Americans to commemorate Second Chance Month with events and activities that raise public awareness about preventing crime and providing second chances to those who have completed their sentences.
