In this message to Congress, President Barack Obama announces his intention to end the suspension of preferential treatment for Burma (also known as Myanmar) as a beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. He plans to designate Burma as a least-developed beneficiary developing country for the purposes of the GSP program. The President explains that he has carefully considered the criteria set forth in the Trade Act of 1974 and has determined that it is appropriate to add Burma to the list of GSP beneficiary developing countries and least-developed beneficiary developing countries in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. This notice is submitted in accordance with the Trade Act of 1974.
