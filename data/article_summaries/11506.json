ConnectHome is a new initiative launched by the White House to extend high-speed broadband access to low-income families across the United States. The program will initially reach nearly 275,000 low-income households and almost 200,000 children in 27 cities. ConnectHome is an extension of the ConnectED initiative, which aims to connect 99% of K-12 students to high-speed internet in schools and libraries within the next five years. The Obama administration is partnering with internet service providers, non-profit organizations, and the private sector to provide broadband access, technical training, and computer education programs to residents in assisted housing units. Despite the progress made in expanding broadband access, a new analysis by the President's Council of Economic Advisers reveals that some Americans, especially low-income children, still lack access to high-speed internet. ConnectHome aims to bridge this digital divide and provide more opportunities for computer literacy in the United States.
