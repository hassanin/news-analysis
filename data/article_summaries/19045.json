The President of the United States has announced a change in policy regarding condolence letters to the families of service members who commit suicide while deployed to a combat zone. Previously, these letters were not sent, but now the President has decided to reverse that policy. This decision was made after careful consideration and consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the military chain of command. The President recognizes the emotional, painful, and complicated nature of this issue, but believes that these service members deserve to be honored and that the fact they did not receive the help they needed must change. The President also emphasizes the need to support and care for all men and women in uniform, as they have borne the burden of the nation's wars.
