Vice President Joe Biden will host a panel of leading scholars to discuss the challenges facing America's middle class in the 21st century economy. The discussion, co-hosted by the Center for American Progress and the Economic Policy Institute, will focus on various economic developments and trends affecting middle-class families, including changes to the labor market, shifting gender roles, economic inequality, and the gap between productivity and wages. The event is open to print, radio, and still photographers and will be pooled for TV coverage. The White House Task Force on Middle Class Families was established in January 2009 to address the economic difficulties experienced by middle-class households and to lift the living standards of middle-class families.
