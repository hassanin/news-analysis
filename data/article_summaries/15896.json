In this letter, President Barack Obama informs the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate that he has issued an Executive Order revoking previous Executive Orders related to Iran. The purpose of this revocation is to give effect to the United States' commitments with respect to sanctions described in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) between the P5+1, the EU, and Iran. The President explains that the JCPOA will prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and ensure that its nuclear program remains peaceful. The President also states that he has determined Iran's implementation of the nuclear-related measures specified in the JCPOA marks a fundamental shift in circumstances, justifying the revocation of the previous Executive Orders. The letter further explains that the Executive Order provides implementation authorities for certain statutory sanctions that are outside the scope of the U.S. commitments under the JCPOA. The President delegates the authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to take necessary actions to carry out the purposes of the order, and directs all agencies of the United States Government to take appropriate measures to implement the provisions of the order.
