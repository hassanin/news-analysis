On June 26, 2001, President Obama declared a national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans due to the threat posed by extremist violence in Macedonia and other parts of the region, as well as acts obstructing the Dayton Accords in Bosnia and UN Security Council Resolution 1244 in Kosovo. This declaration was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The President amended this order in 2003. The President has now announced that the national emergency will continue for another year beyond June 26, 2011, due to the ongoing threat to US national security and foreign policy. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
