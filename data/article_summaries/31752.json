The annual estimate by the United States Government shows that poppy cultivation in Mexico reached a record high in 2017. Poppy cultivation increased by 38 percent, from 32,000 hectares in 2016 to 44,100 hectares in 2017. Similarly, the potential pure production of heroin rose by 37 percent, from 81 metric tons in 2016 to 111 metric tons in 2017. This increase in Mexican poppy cultivation and heroin production poses a greater threat to the United States. Provisional data suggests that over 49,000 Americans, or 134 per day, died from opioid-related overdoses in 2017, with nearly 16,000 of these deaths involving heroin. President Trump is committed to addressing drug demand and the opioid crisis by implementing effective drug abuse prevention, evidence-based addiction treatment, and law enforcement actions. The United States Government will work with the Government of Mexico to enhance their partnership and tackle this problem together.
