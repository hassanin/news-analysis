President Biden embarked on his first trip to the West Coast as President of the United States. He traveled to Boise, Idaho, to receive a briefing from federal and state fire agency officials at the National Interagency Fire Center. He then traveled to Northern California to speak with emergency response personnel at the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services and surveyed damage from the Caldor fire, one of the many wildfires that have devastated California this year. The President reiterated the message he shared on the East Coast last week, emphasizing that the climate crisis is in code red. He highlighted that the investments he is proposing in the bipartisan infrastructure deal and the Build Back Better agenda will strengthen the nation's resilience to climate change and extreme weather events, promote environmental justice, and create good-paying jobs. The President will also be traveling to Denver, Colorado, to continue discussions on tackling the climate crisis and modernizing infrastructure. In addition to his trip, President Biden addressed various topics during a press briefing, including the North Korean missile launch, Senator Joe Manchin's opposition to the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill, the declassification of documents related to the 9/11 attacks, tax reform proposals, voting rights legislation, Supreme Court reform, and the ongoing situation in Afghanistan.
