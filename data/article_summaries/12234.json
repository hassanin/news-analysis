President Obama has granted commutation of sentence to 79 individuals convicted of drug offenses. These individuals were serving long prison sentences for offenses related to the possession, distribution, and conspiracy to distribute drugs such as cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and marijuana. The commutations vary in terms of the length of sentence reduction and the conditions imposed, such as enrollment in residential drug treatment. The commutations aim to address the issue of excessive sentences for non-violent drug offenses and promote criminal justice reform.
