Seventy-nine years ago, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which resulted in the wrongful internment of around 120,000 Americans of Japanese descent. This action stripped Japanese Americans of their civil rights and forced them to live in inhumane concentration camps across the United States. The Federal government's decision to target and imprison Japanese Americans based on their heritage was deemed immoral and unconstitutional. However, the Supreme Court upheld this policy, leading to one of the most significant miscarriages of justice in the Court's history. Today, we acknowledge and apologize for the suffering caused by these policies. The internment of Japanese Americans highlights the tragic consequences of systemic racism, xenophobia, and nativism. We honor the bravery of individuals like Fred Korematsu, who fought against Japanese internment and became symbols of hope. Their legacies remind us of the importance of defending and protecting civil liberties.
