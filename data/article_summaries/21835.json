The article is a Presidential Memorandum by Barack Obama, which states that the United States will continue providing drug interdiction assistance to the government of Colombia. The memorandum is based on the authority vested in the President by the National Defense Authorization Act. The President certifies that interdiction of aircraft engaged in illicit drug trafficking in Colombia's airspace is necessary due to the significant threat it poses to the country's national security. Additionally, Colombia has established procedures to prevent innocent loss of life during interdiction, including methods to identify and warn aircraft before the use of force is employed. The Secretary of State is instructed to publish this determination in the Federal Register and inform Congress about it.
