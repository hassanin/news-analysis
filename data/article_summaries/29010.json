The United States has condemned the use of force by the Venezuelan military against unarmed civilians and volunteers on the country's border with Brazil. Reports suggest that two indigenous people have been killed and many others injured as they try to keep the border open for humanitarian aid. Venezuelan Interim President Juan Guaido has requested immediate assistance from the international community, while the Maduro regime has ordered the closure of the borders and repression of aid efforts. The United States strongly urges the Venezuelan military to protect its citizens and allow humanitarian aid to enter peacefully.
