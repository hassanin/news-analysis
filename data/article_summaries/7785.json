The article discusses a memorandum addressed to the Secretary of Energy, stating that a drawdown and sale of petroleum from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) is required due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused energy supply shortages and a significant increase in oil prices worldwide. This poses a threat to the United States' economic growth during its recovery phase. The drawdown and sale of petroleum from the SPR will help the United States fulfill its obligations under the International Energy Program implemented by the International Energy Agency. The Secretary is authorized and directed to sell the petroleum to the highest qualified bidder at a rate determined by the Secretary, following the SPR competitive sales procedures. The Secretary also has the authority to cancel any offer to sell petroleum if the circumstances leading to this finding change. The memorandum is signed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
