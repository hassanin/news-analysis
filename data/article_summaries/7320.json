President Biden addressed three main topics during his speech: the new tax cut for families with children, the progress in the fight against COVID-19, and the US's efforts to provide vaccines to other countries. 

Regarding the tax cut, President Biden highlighted that families with children will receive a tax cut of $3,000 per child under the age of 18, or $3,600 per child under the age of six. He announced that starting July 15th, families will receive half of their tax cut, at least $250 per child, deposited into their bank accounts every month.

President Biden then discussed the progress in the fight against COVID-19, stating that for the first time since the pandemic began, COVID-19 cases are down in all 50 states. He emphasized the importance of getting vaccinated and urged the unvaccinated to do so, as it not only protects themselves but also those around them. He encouraged everyone to work together to reach the target of vaccinating 70% of adults with at least one shot by July 4th.

Lastly, President Biden announced that the US will share 80 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines with other countries. This includes 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is not yet authorized for use in the US, and doses of Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines as they become available. He emphasized the need for global cooperation in ending the pandemic and stated that the US will lead the effort.

In response to a question about the escalating violence in a specific region, President Biden mentioned that he will be speaking with the Prime Minister and will address the issue afterward.
