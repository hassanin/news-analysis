The Department of Justice has filed a legal challenge to the Don't Ask, Don't Tell (DADT) policy, which restricts openly gay individuals from serving in the military. This filing does not change President Obama's commitment to repealing DADT through legislation. The President expressed disappointment when the Senate failed to proceed with the National Defense Authorization Act, which included a repeal of DADT, due to political posturing. The President, along with his Administration, will continue to work with Senate leadership to achieve a legislative repeal of DADT. The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs have both testified in support of repealing DADT, and the Department of Defense is working on a plan to implement the repeal.
