The Trump Administration's regulatory reform efforts have saved American families and businesses $23 billion in Fiscal Year 2018 by eliminating burdensome and unnecessary regulations. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) reported that Federal Agencies issued 176 deregulatory actions. This demonstrates President Trump's commitment to promoting economic freedom and reducing regulations that hinder job creators. The administration aims to prioritize the rule of law and ensure that agencies regulate only when necessary, focusing on individual freedom and the potential of American workers, innovators, and businesses.
