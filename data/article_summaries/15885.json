This article is a letter from President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Sudan. The letter explains that the crisis caused by the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan, which led to the declaration of a national emergency in 1997, has not been resolved. These actions and policies are considered hostile to US interests and pose a continuing threat to national security and foreign policy. Therefore, President Obama has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and maintain sanctions against Sudan in response to this threat.
