The President has issued an Executive Order authorizing additional sanctions on North Korea in response to their provocative and destabilizing actions, specifically their cyber attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment. The Executive Order allows the Secretary of the Treasury to impose sanctions on individuals and entities associated with the North Korean government. The U.S. takes the attack seriously as it aimed to create financial damage to a U.S. company and restrict the right to free expression. These sanctions are the first step in the U.S. response, which will be proportional and carried out at a time and manner of their choosing.
