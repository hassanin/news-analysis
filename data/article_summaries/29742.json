President Trump welcomed three companies, Merck, Pfizer, and Corning, to the White House to announce that pharmaceutical glass packaging will now be made in America. This partnership between the companies will create thousands of American manufacturing jobs and involve an initial investment of at least $500 million. The companies expect a total investment of at least $4 billion and the creation of 4,000 American jobs in the long run. This move is seen as a breakthrough in pharmaceutical glass technology, which will improve the safety of medicines and vaccines for patients and healthcare workers. The President also mentioned that regulations will be streamlined to facilitate advancements in the healthcare industry.
