The Obama Administration has announced plans to make it easier for students to manage their student loan debt. One proposal is the "Pay As You Earn" plan, which will allow borrowers to reduce their monthly payments to 10 percent of their discretionary income starting in 2014. Another proposal will allow about 1.6 million students to cap their loan payments at 10 percent starting next year, with the plan forgiving the remaining debt after 20 years of payments. Additionally, starting in January, an estimated 6 million students and recent graduates will be able to consolidate their loans and reduce their interest rates. The goal is to increase college affordability and help students save money. The changes will not cost taxpayers any additional money. The administration is also introducing a Financial Aid Shopping Sheet to help students better understand their financial aid options and compare aid packages from different institutions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is seeking feedback on this form. The Small Business Administration has launched a website to help young entrepreneurs reduce their student loan payments, and the Young Entrepreneur Council's Gen Y Fund has committed to investing in startups and paying down the federal student loan obligations of these entrepreneurs.
