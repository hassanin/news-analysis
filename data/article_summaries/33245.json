Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, recently embarked on the third "Back to Our Roots" RV tour, visiting Michigan, Ohio, and Kentucky to hear directly from the American people. While Congress works on the Farm Bill and other agriculture priorities, the Trump administration remains committed to representing farmers, ranchers, producers, and foresters. Perdue has traveled to 35 states in the past 11 months, fulfilling President Trump's promise to give a voice to those who felt forgotten. During the tour, common issues raised by the American people include trade and the economy, the workforce, and burdensome regulations. The administration is working to address these concerns. Trump has led the fight for tax cuts and reforms, which are already benefiting the agriculture community. The administration is also focused on expanding trade opportunities for American harvest globally. A capable and legal workforce is essential for the economy to thrive, and the president is committed to providing resources and support to rural America. The Interagency Task Force on Agriculture and Rural Prosperity, chaired by Perdue, has offered recommendations in this regard. Infrastructure reform is also a priority, as it would create jobs and unleash the economy's full potential. Engaging the next generation is crucial, and Perdue has met with young agriculture leaders to encourage them to face the challenges ahead. Lastly, the administration is working to repeal burdensome regulations that hinder productivity. Trump has eliminated unnecessary barriers and is focused on meeting the needs of rural Americans. The administration is actively working to fulfill its promises and the USDA's motto of "Do Right and Feed Everyone."
