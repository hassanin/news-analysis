President Trump held a meeting with Republican and Democratic lawmakers to discuss immigration reform and specifically the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The president expressed his desire to see a bipartisan bill that addresses three main goals: securing the border, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery program. He also emphasized the need for a wall along the southern border and stronger enforcement measures. The lawmakers discussed the possibility of a clean DACA bill followed by comprehensive immigration reform. They also touched on issues such as border security, visa overstays, and the role of the wall in preventing illegal immigration. The president expressed his willingness to sign a bill that is agreed upon by both parties. The meeting concluded with a general consensus that progress could be made on finding a solution for DACA recipients while also addressing border security concerns.
