A district court has made a decision that goes against the immigration policies of the United States, disregarding the voices and opinions of American citizens. President Trump recognized that different communities have different resources to support refugees, and therefore should have a say in whether or not they are placed in their communities. The Trump Administration fulfilled this promise by giving states and localities a role in deciding on refugee placement. The court's ruling is seen as unreasonable and another example of nationwide district court injunctions, and the government is reviewing options to protect communities and the refugee resettlement process.
