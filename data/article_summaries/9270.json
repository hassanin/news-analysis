The Biden-Harris Administration has taken decisive action to support the safe reopening of schools for in-person instruction and to address the pandemic's impact on underserved students. They have prioritized safe reopening by launching a comprehensive effort across various departments, providing resources on safely reopening schools, and promoting vaccination for teachers and school staff. The administration has also invested $130 billion through the American Rescue Plan to support schools in reopening safely and addressing the needs of students. This funding is being used to implement measures such as high-quality summer learning programs, hiring nurses and counselors, and supporting vaccination efforts. The administration is ensuring that funds address the needs of students by requiring a minimum percentage of funding to be spent on addressing the impact of lost instructional time and responding to students' social and emotional needs. They are also protecting high-poverty districts from funding cuts and ensuring that states continue to fund education. The Department of Education is working to support states and school districts in implementing education relief funding and addressing the needs of students experiencing homelessness, students with disabilities, and tribal education. The administration is also funding COVID-19 testing in schools, protecting the rights of students, closing the digital divide, and supporting nutrition security for students. Overall, the administration is committed to building back better and ensuring that schools and students recover from the pandemic.
