The article discusses the continuation of a national emergency declared by the President of the United States in response to the actions and policies of the Russian Federation that threaten the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The national emergency was first declared in 2014 and has been expanded through several executive orders. The latest executive order, issued in February 2022, further expanded the scope of the national emergency due to Russia's recognition of the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic regions of Ukraine, which contradicts its commitments under the Minsk agreements and poses a threat to the peace, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine. The President has decided to continue the national emergency for another year, as these actions and policies still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States.
