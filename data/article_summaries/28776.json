The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has released the Trump Administration's National Drug Control Strategy. The strategy focuses on reducing the number of Americans dying from drug overdoses and emphasizes prevention, treatment, and curbing the flow of drugs into communities. The ONDCP Director, Jim Carroll, stated that the administration has made progress in these areas but needs to continue building momentum and strengthening communities. Along with the strategy, the ONDCP has also released the Performance Reporting System, the Data Supplement, and the first National Treatment Plan for Substance Use Disorder.
