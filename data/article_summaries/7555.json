The Culmination of Talent Pipeline Challenge is an initiative launched by the Biden-Harris Administration to address workforce development in the infrastructure sector. Over 350 organizations in 50 states and territories have made commitments to support equitable workforce development in the broadband, construction, and electrification sectors. These commitments aim to train workers for the millions of good-paying union jobs created by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and other related acts. The Challenge includes commitments from employers, unions, education and training providers, states, local governments, Tribes, territories, philanthropic organizations, and other stakeholders. The commitments will expand pathways to good jobs, boost opportunities for union jobs, and meet employer skill needs. The event recognizing these commitments includes demonstrations by tradespeople from participating unions to showcase critical skills needed for infrastructure implementation. Various organizations and sectors have made commitments to expand training programs, provide supportive services, increase recruitment of underrepresented workers, invest resources, and provide funding. These commitments complement federal investments and administrative actions in workforce development.
