UAW President Bob King has expressed support for President Obama's American Jobs Act. He believes that immediate action is needed to pass the bill in order to create jobs for various sectors, such as construction workers, teachers, veterans, first responders, young people, and the long-term unemployed. King urges Congress to prioritize job creation over partisan politics and tax cuts for the wealthy. He emphasizes the importance of repairing America's infrastructure to both help unemployed families and reduce the nation's deficit. UAW is calling on workers to join them in supporting the American Jobs Act by adding their names to an online petition. They plan to deliver the petition to Congress and demand a sustainable job creation program.
