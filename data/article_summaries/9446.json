President Barack Obama has proclaimed May 24 through May 30, 2015 as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. In his proclamation, he emphasizes the need to protect ourselves, loved ones, and communities from the devastating effects of hurricanes and tropical storms. The President highlights the importance of strengthening the capacity of local responders and creating resilient cities, towns, and neighborhoods. The administration is partnering with state, local, and tribal governments to develop emergency plans, evacuation routes, and disaster alerts. They are also funding rebuilding efforts in hurricane-devastated areas and implementing a Unified Federal Review process to aid in recovery assistance. Additionally, President Obama acknowledges the projected increase in hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates due to rising sea surface temperatures and sea levels. As part of the Climate Action Plan, the administration is taking steps to prepare for and combat these effects. The President encourages all Americans living in hurricane-threatened areas to take simple steps to prepare their families for severe weather, such as identifying evacuation zones, building emergency supply kits, and practicing family communication strategies. He also calls upon government agencies, private organizations, schools, media, and residents in coastal areas to share information about hurricane preparedness and response to save lives and protect communities.
