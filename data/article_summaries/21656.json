The President has commended the Senate for passing the Claims Settlement Act of 2010, which provides funding for the Pigford II lawsuit brought by African American farmers and the Cobell lawsuit brought by Native Americans. He thanks Attorney General Holder and Secretaries Salazar and Vilsack for their efforts and urges the House to pass the legislation as well. The bill also includes settlements for water rights suits by Native American tribes, and the President supports these settlements. He mentions that there is still work to be done, particularly in resolving claims of past discrimination by women and Hispanic farmers against the USDA.
