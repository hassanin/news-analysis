President Joe Biden has signed an Executive Order aimed at protecting critical technologies that are vital to national security. The order authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to regulate certain U.S. investments in countries of concern, particularly in the areas of semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum information technologies, and artificial intelligence. The People's Republic of China (PRC) has been identified as a country of concern. The Department of the Treasury has also released a proposed rulemaking to define the scope of the program. The goal is to prevent foreign countries from exploiting U.S. investments in technologies that could pose risks to national security. The program will complement existing export control and screening tools and will prohibit certain investments in entities engaged in specific activities related to these technologies. It will also require notification for other sensitive investments. The Executive Order is the result of extensive consultations with stakeholders, industry members, and foreign allies. The public will have the opportunity to provide feedback before the rule goes into effect.
