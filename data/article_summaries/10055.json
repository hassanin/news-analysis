The leaders of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, the President of the European Council, and the President of the European Commission expressed their concern over the efforts by separatists backed by Russia to destabilize eastern Ukraine. They are committed to taking further steps to ensure a peaceful and stable environment for the upcoming presidential election in Ukraine on May 25. They welcomed the positive steps taken by Ukraine to meet its commitments under the Geneva accord, including working towards constitutional reform and decentralization, proposing an amnesty law for those who peacefully leave the occupied buildings in eastern Ukraine, and supporting the work of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). They noted that the Government of Ukraine has acted with restraint in dealing with the armed bands illegally occupying government buildings. In contrast, Russia has not taken any concrete actions to support the Geneva accord. They strongly condemn Russia's illegal attempt to annex Crimea and Sevastopol and will impose additional sanctions on Russia. They are committed to intensifying targeted sanctions and measures to increase the costs of Russia's actions. However, they also emphasize that the door remains open to a diplomatic resolution of the crisis based on the Geneva accord and urge Russia to commit to that path.
