President Biden has announced his intent to nominate three new Court of Appeals nominees and three new District Court nominees. The nominees bring deep credentials and qualifications to the federal bench, as well as a career-long devotion to the Constitution and the rule of law. This is President Biden's third slate of judicial nomination announcements, and he has now put forward a total of 20 names for federal judicial vacancies. The nominees represent the excellence and diversity of the nation with respect to both personal and professional backgrounds.

The nominees for the United States Court of Appeals are Gustavo A. Gelpí, Jr. for the First Circuit, Eunice C. Lee for the Second Circuit, and Veronica S. Rossman for the Tenth Circuit. Gustavo A. Gelpí, Jr. is currently a federal judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and has served as chief judge of the court since 2018. Eunice C. Lee is an Assistant Federal Defender with the Federal Defenders of New York, and Veronica S. Rossman has served as Senior Counsel to the Office of the Federal Public Defender for the Districts of Colorado and Wyoming since 2017.

The nominees for the United States District Court are Angel Kelley for the District of Massachusetts, Lauren J. King for the Western District of Washington, and Karen M. Williams for the District of New Jersey. Angel Kelley has served as an Associate Judge on the Massachusetts state court since 2009. Lauren J. King is a principal at Foster Garvey, P.C. in Seattle, Washington, and Karen M. Williams has served as a U.S. Magistrate Judge for the U.S. District Court in the District of New Jersey since 2009.

President Biden has a long-standing commitment to strengthening the federal bench, and his judicial nominations have been moving at a historically fast pace. His first announcement of candidates for the judiciary was made faster than any new President in modern American history. These nominations further continue that trend.
