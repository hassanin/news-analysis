On July 29, 2010, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 4899, also known as the "Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010," provides additional funding for ongoing military, diplomatic, and intelligence operations. It also supports individuals and communities affected by major disasters, helps with ongoing humanitarian work in Haiti following the earthquake, and enables the response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. 

The second bill, H.R. 5610, known as the "Independent Living Centers Technical Adjustment Act," requires a change in how funds for independent living centers under the Rehabilitation Act are allocated in certain states.
