President Obama released a statement on the death of Pat Summitt, the legendary Tennessee basketball coach. He praised her unparalleled success, including never having a losing season in her 38-year coaching career and achieving a 100 percent graduation rate among her players. He highlighted her impact on generations of young women and men, who admired her competitiveness and found confidence in themselves because of her. The President also emphasized Summitt's role in advancing equality in American athletics, as she started playing and coaching before women's basketball was recognized as a sport. He mentioned her patriotism, Olympic achievements, and her fight against Alzheimer's disease. President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama extended their condolences to Summitt's family, former players, and fans.
