White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs gave a briefing on April 30, 2009, providing updates on a case of the H1N1 influenza strain. An individual who traveled to Mexico City with the US delegation accompanying the President to Mexico City developed flu-like symptoms. Three members of the individual's family also tested positive for Type A influenza, and tests were being conducted to determine if they had contracted the H1N1 strain. The individual's family members experienced mild to moderate symptoms and have since recovered. Gibbs provided a timeline of the individual's symptoms and actions and stated that it was highly unlikely that others who were on the trip were infected. He also addressed questions about the Vice President's comments on the swine flu and the President's confidence in the Chrysler bankruptcy deal. Gibbs mentioned that the President believes the deal is in the best interest of all those involved and that it will put Chrysler on a path towards viability without continued government assistance. The briefing also touched on topics such as job creation, the Iraq war, and the economic stimulus package.
