The President strongly supports women's right to make their own reproductive health choices and believes that the Roe v. Wade decision should not be overturned. The recent action taken by the Oklahoma legislature to restrict these rights is seen as an extreme effort to undermine reproductive rights. Furthermore, this action also mirrors Texas' controversial law that allows private citizens to sue individuals who provide reproductive health care. This is part of a wider movement by ultra MAGA (Make America Great Again) officials to roll back various freedoms in the country. The President emphasizes that not only reproductive rights, but also other fundamental rights such as contraception and marriage equality, are at risk. The President is committed to defending these constitutional rights and protecting Americans' freedoms.
