The Trump Administration has announced that the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) plans to award two of its largest grants ever for infrastructure projects in Puerto Rico. FEMA will award almost $13 billion to help rebuild Puerto Rico's electrical grid system and the territory's education system. This funding includes a Federal share of $11.6 billion. The grants exceed the total Public Assistance funding in any single federally-declared disaster other than Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy. The funding will allow the Puerto Rico Electrical Power Authority to repair and replace transmission and distribution lines, substations, power generation systems, and make other grid improvements. The grant for the Puerto Rico Department of Education will focus on restoring school buildings and educational facilities. The grants are funded under FEMA's Public Assistance Alternative Procedures, allowing Puerto Rican officials to work with FEMA to determine the best way to meet their recovery needs. This brings the total Federal Government obligation for Puerto Rico's recovery from Hurricane Maria to approximately $26 billion.
