Since President Donald J. Trump's election, economic indicators have responded positively to his pro-growth agenda. In the first full month of his administration, the United States economy has shown promising progress in the job market. Trump is implementing policies that favor American workers and has taken steps to cut government red tape to promote job creation. He has also worked closely with the private sector to encourage companies to reinvest in America. Trump campaigned on jumpstarting the country's economic engine to help businesses grow and get Americans back to work.
