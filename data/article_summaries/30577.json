The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the State of California for obstructing federal law and prioritizing the interests of criminal aliens over American citizens.

This policy puts innocent Americans and law enforcement officers at risk. The article provides examples of dangerous criminal aliens that California has released despite the requests of immigration authorities.
