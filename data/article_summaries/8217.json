Illinois has become the ninth state in the US to pass an assault weapons ban. President Biden commended the leadership of Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and other officials for taking action to keep weapons of war off the streets. The President has been advocating for stronger gun control measures, including federal laws requiring background checks for all gun sales and a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. He also urges other states to follow suit and implement similar bans to save lives.
