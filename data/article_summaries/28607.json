President Donald Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum on February 19, 2020, titled "Developing and Delivering More Water Supplies in California." The memorandum addresses the need to modernize federal western water infrastructure to deliver water and power in an efficient and cost-effective way. It emphasizes the importance of enhancing water supplies while appropriately protecting species and habitats. The memorandum directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce to coordinate efforts to implement relevant authorities focused on developing water storage, capturing more water during storm events, and providing regulatory certainty to agricultural and municipal water users. It also calls for the full implementation of recent administration improvements to the management of programs established under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The Secretaries are instructed to provide quarterly updates on progress to the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality and other components of the Executive Office of the President as requested. The memorandum includes general provisions stating that it does not impair existing authorities or create any enforceable rights or benefits. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
