The author expresses gratitude to Senator Chris Murphy and members of his bipartisan group, including Senators Cornyn, Sinema, and Tillis, for their hard work on a gun safety proposal. While the author believes more is needed, they consider this proposal a significant step in the right direction and the most important gun safety legislation to pass Congress in decades. They emphasize the urgency to quickly move the proposal through the Senate and the House, as every day that passes results in more children being killed. The author looks forward to signing the proposal and using its measures to save lives.
