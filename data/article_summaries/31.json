The White House has released fact sheets on the American Families Plan, which is a proposed investment in education, healthcare, and childcare. The fact sheets highlight the benefits of the plan, such as free community college and universal pre-K, as well as the high costs of childcare and the lack of access to paid family leave. They also mention the tax cuts and credits that families and workers would receive. There are individual fact sheets for each state, territory, and the District of Columbia, as well as fact sheets on racial equity and support for rural communities.
