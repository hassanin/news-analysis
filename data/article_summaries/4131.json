The Paycheck Fairness Act has been passed by the House of Representatives, which is being applauded. The article emphasizes that closing the gender pay gap is not just an economic necessity but also a moral imperative. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, enacted twelve years ago, was an important tool for addressing pay discrimination, but pay equity has not yet been achieved in America. Women in over 90 percent of occupations still earn less than men. The article provides statistics on the earnings of different groups of women compared to white men. The Paycheck Fairness Act aims to address wage gaps by closing loopholes that have allowed employers to justify pay disparities, strengthening provisions for holding employers accountable for pay discrimination, and making it easier for workers to challenge pay disparities as a group. It also prohibits the use of salary history in hiring and setting wages and promotes pay transparency by requiring employers to report pay data and protecting workers from retaliation for discussing their wages. The article argues that equal pay is about justice and fairness and calls for swift action from the Senate to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.
