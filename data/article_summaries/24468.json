The President expresses his satisfaction with the start of polling for the Southern Sudan Referendum and congratulates the people of Southern Sudan for taking control of their own future. This marks an important milestone in implementing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement that ended the civil war between north and south. The international community is committed to ensuring that all parties fulfill their obligations. The President urges that voters be allowed access to polling stations without intimidation or coercion. He also calls for an end to violence in the Abyei region and cautions against inflammatory rhetoric or actions that could escalate tensions or hinder voter expression. While a successful vote will be a cause for celebration, there is still much work to be done to ensure security and dignity for the people of Sudan. The United States remains fully committed to assisting the parties in resolving post-referendum issues, regardless of the vote's outcome.
