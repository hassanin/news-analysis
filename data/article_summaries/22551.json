The White House has released a National Action Plan to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Antibiotic resistance is a growing concern as it undermines our ability to treat bacterial infections and perform medical procedures. The plan outlines steps to enhance domestic and international capacity to prevent and contain outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant infections, maintain the efficacy of current and new antibiotics, and develop new diagnostics, antibiotics, vaccines, and therapeutics. The plan focuses on five goals: slowing the emergence of resistant bacteria and preventing their spread, strengthening national surveillance efforts, advancing the development and use of rapid diagnostic tests, accelerating research and development for new antibiotics and therapeutics, and improving international collaboration and capacities. The plan aims to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, establish antimicrobial stewardship programs, improve disease surveillance, develop rapid diagnostic tests, advance the development of new antibiotics, and strengthen global efforts to combat antibiotic resistance.
