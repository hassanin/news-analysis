The article discusses the performance of the transportation and logistics supply chain in handling the increase in demand for goods as the economy recovers from the pandemic. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have seen a significant increase in the number of imported containers, with a total of 8.6 million imported between January and October, surpassing the previous record in 2018. The ports have also reduced the number of containers sitting on the docks for more than 9 days, improving overall efficiency. Retail inventories have grown and the availability of consumer-packaged goods is close to pre-pandemic levels. The private sector, including companies like FedEx, Target, and Walmart, has played a crucial role in successfully moving products and ensuring a smooth supply chain during the holiday season. To increase velocity and reduce congestion, the ports have imposed a congestion fee on ocean carriers and have also focused on clearing empty containers from the docks. Agricultural exports have seen an increase, particularly non-containerized exports, but container volumes for agricultural exports have decreased. The rise in shipping costs has led to a higher percentage of exported containers being empty, which raises concerns about fair treatment for American exporters and importers in the shipping industry. The Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) has been encouraged to enforce fair competition and investigate excessive shipping fees. Congress is also urged to provide more resources to the FMC and update shipping laws to protect exporters, importers, and consumers. These reforms would enhance America's global competitiveness and strengthen the transportation and logistics supply chain.
