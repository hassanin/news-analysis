President Joe Biden has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran, which was declared in 1995, will continue beyond March 15, 2021. The President cites the actions and policies of the Iranian government as posing an ongoing threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. As a result, comprehensive sanctions against Iran will remain in effect to address this threat.
