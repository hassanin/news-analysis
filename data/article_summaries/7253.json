On October 8, 2021, the President signed two bills into law. The first one is S. 1828, also known as the "HAVANA Act of 2021." This law authorizes payments to specified agency personnel and their families who have suffered brain injuries during assignments related to hostilities. The second law is S. 1917, the "K-12 Cybersecurity Act of 2021." This law requires the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to study the cybersecurity risks faced by elementary and secondary schools and develop voluntary guidelines to help schools address those risks. The President expressed gratitude to the Senators and Representatives who led these bills through the legislative process.
