The Trump Administration has released a new National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan to enhance America's preparedness for space weather events, such as solar storms and flares. The plan aims to improve the nation's resiliency and includes three main objectives: 1) enhance space weather prediction capabilities, 2) protect critical infrastructure and national security, and 3) improve coordination and information sharing. The plan builds upon previous efforts and reflects the government's commitment to space weather readiness. The President also signed an Executive Order on Coordinating National Resilience to Electromagnetic Pulses, including those caused by space weather. Implementing this plan will contribute to America's overall resilience and leadership in space.
