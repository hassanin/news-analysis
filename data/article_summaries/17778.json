The White House issued a proclamation declaring October as National Domestic Violence Awareness Month in 2009. The proclamation emphasizes the devastating impact of domestic violence on individuals of all backgrounds and calls for increased efforts to end violence within homes, communities, and the country. It highlights the need for immediate support and assistance for victims, including safe shelter, medical care, access to justice, and economic opportunities. The proclamation also emphasizes the importance of addressing domestic violence among young victims and calls for education on healthy relationships and changing attitudes that support violence. The proclamation encourages community leaders to raise awareness and urges victims and their families to seek help through the National Domestic Violence Hotline.
