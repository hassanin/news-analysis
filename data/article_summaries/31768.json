President Donald J. Trump has approved a new strategy for Iran, which aims to protect American security. The strategy includes the following core elements: recognizing the nature of the Iranian regime under Supreme Leader Khamenei, addressing the threats posed by the Iranian regime, implementing a comprehensive strategy, countering the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and addressing the Iranian nuclear program and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The strategy calls on the entire world to join the United States in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction.
