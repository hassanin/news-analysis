This article is a presidential memorandum from February 20, 2015, in which President Barack Obama determines that certain provisions of the Arms Export Control Act and Title 10 of the U.S. Code would impede national security objectives by limiting the provision of assistance to vetted elements of the Syrian opposition. He waives these provisions to allow the Department of Defense, in coordination with the Department of State, to carry out the purposes of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. The memorandum authorizes the Secretary of Defense to report this determination to Congress and publish it in the Federal Register.
