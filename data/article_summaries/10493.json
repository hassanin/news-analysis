This executive order, signed by President Barack Obama on November 29, 2016, aims to provide for the appointment of certain employees of the Foreign Service in the competitive service. The order states that the recruitment and retention of these employees are critical for meeting consular staffing levels and enhancing national security standards. The order allows for the appointment of individuals who have served for at least 48 months in the Foreign Service and have passed the prescribed examination. To be eligible for noncompetitive appointment, these individuals must have received a satisfactory performance rating and exercise their eligibility within a year after completing their Limited Non-Career Appointment. The order also specifies that disqualifying criteria for appointment in the competitive service would also apply to appointment under this order. The Office of Personnel Management is authorized to issue additional regulations as needed for implementation. The order does not affect the authority of executive departments or agencies, nor does it create any enforceable rights or benefits.
