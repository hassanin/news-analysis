President Obama is urging Congress to take action on a "To Do List" that aims to create jobs and restore middle class security. The initiatives in the list have bipartisan support and are aimed at building a strong economy that creates secure American jobs. The list includes measures such as rewarding American jobs by eliminating tax incentives to ship jobs overseas, cutting red tape to allow responsible homeowners to refinance, investing in a new hire tax credit for small businesses, creating jobs by investing in affordable clean energy, and putting returning veterans to work using the skills developed in the military. The article also provides examples of how the President's plan would deny tax breaks for moving operations abroad and reward businesses bringing jobs back to the United States.
