The White House has launched "The Opportunity Project," an open data initiative aimed at improving economic mobility for all Americans. The project will provide data and tools to civic leaders, community organizations, and families to help them access information about critical resources such as jobs, housing, transportation, schools, and neighborhood amenities. The initiative includes the release of a package of federal and local datasets, as well as the development of new digital tools by private sector and non-profit organizations. The project also calls on the public to develop new tools and offer additional sources of data. The goal is to use data and technology to address inequities and strengthen communities.
