President Donald J. Trump has expelled numerous Russian intelligence officers from the United States and closed the Russian consulate in Seattle. This decision was made due to the consulate's proximity to a submarine base and Boeing. The United States took this action in coordination with NATO allies and partners worldwide in response to Russia's use of a military-grade chemical weapon in the United Kingdom. These measures aim to enhance national security by reducing Russia's ability to spy on Americans and carry out covert operations. The United States and its allies emphasize that Russia's actions will have consequences and express a willingness to improve relations with Russia, contingent upon a change in the Russian government's behavior.
