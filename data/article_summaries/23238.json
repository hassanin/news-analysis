The White House has released a fact sheet highlighting the progress made in expanding college opportunity for all students, especially disadvantaged students. President Obama has made historic progress in increasing college opportunity, affordability, and completion by doubling investments in Pell Grants and tax credits, making student loans more affordable, and promoting innovation and competition to bring down costs and improve college quality. Through the President and First Lady's Call-to-Action on College Opportunity, schools, organizations, and counselors have helped students access more than $5 billion in financial aid, enrolling 1 million more students in college. First Lady Michelle Obama will be celebrating National College Signing Day as part of her Better Make Room campaign, which aims to celebrate education and provide students with the tools and resources they need to continue their education past high school. The fact sheet also outlines various commitments and initiatives aimed at expanding college opportunity and supporting student success, including efforts to make college more affordable, improve access to financial aid and college information, strengthen community colleges, and empower more students to earn college degrees.
