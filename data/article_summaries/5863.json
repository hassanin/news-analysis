The White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and the Office of Public Engagement held a "Communities in Action: Building a Better Ohio" event, where local elected officials and community leaders from Ohio spoke with senior Biden-Harris Administration officials about the benefits of President Biden's American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS and Science Act for working families in Ohio. U.S. Representative Joyce Beatty and Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff also attended the event. The Biden-Harris Administration aims to bring together various stakeholders to leverage these investments and create opportunities for working families in Ohio. This event is the first in a series of "Communities in Action" events that the White House will host to showcase the administration's impact on the American people.
