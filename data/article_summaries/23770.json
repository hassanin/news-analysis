The White House has issued a statement condemning North Korea's missile launch, stating that it is a highly provocative act that threatens regional security. The launch directly violates United Nations Security Council resolutions and undermines the global non-proliferation regime. The United States remains vigilant and committed to the security of its allies in the region, and will strengthen coordination with them in response to this threat. The statement also mentions that the international community must work together to send a clear message to North Korea that its actions have consequences. It emphasizes that North Korea's pursuit of ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons only isolates itself and that true strength comes from abiding by international norms and obligations.
