The Department of Energy (DOE) has proposed a new rule to enhance lightbulb efficiency in households, aiming to lock in long-term savings and climate benefits. This proposed rule is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to strengthen energy efficiency standards for various appliances and equipment, with the goal of reducing costs for American families. The administration has already taken 110 actions in 2022 to improve energy efficiency standards, covering a wide range of household products, commercial and industrial equipment, and buildings. These actions are expected to result in significant consumer savings, reduce carbon emissions, and lower greenhouse gas emissions over the next 30 years. The projected cumulative consumer savings from these standards would amount to $570 billion, with an average household saving at least $100 annually. The administration has also prioritized addressing outdated energy efficiency standards and has secured investments for home efficiency upgrades through legislative acts. In 2023, the DOE plans to continue its progress with additional actions to update standards for various product categories.
