In his weekly address, President Trump discussed the issue of illegal immigration and the need for stronger enforcement of immigration laws. He was joined at the White House by families who had lost loved ones to crimes committed by illegal immigrants. Trump emphasized that these deaths could have been prevented if the government had enforced immigration laws. He called on Congress to pass two bills that he campaigned on during the election: Kate's Law, which would enhance penalties for those who repeatedly enter the country illegally, and the No Sanctuary For Criminals Act, which would block federal grants to jurisdictions that protect criminal aliens. Trump expressed his gratitude to Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte for his work on these bills and urged the Senate to pass them. He stated that the legislation presents a choice between protecting American lives or shielding criminal aliens. Trump concluded by emphasizing the importance of the rule of law and the need to cherish freedom.
