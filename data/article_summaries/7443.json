President Biden spoke with Leaders Schumer and Jeffries about various topics related to the spring work period. They discussed efforts by Congressional Democrats to lower costs for hardworking families, protect essential programs, and confirm the President's nominees. They also discussed the brinkmanship of House Republicans over default and how this could harm the economy. President Biden, Leader Schumer, and Leader Jeffries agreed that they will not negotiate over default and urged Republicans to pass a clean bill, as they have done in the past. President Biden expressed readiness to negotiate over the budget once Republicans present their plan. His proposed budget aims to cut the deficit by nearly $3 trillion over 10 years, asks the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share, lowers costs for families, and invests in America. They also discussed the extreme spending cuts proposed by House Republicans, which include cuts to veterans and education, reductions in food assistance and healthcare, and outsourcing manufacturing, all to fund tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations.
