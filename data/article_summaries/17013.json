President Barack Obama will award Lieutenant Colonel (Ret.) Charles Kettles the Medal of Honor for his actions during combat in Vietnam in 1967. Kettles, serving as a Flight Commander, led a platoon of UH-1Ds to provide support to the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division during an ambush by enemy forces. After evacuating the wounded, Kettles returned without additional aerial support to rescue a squad-sized element of stranded soldiers pinned down by enemy fire. He is credited with saving the lives of 40 soldiers and four of his own crew members. Kettles' personal background includes being drafted into the Army at age 21 while studying engineering at Michigan State Normal College. He continued his service in the Army Reserve and volunteered for active duty in 1963. Kettles retired from the Army in 1978 and went on to complete his bachelor's and master's degrees before working for Chrysler Pentastar Aviation until his retirement in 1993. Kettles currently resides in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who distinguish themselves conspicuously by gallantry above and beyond the call of duty. The meritorious conduct must involve great personal bravery or self-sacrifice, and there must be incontestable proof of the performance of the meritorious conduct.
