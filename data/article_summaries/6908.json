Today's report indicates that progress is being made in reducing inflation without sacrificing economic growth and job creation. The economic plan in place is yielding results and positioning the United States well in the face of global economic challenges. While it will take time to return inflation to normal levels, efforts will continue to assist families with the cost of living. Notably, gas prices have decreased by approximately $1.20 per gallon compared to the summer. The report also highlights a much-needed break in grocery store inflation as the holiday season approaches. Additionally, Americans shopping for health insurance plans continue to save $800 per year due to legislation that has been enacted. In less than eight weeks, a plan to lower prescription drug prices and energy costs will come into effect. Despite the challenging past two years, the economy has reopened, new jobs are being created, and new businesses are flourishing. Efforts to control inflation are showing progress, with further measures on the horizon. The President is willing to collaborate with Democrats and Republicans to provide relief to middle-class and working families and opposes any actions that would undo the agenda or worsen inflation. The focus remains on building an economy that supports the bottom-up and middle-out approach.
