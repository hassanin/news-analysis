President Barack Obama has vetoed the "Presidential Allowance Modernization Act of 2016" (H.R. 1777), which aimed to reform the pensions and allowances provided to former Presidents in order to reduce costs to taxpayers. While the President agrees with the goal of the bill, he believes that if implemented as drafted, it would have unintended consequences. The bill would impose burdens on the offices of former Presidents, such as immediately terminating salaries and benefits of office employees and removing furnishings and equipment from offices. It would also negatively impact the operations and security of former Presidents. The President states that his Administration will work with the authors of the bill and other leaders in Congress, along with the offices of former Presidents, to find the best ways to achieve these goals. He would be willing to sign the bill if Congress addresses these concerns appropriately.
