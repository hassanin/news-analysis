The proclamation acknowledges the horrific crimes committed during the Holocaust and the need to remember and learn from them. It also celebrates the survivors and those who rescued them, highlighting their resilience and the power of hope and forgiveness. The proclamation calls on the American people to observe the Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust and to honor the memory of the victims by studying, praying, and commemorating the Holocaust, in order to prevent such atrocities from happening again.
