This article discusses the Obama Administration's efforts to honor and support military families and veterans. The President outlined five priorities: ensuring veterans receive the resources they deserve, delivering promised healthcare, ending the claims backlog, protecting wounded warriors' rights, and providing opportunities for veterans to pursue the American Dream. The Administration has taken various steps to achieve these goals, including creating tax credits for hiring veterans, improving the military's transition program, streamlining civilian credentialing, and launching the Joining Forces Initiative to encourage private sector hiring. The Administration also focuses on providing education opportunities for veterans, improving mental health care, and fighting for the resources veterans deserve. They have made progress in reducing the VA claims backlog and modernizing the system. Additionally, efforts have been made to protect the dignity and rights of wounded warriors and combat veteran homelessness.
