In this statement, the President expresses gratitude to the Senate for progressing in their efforts to reduce gun violence. The Senate has advanced a bill that aims to reinstate and strengthen a ban on the sale of military-style assault weapons and establish a limit of 10 rounds for magazines. The President argues that these weapons and high-capacity magazines are designed for the battlefield and should not be present on the streets, in schools, or used against law enforcement officers. The President urges the full Senate and the House to vote on this bill, as well as other measures that have been proposed to penalize those who buy guns for criminals, enhance school safety, and prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands. The President emphasizes that each of these proposals should receive a fair vote.
