Senior White House staff met with state legislators, governors' office staff, and other state leaders to discuss the implementation of enhanced background checks for individuals under the age of 21 as part of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. These background checks have already prevented hundreds of firearms transfers to ineligible individuals. The U.S. Department of Justice explained the process of these enhanced background checks during the meeting. The White House urged state leaders to take three actions to help implement these enhanced background checks. Representatives from 33 states attended the meeting. Moving forward, the White House will continue to collaborate with state leaders to implement enhanced background checks and other strategies to reduce gun violence.
