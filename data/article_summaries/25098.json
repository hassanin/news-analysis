President Donald J. Trump is closely monitoring Hurricane Harvey and the response efforts of State, local, and Federal officials. He received a briefing from FEMA Administrator Brock Long, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke, Thomas P. Bossert (Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Advisor), and John F. Kelly (Chief of Staff). The President spoke with Governors Greg Abbott of Texas and John Bel Edwards of Louisiana and committed to providing assistance. The President urges people in the storm's path to listen to local and State officials and prioritize safety. Those who ignore evacuation orders could endanger themselves and first responders. The public is encouraged to be prepared by visiting Ready.gov for preparedness plans and important links to information.
