Several members of the House of Representatives have expressed their support for President Trump's efforts to enforce immigration laws and secure the U.S.-Mexico border. They highlight the decrease in illegal border crossings since Trump took office and emphasize the need for stronger immigration laws and tools to combat drug trafficking and human smuggling. The House has passed bills such as the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act and Kate's Law, which target sanctuary cities and increase penalties for deported criminals who re-enter the U.S. illegally. The representatives call on the Senate to pass these bills and provide the Trump administration with the necessary tools to enforce immigration laws. They also applaud Trump's commitment to border security and pledge to continue working with him on this issue.
