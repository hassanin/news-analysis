The article discusses the actions taken by President Donald J. Trump's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to implement energy independence priorities. The EPA has proposed the repeal of the "Clean Power Plan" in line with the President's Executive Order on Energy Independence. Additionally, EPA Administrator Pruitt has launched a task force to streamline and improve the Superfund program, responsible for cleaning up land contaminated by hazardous waste. The EPA has also re-launched the Smart Sectors Program to partner with the private sector in achieving better environmental outcomes. These actions aim to end intrusive EPA regulations that harm jobs, family farmers, ranchers, and increase energy prices.
