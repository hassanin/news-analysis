President Barack Obama has proclaimed November 15, 2012, as America Recycles Day. This day is meant to highlight the importance of conserving valuable materials, keeping communities clean, and protecting the environment. Recycling plays a significant role in achieving these goals by diverting old products from landfills and putting them back into use. It also helps to reduce the environmental impact of using virgin materials. In addition to recycling, the proclamation also emphasizes the issue of food waste. Many Americans lack access to regular, nutritious meals, while a significant amount of food goes to waste in the country. The Environmental Protection Agency is partnering with businesses and organizations in the Food Recovery Challenge to address this issue through food donation and waste reduction. The proclamation encourages individuals to consume carefully and donate surplus food to food banks and pantries. President Obama calls upon the people of the United States to observe America Recycles Day with appropriate programs and activities and to continue their efforts in reducing, reusing, and recycling throughout the year.
