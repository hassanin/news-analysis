President Obama has declared a major disaster in Oregon and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following a severe winter storm, flooding, mudslides, landslides, and debris flows that occurred from January 13-21, 2011. The declaration makes federal funding available to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The counties of Clackamas, Clatsop, Crook, Douglas, Lincoln, and Tillamook are specifically mentioned as areas eligible for assistance. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding. Dolph A. Diemont has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
