The Director of National Drug Control Policy, James Carroll, has issued a statement regarding China's announcement to add fentanyl to its list of controlled substances, effective May 1. Carroll emphasizes that tens of thousands of Americans die each year from fentanyl-related drug overdoses, with much of the drug originating from China. He states that it is crucial for China to follow through on their pledge to schedule all fentanyl-related drugs as a class and crackdown on producers of these substances. Carroll asserts that the United States will continue to work with international partners to prevent lethal drugs like fentanyl from entering American communities.
