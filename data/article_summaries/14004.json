In this press briefing, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest discusses a range of topics including gun control, the omnibus bill, climate change negotiations in Paris, and Donald Trump. Earnest defends President Obama's call for a no-fly, no-buy loophole in gun control, criticizes Republicans for using the budget process to push their ideological agenda, and calls out Trump for his offensive and disqualifying comments. He also discusses the ongoing negotiations in Paris and the President's support for a political transition in Syria. Earnest emphasizes that the President is closely following the negotiations and has been in touch with world leaders about the issue. Additionally, he addresses the issue of anti-LGBT persecution by ISIS and explains that while the US does not set aside specific quotas for LGBT refugees, it prioritizes the cases of those who have been subjected to torture or have been singled out as minorities.
