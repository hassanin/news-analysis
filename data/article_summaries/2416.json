President Biden will announce funding to rebuild some of the nation's most economically significant bridges during his visit to Covington, Kentucky. The funding comes from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which invests $40 billion to repair and rebuild bridges, making it the largest investment in bridges since the construction of the Eisenhower-era Interstate Highway System. The announcement includes over $2 billion in investments for ten economically significant bridges and over 15,000 additional bridges nationwide. The projects funded by the law will adhere to Davis-Bacon requirements, ensuring that construction workers receive good pay and benefits. Bridges are crucial for connecting people and communities, facilitating commerce, and enabling first responders to reach their destinations quickly. Currently, around 43,000 bridges in the US are rated in poor condition. The announcement also includes the first year of Large Bridge Project Grants, which will fund bridges with a total cost of over $100 million. The President's economic plan has been leading to private sector investment and job creation in various industries, including manufacturing, clean energy, and the digital economy. The Bridge Investment Program, funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, will allocate $12.5 billion for planning and construction projects over five years, supporting at least one project in every state. Additionally, the US Department of Transportation has announced over $11 billion in investments for bridge repair and replacement through other programs funded by the law.
