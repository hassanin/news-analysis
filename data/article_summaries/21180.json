President Obama has issued a proclamation declaring November 9, 2015, as World Freedom Day. This day commemorates the fall of the Berlin Wall 26 years ago and celebrates the victory of democratic rule over corrupt dictatorships. The proclamation honors those who fought for progress and reunification, and expresses support for people around the world who still face obstacles to a better future. The proclamation also reflects on the shared history and friendship between the United States and Germany, and calls on people to continue supporting those who struggle against tyranny and seek liberty.
