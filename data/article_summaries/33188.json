The United States has signed an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement with Poland, marking a historic moment. This agreement follows two joint declarations signed by President Trump and President Duda last year and aims to enhance military cooperation between the two countries. The agreement includes an increase in the United States military presence in Poland, which will strengthen NATO deterrence and bolster European security. The goal is to protect US forces, increase their capabilities, and promote democracy, freedom, and sovereignty. The agreement is also seen as a model for other nations in terms of equitable burden sharing. President Trump expressed gratitude to President Duda, the Polish people, and his administration for their efforts in making this agreement a reality. The United States is looking forward to implementing the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement with Poland and continuing their important work together.
