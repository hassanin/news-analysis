The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act (VAWA) has been introduced in the House of Representatives, and there is a call for bipartisan support to ensure its swift passage in both the House and the Senate. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risks of abuse and barriers to safety for women, with domestic violence being referred to as a pandemic within the pandemic. The original Violence Against Women Act was championed to address domestic violence as an abuse of power, despite initial resistance. VAWA has been reauthorized three times with bipartisan support, and studies have shown a significant decline in domestic violence rates since its implementation. However, there is still more work to be done in preventing and responding to domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking. In 2019, the House of Representatives passed the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2019 with bipartisan support, but it was not brought to a vote in the Senate. The article emphasizes that ending gender-based violence should not be a partisan issue but a matter of justice and compassion. The author urges Congress to come together in a strong bipartisan coalition for the swift passage of VAWA.
