In this statement, President Obama discusses the reorganization of the White House to better address issues of homeland security and counterterrorism. He highlights the need for a response that integrates all aspects of American power, as the challenges of the 21st century are increasingly unconventional and transnational. 

Key decisions include the full integration of White House staff supporting national security and homeland security under the new "National Security Staff," the maintenance of the Homeland Security Council as the main venue for interagency deliberations on security issues, the establishment of new directorates and positions within the National Security Staff to address emerging challenges, the retention of the position of Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism as the principal advisor, and the creation of a new Global Engagement Directorate to drive comprehensive engagement policies. 

Overall, these changes aim to effectively leverage the talent and expertise within the White House to keep the country safe and secure.
