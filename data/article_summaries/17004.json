During a press gaggle aboard Air Force One, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs informed President Obama that Mark Buehrle had pitched a no-hitter in a baseball game. The President called Buehrle to congratulate him and joked that it was because he wore a White Sox jacket at the All-Star Game. Gibbs also mentioned that the President had spoken to Buehrle at the All-Star Game and found the achievement extraordinary as a fan. Gibbs ended the gaggle by saying he would return to discuss a fundraiser.
