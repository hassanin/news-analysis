President Biden is set to welcome Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, Chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, to the White House on June 25, 2021. The visit will emphasize the lasting partnership between the United States and Afghanistan as the military drawdown continues. The US remains committed to supporting Afghanistan through diplomatic, economic, and humanitarian assistance, with a focus on Afghan women, girls, and minorities. The US also aims to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for terrorist groups that pose a threat to the US homeland. The US fully supports the ongoing peace process and encourages all Afghan parties to engage in negotiations to bring an end to the conflict.
