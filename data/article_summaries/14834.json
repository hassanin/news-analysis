The White House Press Secretary released a statement expressing concern about a bill passed in the House that would potentially lead to another debt ceiling crisis in a few months if certain conditions were not met. The bill has been declared dead on arrival in the Senate. The statement calls for immediate action and cooperation from leaders to reach a compromise that avoids default and reduces the deficit. Senator Reid's proposal is seen as a potential basis for compromise as it achieves more deficit reduction than the House bill and removes uncertainty surrounding the risk of default. The President urges Democrats and Republicans in the Senate to find common ground on a plan that can be supported by both parties in the House and signed by Tuesday.
