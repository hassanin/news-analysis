This article is a presidential memorandum issued by Donald J. Trump on January 19, 2021. The memorandum is titled "Declassification of Certain Materials Related to the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane Investigation." In the memorandum, Trump directs the declassification and release of materials related to the FBI's investigation. He states that he requested these documents to perform a declassification review and determine to what extent they should be released in unclassified form. Trump determines that the materials should be declassified to the maximum extent possible, except for certain materials that need to be protected from disclosure. The FBI objected to further declassification and proposed redactions, which Trump accepts. He directs the Attorney General to implement the proposed redactions and return a redacted copy to the White House. The memorandum also includes general provisions, stating that it should be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. It clarifies that the memorandum does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party. Finally, Trump authorizes the Attorney General to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
