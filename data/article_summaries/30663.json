President Donald Trump has declared a major disaster in the state of Tennessee and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following severe storms, tornadoes, winds, and flooding from April 12 to April 13, 2020. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in the counties of Bradley and Hamilton. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for emergency work, facility repair or replacement, and hazard mitigation measures in several other counties. Myra M. Shird has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing, and additional counties may receive assistance once assessments are completed. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance through the DisasterAssistance.gov website or by phone. The toll-free numbers will be available seven days a week from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. local time. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
