President Obama has declared a major disaster for the Soboba Band of Luise√±o Indians and authorized federal aid to help the tribe recover from severe storms, flooding, and mudslides that occurred in December 2014. The federal funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. Rosalyn L. Cole has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for the recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
