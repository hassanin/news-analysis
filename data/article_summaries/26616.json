On October 4, 2019, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation addressing the issue of healthcare costs incurred by uninsured individuals and immigrants in the United States. The proclamation states that healthcare providers and taxpayers bear significant costs for medical expenses of people without health insurance or the ability to pay. These costs are passed on to the American people in the form of higher taxes, higher premiums, and higher fees for medical services. Uncompensated care costs have exceeded $35 billion in each of the last 10 years, putting a strain on hospitals and driving some into insolvency. The proclamation emphasizes that the United States has a long history of welcoming immigrants, but it is necessary to address the challenges facing the healthcare system and protect the American taxpayer from the burdens of uncompensated care. Therefore, the proclamation suspends and limits the entry of immigrants who may financially burden the U.S. healthcare system, unless they are covered by approved health insurance within 30 days of entry or possess the financial resources to pay for medical costs. The proclamation provides a list of approved health insurance plans and programs. It also outlines exceptions to the entry limitations, such as for immigrants holding valid visas issued before the proclamation's effective date and those seeking entry based on family relationships or for law enforcement purposes. The proclamation establishes reporting requirements to assess the continued necessity of the entry limitations and protect the integrity of the healthcare system. It also includes provisions for implementation, enforcement, severability, and general provisions. The proclamation is effective from November 3, 2019.
