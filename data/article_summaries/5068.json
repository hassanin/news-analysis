Speaker McCarthy has made a deal with extreme MAGA members of his party to take away food assistance from older Americans and protect certain industries from budget cuts. This agreement does not address provisions that will harm veterans' healthcare, access to Meals on Wheels, healthcare coverage for millions, and the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs. House Republicans are prioritizing restoring the Trump tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations, which will cost over $3 trillion. President Biden, on the other hand, will not sacrifice opportunity and economic security for working and middle-class families to fund tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations. House Republicans' budget choices reveal their priorities and who they are fighting for.
