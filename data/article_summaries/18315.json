Dr. George Cooper, the Executive Director of the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), has passed away. Born in Tallahassee, Florida, Dr. Cooper had a deep love for education and HBCUs. He dedicated his life to ensuring that students at these institutions received a quality education and had the necessary resources to succeed. Dr. Cooper served on the faculty at several universities and worked with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture for 17 years. His passing is a great loss for the HBCU and higher education communities, as well as for those who knew him. The President and First Lady extend their condolences to his wife, Diane, and his family and friends.
