President Donald J. Trump has signed an Executive Order titled "Coordinating National Resilience to Electromagnetic Pulses." The order aims to enhance resilience to Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) events by improving data gathering, testing, and private-sector coordination to implement protective measures. It also instructs departments and agencies to streamline these efforts and promote private-sector innovation in strengthening critical infrastructure. This is the first-ever comprehensive policy established to improve resilience to EMPs and is part of the Administration's commitment to ensuring the safety of Americans.
