The United States strongly condemns the Taliban's decision to prevent Afghan women from receiving a university-level education. This is part of a larger effort by the Taliban to impose more restrictions on women in Afghanistan and deny them their human rights. The US believes that this decision will further isolate the Taliban from the international community and undermine their legitimacy. The US is working with its partners and allies to address this issue and support Afghan women and girls, as well as provide humanitarian aid to the people of Afghanistan.
