The article is a letter from President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to the Senate of the United States. In the letter, President Biden transmits the Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of Finland and Sweden for the Senate's advice and consent for ratification. The Protocols were signed on July 5, 2022, and their ratification will allow Finland and Sweden to become members of NATO. The letter highlights that Finland and Sweden meet the qualifications to join NATO and will be valuable contributors to the Alliance. President Biden urges the Senate to promptly provide its advice and consent for the ratification of the Protocols, as the administration is encouraging all Allies to act expeditiously in their own ratification processes.
