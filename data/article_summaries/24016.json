During a press briefing, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Richard Cordray discussed student loans and college costs. They emphasized the importance of providing students and their parents with more transparency about college costs and loan repayment options. They also discussed the need for colleges and universities to provide clear information about financial aid options and the true cost of higher education. The officials announced that 10 universities have already agreed to adopt five data elements from a proposed shopping sheet that would provide greater transparency for prospective students and families. They called on all colleges and universities to make the same commitment to providing transparent financial data. The briefing also touched on other topics such as the death of al Qaeda's number two leader and the eurozone crisis.
