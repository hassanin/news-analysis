The 2023 White House Holiday Display is themed "Magic, Wonder, and Joy" and is designed to capture the pure delight and imagination of childhood. First Lady Jill Biden announced the theme, stating that it is inspired by how children experience the festive season. The holiday decorations aim to encourage visitors to reflect on this time of year with open hearts and embrace the magic, wonder, and joy of the holidays. The White House expects to welcome approximately 100,000 visitors during the holiday season. The decorations include an enchanting and magical Christmas tree in the East Wing, a Gold Star Tree honoring fallen service members, holiday messages in the Ground Floor Corridor, a Library honoring bedtime stories, a Vermeil Room representing music and performance, a China Room featuring flavors and scents of the season, an East Room with Advent calendars, a Green Room symbolizing peace and joy in faith, a Blue Room showcasing the official White House Christmas Tree, a Red Room celebrating holiday crafts and supporting military and veteran families, a State Dining Room with Santa's Workshop, a Gingerbread White House inspired by "Twas the Night Before Christmas," a Cross Hall featuring the official White House Menorah, and a Grand Foyer with a recreation of "Twas the Night Before Christmas." The holiday decorations were created by the Executive Residence staff and over 300 volunteers from across the country.
