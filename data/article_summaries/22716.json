President Obama received a briefing on the impacts of Hurricane Isaac and the ongoing federal response. The President directed FEMA to continue to provide support to state and local responders, including power restoration efforts once the storm clears. The President also emphasized the importance of FEMA remaining proactive in areas further inland that could be impacted by the storm. The President later held a call with the governors of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and the mayor of New Orleans to discuss the storm's impacts and the resources and steps FEMA has taken to support their teams. The President assured the governors and mayor that the federal government was prepared and would provide all necessary support and resources.
