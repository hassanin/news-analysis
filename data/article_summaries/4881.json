To combat this threat, the President has released the National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism, which aims to protect the nation while preserving civil rights and liberties. The strategy includes short-term measures to address immediate threats and long-term efforts to address the underlying causes of domestic terrorism. The President emphasizes the need for unity in rejecting domestic terrorism and eradicating the hate that fuels it. The protection of basic freedoms is not only crucial to democracy but also an advantage for the United States on the global stage.
