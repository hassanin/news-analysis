On June 16, 2020, the President signed two laws into effect. The first law is S. 2746, known as the "Law Enforcement Suicide Data Collection Act." This law establishes the Law Enforcement Officers Suicide Data Collection Program, which aims to collect data on suicides and attempted suicides among law enforcement officers. The second law is S. 3414, titled the "Major Medical Facility Authorization Act of 2020." This law authorizes several major medical facility construction projects for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and provides appropriations for carrying out these projects.
