This article discusses the efforts of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) member economies to promote energy security and clean, efficient, and sustainable energy development in the region. APEC, which accounts for about 60% of global energy demand, faces challenges due to increasing energy consumption, vulnerability to natural disasters, and climate change impacts. APEC leaders have agreed to several steps, including endorsing a goal to double the share of renewable energy in the region's energy mix by 2030, reducing energy intensity by 45% by 2035, phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, improving emergency response mechanisms, increasing resilience of energy infrastructure, and promoting free trade in environmental goods. The initiatives aim to support the President's Climate Action Plan and address energy and climate challenges collectively.
