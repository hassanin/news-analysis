The senior administration official on Air Force One summarized President Trump's recent state visit to South Korea. The official highlighted that the visit included a historic speech by Trump to the National Assembly, in which he discussed the nature of the North Korean regime, its human rights abuses, and the international obligation to confront the threat it poses. The two presidents reaffirmed their commitment to a coordinated global pressure campaign and the use of military capabilities to defend against North Korea. Trump also emphasized that North Korea's weapons are putting the regime in greater danger, as they are designed to blackmail the US and its allies. The official mentioned that the US is open to dialogue, but North Korea has shown little interest in talks. The official also mentioned that the President will make a determination on whether to designate North Korea as a state sponsor of terror at the end of the trip. The official confirmed that the issue of North Korea will be high on the agenda during Trump's visit to China and that China needs to do more to enforce UN Security Council resolutions. The official stated that movement towards denuclearization would need to be verifiable. The official also mentioned that the President will continue to tweet while in China, despite social media platforms like Twitter being banned in the country.
