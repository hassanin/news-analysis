The White House has announced a series of executive actions aimed at reducing gun violence in the United States. The actions include measures to strengthen background checks for gun buyers, improve the efficiency of the background check system, and increase mental health treatment and reporting to the background check system. The administration also plans to invest in research and development of gun safety technology. The actions are being taken in response to the high number of gun-related deaths and injuries in the country and the failure of Congress to pass gun safety reforms. The administration is calling on Congress, states, and the private sector to support these efforts to make communities safer from gun violence.
