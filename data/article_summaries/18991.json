The White House condemns Iran's blocking of the Virtual Embassy Tehran, denying its people the freedom to access it. The Iranian government's actions demonstrate their commitment to surveillance and censorship. However, their efforts to control information are destined to fail in the 21st century, where technology empowers citizens globally. The United States remains committed to dialogue with the Iranian people, based on mutual interests and respect. The Iranian government should explain to its people why it fears their access to information.
