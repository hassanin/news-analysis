On March 30, 2022, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced the continuation of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13664 regarding the situation in and in relation to South Sudan. The national emergency was initially declared on April 3, 2014, due to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the ongoing conflict in South Sudan. The situation in South Sudan is characterized by widespread violence and atrocities, human rights abuses, recruitment and use of child soldiers, attacks on peacekeepers, and obstruction of humanitarian operations. The President determined that the national emergency must continue beyond April 3, 2022, as the situation still poses a significant threat. This continuation is in accordance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act. The notice of the continuation will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
