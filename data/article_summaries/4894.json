President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has submitted a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13288, which addresses the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe, will continue beyond March 6, 2021. The President argues that President Emmerson Mnangagwa has not implemented the necessary political and economic reforms to warrant the termination of targeted sanctions. The government security services in Zimbabwe have been accused of intimidating and violently suppressing citizens, including opposition political party members, union members, and journalists. The lack of progress in implementing fundamental reforms poses a threat to peace, security, and human rights in Zimbabwe and the region. Therefore, President Biden has determined that it is necessary to maintain the national emergency and sanctions in response to this ongoing threat.
