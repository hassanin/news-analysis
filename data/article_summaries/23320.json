This article discusses Executive Order 13541, which establishes a temporary organization called the Iraq Strategic Partnership Office (ISPO) within the Department of State. The purpose of the ISPO is to support executive departments and agencies in facilitating a strategic partnership between the US Government and the Republic of Iraq, securing and stabilizing the country, and maintaining a diplomatic presence in Iraq. The ISPO will assist with the transition to a strategic partnership, coordinate the drawdown of Provincial Reconstruction Teams, support the development of a sustainable Rule of Law mission in Iraq, and complete any remaining coordination and oversight functions for Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund monies. The ISPO will be headed by a Director selected by the Secretary of State, who will transfer personnel, assets, liabilities, and records from the Iraq Transition Assistance Office (ITAO) to the ISPO. The order will be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to appropriations. It does not affect the authority of executive departments or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The ISPO will terminate at the end of the maximum period permitted by law, unless terminated sooner by the Secretary.
