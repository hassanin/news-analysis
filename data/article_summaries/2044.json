The Biden administration is set to hold a trilateral dialogue with Japan and South Korea to discuss various topics, including the maintenance of peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic, and next steps on climate change. This meeting follows recent trips by Secretary of State Blinken and Secretary of Defense Austin to Japan and South Korea for reciprocal meetings. The meeting will take place at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and will include trilateral sessions as well as bilateral meetings between each country. The main focus of the meeting will be on reviewing and discussing the administration's policy review on North Korea, which is in its final stages. Other topics of discussion will include technology, including semiconductors and supply chains, as well as regional issues such as the situation in Myanmar and security concerns in the South China Sea. The meeting is part of an ongoing process of collaboration and consultation with Japan and South Korea on shared goals and strategies. There will likely not be a joint statement or press availability after the meeting, as it will be a private discussion. The administration hopes to have a deep, shared understanding of the circumstances and goals related to North Korea and to receive feedback and suggestions from Japan and South Korea. The proportion of engagement and pressure in the administration's North Korea policy will be discussed, but specific details have not been provided. COVID-19 will also be a topic of discussion, but engagement on health-related issues with North Korea is viewed as premature at this time. The administration is open to closer consultation and engagement with South Korea in initiatives such as the Quad, which aims to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific.
