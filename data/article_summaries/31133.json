The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is urging Americans to participate in National Prescription Drug Take Back Day on October 26. ONDCP Director Jim Carroll emphasizes the importance of preventing drug misuse and encourages the proper disposal of unused, expired, or unwanted prescription medications. Under President Trump's leadership, the administration has collaborated with public and private sector partners to collect over 4.6 million pounds of prescription drugs through Take Back Day events. In April, the public turned in 937,443 pounds of prescription drugs at various collection sites. Over 4,788 law enforcement partners and 5,725 registered sites will be available for this year's event, which will run from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. local time. The public can find a nearby collection site at www.DEATakeBack.com or by calling 800-882-9539.
