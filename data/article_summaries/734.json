President Biden has signed an Executive Order stating that all qualified Americans should be able to serve in the Armed Forces of the United States. The order emphasizes that an inclusive military strengthens national security and that gender identity should not be a barrier to military service. The decision is based on a 2016 study that found enabling transgender individuals to serve openly would have minimal impact on military readiness and healthcare costs. Testimony from top military officials and former Surgeons General also supported this stance. The executive action revokes previous memorandums that restricted transgender individuals from serving. The order directs the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Homeland Security to implement the policy and prohibits involuntary separations, discharges, and denials of reenlistment or continuation of service based on gender identity. It also requires a report from the Secretaries on their progress in implementing the directives within 60 days.
