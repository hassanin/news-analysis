In a speech at the South Court Auditorium, President Biden outlined his American Jobs Plan, which he referred to as the "backbone of America." The plan is a once-in-a-generation investment in infrastructure, aiming to rebuild the country's roads, highways, and bridges, as well as invest in future infrastructure needs like high-speed internet and clean energy. Biden emphasized that infrastructure should be seen as more than just physical structures but also as the foundation for a good economy, providing jobs and opportunities for all Americans. He called for bipartisan cooperation and compromise, stating that while he is open to good ideas and negotiations, doing nothing is not an option. The President also discussed his proposed methods for paying for the plan, including raising the corporate tax rate to 28% and implementing a global minimum tax for U.S. corporations. He stressed the importance of investing in research and development to stay competitive with other countries and highlighted the need for unity and democracy to lead the way in the 21st century.
