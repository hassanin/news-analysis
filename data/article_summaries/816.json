The article is a proclamation made by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on May 4, 2021, commemorating the 60th Anniversary of the Freedom Rides. The Freedom Rides were a series of peaceful protests against segregation that took place in 1961. Thirteen Americans, both Black and white, embarked on bus journeys to challenge racial discrimination. They faced brutal attacks from white supremacists but remained committed to nonviolence. Their courage and sacrifice inspired millions of Americans and brought attention to the issue of racial inequality. President Biden highlights the importance of continuing the work to heal the nation and addresses racial equity and systemic racism through executive orders and legislation. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to honor the Freedom Riders and those who fought for civil rights.
