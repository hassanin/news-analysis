The White House Office of the Press Secretary held a press gaggle with Principal Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz on July 23, 2014. Schultz began by discussing the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee’s unanimous vote to approve Bob McDonald as the next Secretary of the Veterans Administration. He then addressed questions about the situation in Ukraine, stating that the intelligence community is in the process of presenting evidence regarding the missile that shot down MH17. While the specific details of who fired the missile are still under investigation, it is clear that Russia has provided support to the separatists in Ukraine. Schultz also mentioned that additional sanctions on Russia are being considered and that the FAA's decision to restrict flights into Israel is strictly security-related. He then discussed the border crisis, emphasizing the need for resources to deal with the situation. Schultz also addressed questions about the President's focus on the economy during his trip and the decision to participate in super PAC events. He stated that the President is committed to helping Democrats in the midterm elections and that transparency is the responsibility of the outside groups organizing the events. Finally, Schultz mentioned the ongoing crisis in the Middle East and Secretary Kerry's efforts to broker a ceasefire. He also briefly discussed the GAO report on abuse of health subsidies and the administration's commitment to addressing fraud in the healthcare marketplace.
