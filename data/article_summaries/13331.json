The article is a statement by the Press Secretary on the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture. It highlights the United Nations Convention Against Torture, which was adopted 30 years ago and entered into effect three years later. The statement emphasizes President Obama's clear stance against torture, describing it as abhorrent, a tool of repression, and a violation of human dignity. The practice is also seen as weakening those who use it and providing recruitment opportunities for enemies. The statement reaffirms the commitment to the Convention and honors those who have suffered from torture, as well as those who have lost their lives due to it. It also expresses gratitude to governments, civil society organizations, survivors, and others working to combat torture, and promises a lasting partnership in this fight. The United States aims to achieve the noble aspirations of the Convention and create a world without torture.
