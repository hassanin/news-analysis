President Obama has directed several government departments to make changes to regulations and policies in order to reach out to the Cuban people and support their desire for freedom. The changes include allowing religious organizations to sponsor religious travel to Cuba, facilitating educational exchanges, restoring specific licensing for educational exchanges, modifying requirements for licensing academic exchanges, allowing academic institutions to sponsor seminars and workshops related to Cuba, permitting non-academic clinics and workshops, expanding the scope of journalistic activities, restoring a general license for non-family remittances, creating a general license for remittances to religious institutions, and modifying regulations for U.S. airports to serve as points of embarkation for licensed flights to Cuba. These changes aim to increase people-to-people contact, support civil society in Cuba, enhance the flow of information, and promote independence from Cuban authorities. The changes will take effect within two weeks upon publication of modified regulations.
