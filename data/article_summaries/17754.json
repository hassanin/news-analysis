Ron Bloom, the Assistant to the President for Manufacturing Policy, will be stepping down from his position at the end of August. During his time in office, Bloom helped put American automakers on the path to recovery and launched partnerships to make manufacturers more competitive. He also played a key role in setting aggressive fuel economy standards. Bloom previously served on the President's Task Force on the Automotive Industry, where he helped lead the restructuring of General Motors and Chrysler. He will be returning to Pittsburgh, PA to spend more time with his family.
