After 28 years of inaction, bipartisan members of Congress have passed legislation to address gun violence. This legislation is a response to the demands of families across the country who have been affected by tragic shootings. The bill aims to protect Americans, particularly children in schools and communities. The next step is for the House of Representatives to vote on the bill and send it to the president's desk for approval.
