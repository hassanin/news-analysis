During a press briefing, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Cecilia Rouse, discussed the state of the U.S. economy. She acknowledged that while progress is being made in restarting the economy, it will take time for it to fully recover. Rouse highlighted that different sectors of the economy will come back online at different times and paces. She also mentioned that analysts will find it difficult to accurately forecast economic data until the economy has fully recovered. Rouse emphasized the importance of focusing on trends rather than short-term fluctuations in economic data. Additionally, she discussed the recent increase in consumer prices, attributing it to factors such as supply chain issues and the rebounding of sectors hit hard by the pandemic. Rouse stated that the Biden administration is working to support displaced workers in finding suitable jobs and urged workers receiving unemployment benefits to take suitable job offers. She also mentioned the administration's efforts to address long-term structural issues in the economy.
