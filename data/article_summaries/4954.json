President Biden has authorized an increase in federal funding for public assistance projects in Alaska following an earthquake in 2018. The major disaster declaration issued in January 2019 made funding available at 75% of eligible costs. The President's order has now increased the federal share for public assistance to 90% of eligible costs. For further information, contact the FEMA news desk.
