In this article, the President addresses the issue of opioid addiction in the United States. He emphasizes the importance of combating the opioid epidemic and getting tough on drug dealers and pushers. The President encourages Americans to participate in National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, a day dedicated to preventing pill abuse and theft by disposing of expired or unneeded prescription drugs. He highlights the fact that many Americans who abuse prescription drugs get them from someone else's leftover prescriptions and that this can lead to deadly heroin addiction or the use of fentanyl-laced drugs. The President urges people to clean out their medicine cabinets and find a safe-disposal site to prevent contributing to the opioid crisis. He also mentions his visit to Joint Interagency Task Force South, a group working on drug interdiction efforts, and emphasizes the need to provide resources to Coast Guard members who are on the front lines of defending America against drug trafficking. The President concludes by expressing the importance of taking care of Americans and families.
