President Donald J. Trump has announced the establishment of the White House Office of American Innovation (OAI). The purpose of the OAI is to provide recommendations to the President on policies and plans that will improve government operations and services, enhance the quality of life for Americans, and stimulate job creation. These recommendations will be developed in collaboration with career staff, as well as private-sector and other external thought leaders. Senior Advisor Jared Kushner has been appointed to lead the OAI, along with other senior White House staff who bring diverse experiences and exceptional talent to the initiative. The OAI will address various critical issues, such as modernizing government services, improving services to veterans, developing infrastructure projects, implementing regulatory and process reforms, creating manufacturing jobs, addressing the drug and opioid epidemic, and establishing "workforce of the future" programs. The OAI aims to combine internal resources with private-sector innovation and creativity to better serve the American people.
