The President signed the PPP Extension Act of 2021 into law on March 30, 2021. This act extends the application deadline for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to May 31, 2021. It also extends the authorization for the PPP through June 30, 2021, giving the Small Business Administration more time to process applications received by the new deadline.
