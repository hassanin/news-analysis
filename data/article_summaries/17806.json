President Obama has signed an Executive Order to establish the White House Council on Strong Cities, Strong Communities (SC2). This council will expand on the SC2 pilot initiative launched in 2011, which aimed to create partnerships between federal agencies and localities to promote economic development in communities facing long-term challenges. The interagency Council, based at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, will consist of 19 federal agencies and coordinate the implementation of SC2. Currently, federal agency staff are working closely with six cities - Chester, PA; Cleveland/Youngstown, OH; Detroit, MI; Fresno, CA; Memphis, TN; and New Orleans, LA. The Council will recommend policies to the President to strengthen local economies and change federal policies and programs. Stakeholders gathered at the White House to discuss the progress of the SC2 pilot initiative. The pilot cities were selected based on economic need, strong local leadership, potential for economic growth, geographic diversity, and the ability to test the SC2 model.
