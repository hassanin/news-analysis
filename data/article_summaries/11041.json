In this op-ed, First Lady Michelle Obama discusses the global girls' education crisis. She highlights the challenges faced by girls in Liberia and Morocco, such as poverty, teen pregnancy, and limited access to schools. The First Lady emphasizes that these girls are just as deserving of an education as anyone else and that educating them not only transforms their lives but also their families, communities, and nations. She mentions the Let Girls Learn initiative launched by President Obama and herself, as well as the recent U.S. government commitments to promoting girls' education in Africa. While these efforts are important, the First Lady believes that individuals also have a responsibility to champion girls' education. She encourages people to use their platforms, such as social media, to raise awareness and take action. The First Lady concludes by expressing her commitment to continue working on behalf of these girls and invites others to join her in this mission.
