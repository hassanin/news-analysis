In this speech, Kevin Hassett, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, discusses the issue of generating causal estimates of the effect of policy changes on the economy. He emphasizes that policy changes are not random and are formulated in response to current and expected economic conditions. Therefore, looking at correlations between policy variables and economic conditions can lead to spurious estimates of how policy influences the economy. Hassett shares his own experience of studying the effects of investment tax credits and how the endogeneity of policy can drive the results.

He also discusses the evolution of recent forecast revisions and how they indicate the expected effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on economic growth. He cites various sources, such as the Blue Chip consensus forecast, the Congressional Budget Office, and the International Monetary Fund, to show that growth forecasts have been revised upwards since the passing of the tax act. Hassett argues that these revisions are consistent with the tax act having a large effect on growth expectations.

Furthermore, he mentions that exogenous tax changes in the United States have significant effects on global growth. Applying a structural vector autoregressive model, he finds that a 1 percent cut in U.S. taxes as a fraction of GDP raises growth in the European Union and the rest of the world.

Hassett concludes by highlighting the emerging effects of the tax law on investment, citing data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and indices from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. He suggests that if the investment boom continues as expected, it will mark an important moment of success for economics as a science that guides policy.
