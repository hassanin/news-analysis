The White House is preparing for the annual Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn, which is expected to welcome around 30,000 attendees. First Lady Melania Trump and President Donald J. Trump are inviting guests to participate in activities such as the traditional Egg Roll and the Trump Administration's Cards for Troops station. A new addition this year is Bowling on the South Lawn, an idea proposed by the First Lady. The event will also include entertainment, including a list of Reading Nook Readers.
