President Obama has announced a new partnership with the private sector called SupplierPay, which aims to strengthen small businesses by increasing their working capital. The initiative brings together 26 companies, both large and small, that have committed to paying small suppliers faster or helping them access lower-cost capital. This partnership builds on the success of the Federal Government's QuickPay initiative, which expedites payments to small business contractors. The President is also renewing QuickPay for federal small business subcontractors. The SupplierPay initiative and QuickPay have already generated over $1 billion in cost savings for small businesses since 2011. The article also includes case studies of companies, such as Intuit, Molina Healthcare, and Apple, that have committed to SupplierPay and have seen positive results. The President's initiatives aim to support small businesses, which play a vital role in the American economy.
