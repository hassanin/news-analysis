The leaders agreed on the need for cooperation among affected countries to address irregular migration through stronger border security and upholding the rule of law while respecting the rights of individuals who qualify for asylum. They also pledged to advance regional electricity integration and deepen energy cooperation initiatives. The United States expressed its commitment to strong bilateral ties with Costa Rica and cooperation in areas such as combating climate change, protecting the environment, promoting lawful migration, counternarcotics, and citizen security.
