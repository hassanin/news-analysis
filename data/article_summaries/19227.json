In this statement, the President of the United States acknowledges the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture and reaffirms the country's commitment to opposing torture. The President believes that brutal interrogation methods are inconsistent with American values, undermine the rule of law, and are ineffective in obtaining information. These methods also serve as a recruitment tool for terrorists and put American troops at risk. The Department of State has gathered information on mechanisms to stop torture and help victims, which will be shared with interested organizations and governments. The United States will continue to support efforts to eradicate torture through human rights training, capacity building, legislation, and collaboration with groups working to rehabilitate victims and offenders. The President expresses gratitude to those working to end torture worldwide.
