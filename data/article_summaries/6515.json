During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki announced that National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan would be giving a preview of President Biden's upcoming trip to Europe. Sullivan outlined the key objectives of the trip, which include rallying the world's democracies to tackle global challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and cyber threats. The President will participate in the G7 summit, where he will announce plans to end the pandemic and provide financing for infrastructure in developing countries. He will also address security challenges at NATO, including Russia and China. The President will have a bilateral meeting with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to reaffirm the "Special Relationship" and discuss trade and technology. After attending the G7 and NATO summits, President Biden will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva to discuss areas of cooperation and manage differences between the two countries. Sullivan emphasized that the meeting with Putin is not a reward but an essential part of defending America's interests and values. The President will return to Washington with a stronger position to manage major threats and challenges, such as COVID-19, climate change, China, cyber threats, and Russia. Psaki also provided updates on other topics, including the Affordable Care Act, gun violence prevention, and the Vice President's trip to the Northern Triangle.
