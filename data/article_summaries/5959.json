During National Youth Justice Action Month, the focus is on transforming the juvenile justice system to create safer and more supportive communities for young people. While the youth population in juvenile justice facilities has declined significantly, those who enter the system often face unsafe environments, untreated trauma and mental health conditions, and adult sentences. This disproportionately affects young people of color and those with disabilities. The Biden Administration has made historic investments in improving the youth justice system, shifting its focus from punishment to support. This includes establishing evidence-based diversion programs, expanding access to lawyers, and providing resources for rehabilitation upon release. The administration is also working to ensure equal opportunities for all children by investing in education, afterschool programs, community services, and mental health support. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to take action and participate in activities and programs that support youth during this month.
