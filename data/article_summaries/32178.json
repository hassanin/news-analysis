President Donald Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency one year ago. Since then, the Trump Administration has implemented a comprehensive approach to address the epidemic, involving various government agencies and departments. However, the government alone cannot solve this crisis, and private-sector and nonprofit organizations are also stepping up to make a difference. President Trump recently hosted 21 such organizations at the White House, highlighting their innovative and promising work. Some notable contributions include Amazon's use of Alexa voice service to provide information on opioids and addiction, Belden Industries' expansion of their rehab and employment program, and Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's establishment of treatment centers and a national hotline. Other organizations like Cigna, CVS Health, and Walgreens are focusing on improving access to treatment, medication disposal, and education. The efforts of these organizations aim to reduce opioid-related overdoses and provide support for individuals struggling with addiction.
