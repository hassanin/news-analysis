President Donald J. Trump held a listening session at the White House to hear from Americans who have experienced hardships due to Obamacare. Attendees shared their stories of cancelled health insurance, skyrocketing costs, limited networks, and high deductibles. The middle class has been particularly affected. The session included individuals from various states and backgrounds, such as a mother of six whose insurance costs increased from $17,000 to $52,500 per year, a working mother whose premiums accounted for 65% of her monthly gross income, and a farmer whose catastrophic coverage costs spiked from $119 to over $500 per month. Attendees expressed optimism that President Trump will bring free market principles to healthcare and improve the system. After hearing these stories, President Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price committed to fighting for reforms that will lower costs and increase access to care for all Americans.
