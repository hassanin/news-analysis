On July 22, 2004, former President Barack Obama declared a national emergency with respect to the former Liberian regime of Charles Taylor. This was done to address the threat posed by Taylor and his associates, who unlawfully depleted Liberian resources and removed funds and property from Liberia, undermining its transition to democracy and development. The national emergency and related measures, such as blocking the property of certain individuals connected to Taylor, were put in place under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. In this notice, President Obama states that the actions and policies of Taylor and others continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States' foreign policy. Therefore, he is extending the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
