In his speech at the virtual Leaders Summit on Climate, President Joe Biden emphasized the need for global action on climate change. He thanked world leaders for their participation and highlighted the importance of leadership on this issue. Biden emphasized that addressing climate change is not just about preserving the planet, but also about creating a better future for all. He stressed the potential for job creation and economic opportunities in the clean energy sector. Biden proposed a significant investment in American infrastructure and innovation to tap into these opportunities and ensure that workers and communities are not left behind. He mentioned various sectors that can benefit from this investment, such as building clean technology infrastructure, developing electric vehicles and charging stations, and implementing carbon capture and green hydrogen plants. He also highlighted the role of farmers in carbon innovation. Biden expressed his commitment to cutting greenhouse gas emissions in the United States by 50% by the end of the decade and achieving a net-zero emissions economy by 2050. However, he emphasized that no nation can solve the climate crisis alone, and all countries, especially the largest economies, need to step up and make bold investments in clean energy. Biden stressed the urgency of the climate crisis, stating that this is the decisive decade to make the necessary decisions to avoid the worst consequences. He highlighted the impacts of climate change, such as wildfires, floods, and heatwaves, and the need to take action to protect communities, workers, and economies. Biden called on countries to set higher climate ambitions, create jobs, advance innovative technologies, and help vulnerable countries adapt to climate impacts. He urged countries to take swift action before the Glasgow Climate Conference in November to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Biden emphasized that addressing climate change is not only a moral imperative but also an economic opportunity. He expressed confidence in the collective ability to tackle the climate crisis and thanked the participants for their commitments and contributions.
