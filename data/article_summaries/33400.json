White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders began the press briefing by reflecting on the 16th anniversary of the September 11th attacks. She highlighted the importance of the Department of Homeland Security's mission in securing the nation and responding to various threats, including terrorism and natural disasters. Sanders then introduced Tom Bossert, the President's Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Advisor, who provided an update on the response efforts to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Bossert discussed the priorities of the federal government in Florida, including lifesaving and life-sustaining operations, debris removal, power restoration, and housing solutions for those displaced by the storms. He also addressed the issue of fuel availability and price gouging. Bossert emphasized that the federal government is working closely with state and local authorities, as well as private sector entities, to ensure a coordinated and effective response. During the Q&A session, Sanders fielded questions about Steve Bannon's recent interview on "60 Minutes," the President's views on climate change, and the administration's plans to address the opioid crisis. She also addressed the ongoing debate over DACA and the prospects for tax reform.
