The United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) have released a report confirming that the Syrian regime has used industrial chlorine as a weapon against its own people, which is a violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and UN Security Council Resolution 2118. The United States, along with international partners, will seek accountability through diplomatic mechanisms, including the United Nations Security Council and the OPCW. The report also confirms that ISIS used mustard gas against civilians in Syria in August 2015. The US-led Counter-ISIL coalition is targeting ISIS's chemical weapons capabilities and removing leaders with knowledge of these weapons. The findings present an opportunity for all nations to unite against the use of chemical weapons.
