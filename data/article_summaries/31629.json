President Donald Trump has achieved another trade victory for American workers with the Senate's approval of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). This trade agreement, which has garnered bipartisan support, will replace NAFTA and fulfill a promise made by the President. The USMCA, negotiated over a year ago, aims to rebalance trade between the three countries and is expected to drive economic growth and create jobs in the United States.
