President Joe Biden is announcing a framework for the Build Back Better Act, which aims to rebuild the middle class and make government work for working people. The framework will guide the drafting of legislative language and is expected to pass both houses of Congress. It will address climate change, create millions of jobs, improve the immigration system, and reduce the deficit. The framework includes a significant investment in children and caregiving, the largest effort to combat climate change in American history, and the biggest expansion of affordable healthcare in a decade. It also includes targeted investments to reduce costs for middle-class families and improve the immigration system. The plan is fully paid for by increasing taxes on large corporations and the wealthiest Americans.
