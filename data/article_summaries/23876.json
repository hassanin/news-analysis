The Obama Administration has announced three actions to boost the rural economy and promote job creation. The first action is to expand the government's purchase of biobased products, which will create jobs and drive innovation in rural areas. The second action is the Rural Jobs Accelerator, a national competition that will provide funding for projects that promote regional job creation. The third action is a partnership between the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor to train Health Information Technology professionals in rural areas. These actions build on the Administration's investments in rural America over the past three years. The Administration is committed to using every tool available to promote economic growth and create jobs in rural America.
