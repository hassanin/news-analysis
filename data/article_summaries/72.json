The Biden-Harris Administration has launched the Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation (FICOR) as part of the President's America the Beautiful Initiative. The FICOR includes leaders from the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, and Defense and aims to improve access to nature, expand outdoor recreation opportunities, and provide more affordable experiences on public lands and waters. The FICOR will coordinate policies, facilitate partnerships, and improve implementation on issues related to outdoor recreation. It was originally created in 2011 but was suspended by the previous administration. The Administration has also taken steps to expand access to the outdoors and protect natural resources, including launching recreation.gov, tracking outdoor recreation as an economic sector, and establishing the Every Kid Outdoors Pass.
