The National Climate Task Force recently held its fifth meeting to discuss President Biden's Build Back Better agenda and address the urgent need for action on climate change. The meeting was led by National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy and attended by Cabinet members and senior officials from 17 federal agencies. The Task Force focused on the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which emphasized the need for immediate action to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change. The report serves as a reminder that Americans are already experiencing the effects of climate change, such as wildfires, extreme heat, and drought. The meeting also touched on the progress of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal in the Senate and the Senate's steps towards passing the President's full Build Back Better agenda, which includes measures like an energy efficiency clean energy standard, tax cuts for clean electricity and electric vehicles, and the creation of a Civilian Climate Corps. The Task Force reaffirmed its commitment to implementing President Biden's vision of a whole-of-government approach to address climate change, as outlined in his January 27 Executive Order.
