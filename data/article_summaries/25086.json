President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of North Dakota and ordered Federal assistance to aid in the recovery efforts from severe storms and flooding that occurred from June 29 to July 1, 2020. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to state, tribal, and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding. James R. Stephenson has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for the recovery operations in the affected areas, and additional designations may be made in the future based on damage assessments.
