This article discusses a series of proclamations made by the President of the United States regarding the imposition of tariffs on steel imports. The Secretary of Commerce conducted an investigation into the impact of steel imports on national security and concluded that steel articles were being imported in quantities and under circumstances that threatened national security. The President concurred with this finding and imposed a 25% ad valorem tariff on steel articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. However, the President also allowed for discussions with countries that have a security relationship with the United States to find alternative ways to address the threat to national security. In subsequent proclamations, the President exempted steel articles imports from certain countries, including the member countries of the European Union (EU), from the tariff based on ongoing discussions and agreements reached. The article mentions that the United States and the EU agreed to expand coordination on trade remedies, customs matters, and addressing non-market excess capacity. They also agreed to negotiate global steel and aluminum arrangements. The President determined that these actions provide an effective means to address the threat to national security and decided to exclude specified volumes of steel articles imports from the EU from the tariff through December 31, 2023. The article further discusses ongoing discussions between the United States and the EU on global steel and aluminum arrangements and the renewal of exclusions granted for the import of steel products from the EU. The President also maintained the current tariff level for other countries and authorized necessary actions to ensure compliance with the requirements for in-quota treatment of steel imports from the EU. The modifications made by these proclamations are effective from January 1, 2024, unless expressly reduced, modified, or terminated.
