The President gave remarks on August 23, 2020, addressing various topics. He provided an update on the wildfires in California and the storms in the Gulf of Mexico, expressing condolences for those affected and assuring that the federal government is working closely with state and local representatives to provide assistance. He also announced a historic breakthrough in the fight against COVID-19, with the FDA issuing an emergency use authorization for a treatment called convalescent plasma. This treatment involves transfusing antibodies from recovered patients to help treat those currently infected. The President highlighted the success of this therapy and encouraged Americans who have recovered from the virus to donate plasma. He thanked the FDA, Dr. Hahn, and Secretary Azar for their work in making this breakthrough possible. The President also mentioned that other COVID-19 drugs in phase three of testing may be available to the public under the Right to Try program.
