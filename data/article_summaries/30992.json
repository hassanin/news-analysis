President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660 regarding Ukraine will continue beyond March 6, 2018. The actions and policies of individuals undermining democratic processes in Ukraine, as well as the actions of the Russian government, including the annexation of Crimea and the use of force in Ukraine, are seen as a threat to US national security and foreign policy. Therefore, Trump has determined that it is necessary to extend the national emergency.
