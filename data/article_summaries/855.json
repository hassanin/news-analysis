President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has issued an executive order to revoke Executive Order 13801, which was implemented on June 15, 2017, and focused on expanding apprenticeships in America. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, as well as the heads of executive departments and agencies, are instructed to consider rescinding any orders, rules, regulations, guidelines, or policies that were implemented or enforced under the revoked executive order. Any personnel positions, committees, task forces, or entities established as a result of the revoked executive order should also be abolished. The order specifies that it does not affect the authority granted by law to executive departments or agencies, nor does it impact the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It is to be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. The order does not create any rights or benefits that can be legally enforced against the United States or its departments, agencies, officers, employees, agents, or any other individuals.
