President Donald Trump issued a proclamation on National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, honoring those who defended the Korean Peninsula against the spread of Communism during the first major conflict of the Cold War. The Korean War, often referred to as the "Forgotten War," claimed the lives of over 36,000 Americans. The war began in 1950 when North Korean forces, backed by the Soviet Union, invaded South Korea. American troops arrived and pushed back the North Koreans, fighting alongside fifteen allies and partners for three years. An armistice was signed on July 27, 1953, halting the active fighting, but North Korea's ballistic and nuclear weapons programs still pose threats to the United States and its allies. Currently, over 28,000 American troops maintain a strong presence along the 38th parallel, which separates North and South Korea. President Trump calls upon all Americans to observe National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities to honor and thank the veterans.
