On October 14, 2019, President Biden declared a national emergency in response to the situation in Syria. The President cited the actions of the Government of Turkey in conducting a military offensive into northeast Syria, which undermines the campaign against ISIS, endangers civilians, and threatens peace and stability in the region. The national emergency, declared through Executive Order 13894, was set to expire on October 14, 2021. However, President Biden has decided to extend the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This decision was made to address the ongoing threat to national security and foreign policy posed by the situation in Syria. The notice of this extension will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
