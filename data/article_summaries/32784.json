On October 11, 2018, President Donald Trump signed the "Orrin G. Hatch-Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act" into law. This legislation aims to update copyright law to better address music licensing in the digital age and to provide fair compensation to artists and producers for their music used online. One provision of the law allows the board of directors of the designated mechanical licensing collective to adopt bylaws for selecting new directors, subject to the approval of the Register of Copyrights and the Librarian of Congress. The Librarian must approve each subsequent selection of a new director as the directors are considered inferior officers under the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. Another provision calls on the executive branch to give advance notice to Congress of any motion to lift a consent decree involving a performing rights society. The Trump Administration will strive to provide such notice, but it does not interpret the provision to require advance notice in cases where immediate action related to litigation is necessary.
