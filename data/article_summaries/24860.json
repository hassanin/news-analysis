In this article, President Barack Obama issues a memorandum regarding the continuation of certain authorities under the Trading With the Enemy Act with respect to Cuba. These authorities were previously set to terminate on September 14, 2010, but President Obama determines that their continuation for one year is in the national interest of the United States. As a result, he extends the exercise of those authorities until September 14, 2011, as implemented by the Cuban Assets Control Regulations. The Secretary of the Treasury is directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
