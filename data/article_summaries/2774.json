The Biden-Harris Administration is taking additional measures to protect communities from extreme heat, which is becoming more intense, frequent, and prolonged due to climate change. Heat waves have broken records across the country, causing significant impacts and costing billions of dollars. President Biden has allocated over $50 billion to help Americans become more resilient to climate impacts like heat waves. However, many Republicans in Congress deny climate change and oppose the President's climate protection bill. The new measures announced by the Administration include providing clear and accessible information to communities, lowering cooling costs, strengthening the power grid, and building a heat-ready workforce. These actions aim to enhance heat response and resilience nationwide.
