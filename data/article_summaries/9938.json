The Obama Administration announced changes to the U.S. Anti-Personnel Landmine Policy, bringing the country closer to the goal of eliminating anti-personnel landmines. The United States will align its policy with the Ottawa Convention, an international treaty that prohibits the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of anti-personnel landmines. The U.S. will not use landmines outside the Korean Peninsula, will not encourage others to engage in activities prohibited by the Ottawa Convention, and will destroy landmine stockpiles not required for the defense of South Korea. This change builds on previous steps taken to end the use of non-detectable and persistent mines. However, the unique circumstances on the Korean Peninsula prevent a change in policy there at this time. The United States is the largest financial supporter of humanitarian mine action and has provided over $2.3 billion in aid to over 90 countries for landmine clearance and other programs. This assistance has helped countries recover from conflict and return land and infrastructure to productive use.
