The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to advancing women's political and civic participation and leadership. They believe that the status of women is the status of democracy and that wherever women and girls are under threat, democracy, peace, and stability are also at risk. The administration is highlighting key actions and progress made during the Year of Action at the second Summit for Democracy. 

One of the initiatives is the Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal, which aims to increase women's and girls' civic and political leadership. The administration is also focused on advancing women's involvement in peace and security efforts, recognizing that their participation is essential for global security and democracy. 

The Global Partnership for Action on Gender-Based Online Harassment and Abuse is another important commitment. It brings together governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector to address the issue of technology-facilitated gender-based violence, which disproportionately affects women and LGBTQI+ political figures, leaders, journalists, and activists. The Biden-Harris Administration is announcing key actions and investments, including more than $13 million in targeted funding, to prevent and respond to this type of violence and support women leaders and democratic participation.
