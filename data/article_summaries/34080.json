The article discusses the life and legacy of Caesar Rodney, a Founding Father of the United States. Despite suffering from cancer and asthma, Rodney traveled 80 miles through a thunderstorm to cast Delaware's deciding vote for independence on July 2, 1776, ensuring the unanimous passing of the Declaration of Independence. Rodney also served under General George Washington during the Revolution and was honored for his service and devotion to the American cause. The article highlights the various ways Delaware and the federal government have honored Rodney's memory, including statues, stamps, coins, and the naming of schools and roads after him. However, the article also raises concerns that Rodney's legacy is at risk of being erased due to historical revisionism and attempts to reframe the nation's history. It mentions the removal of Rodney's equestrian statue from Rodney Square in Wilmington and advocates for the teaching of patriotic education and the creation of a national commission, called the "1776 Commission," to promote the truth about America's founding. The article concludes with a proclamation by President Donald J. Trump, declaring October 7, 2020, as the 292nd Anniversary of Caesar Rodney's birth and inviting people to observe the day in commemoration of Rodney's contributions to American independence and freedom.
