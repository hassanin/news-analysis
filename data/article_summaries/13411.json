The article discusses President Obama's efforts to prevent student loan interest rates from doubling. Last year, the President secured a one-year extension to keep the interest rate at 3.4 percent. However, without Congressional action, interest rates on new subsidized student loans will double to 6.8 percent on July 1 of this year. The President's FY 2014 Budget proposed a long-term solution that cuts rates on new loans, ensures affordable repayment options, and does not charge higher interest rates to pay for deficit reduction. The solution allows borrowers to benefit from low interest rates in the marketplace and guarantees these rates over the life of their loans. It also allows students to cap their payments at 10 percent of their income. Several proposals have been put forward in Congress to address the interest rate issue, but the House bill, H.R. 1911, would result in borrowers paying even more than if Congress does nothing at all. The President's plan is cost-neutral and ensures the stability of federal student loan programs. It also allows for investments in other higher education programs and efforts to make college more affordable for students and families.
