President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation declaring September 20, 2019, as National POW/MIA Recognition Day. This day is an opportunity for the nation to honor former American prisoners of war and to reaffirm the commitment to locate and bring home soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen, coast guardsmen, merchant marines, and civilians who remain missing in action. The proclamation also acknowledges the sacrifice and bravery of the 261 American service members who went missing in action during the D-Day invasion on June 6, 1944. The president calls upon the people of the United States, as well as federal, state, and local government officials and private organizations, to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
