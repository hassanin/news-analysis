Secretary Mnuchin and Secretary Pompeo held a press briefing to discuss President Trump's new executive order on combating global terrorism. The executive order, titled "Modernizing Sanctions to Combat Terrorism," enhances the U.S. government's ability to identify, sanction, and deter perpetrators of terrorism worldwide. The order allows for better targeting of terrorist group leaders, provides new tools to pursue individuals involved in terrorist training, authorizes secondary sanctions on foreign financial institutions involved in significant financial transactions with sanctioned persons, and targets actors on behalf of designated global terrorists. As a result of the executive order, the Treasury sanctioned over two dozen individuals and entities from 11 terrorist groups, including Iran's Qods Forces, Hamas, ISIS, al Qaeda, and their affiliates.

Secretary Pompeo also addressed the resignation of National Security Advisor John Bolton, stating that President Trump asked for Bolton's resignation and that it was received that morning. Pompeo emphasized that the President is entitled to have staff members he trusts and values, and that the President's foreign policy will not change in a material way due to Bolton's departure. Secretary Mnuchin echoed this sentiment and stated that the President's view of the Iraq War differed from Bolton's.

Regarding Venezuela, Secretary Mnuchin noted that the Treasury Department and the State Department have been actively involved in imposing sanctions, and expressed concern about the humanitarian crisis in the country. The secretaries also discussed U.S. efforts to address migration from Mexico and the progress made in deterring migration.

When asked about the recent reports of the CIA pulling a top Russian asset out of concern for their safety, Secretary Pompeo stated that the reporting was inaccurate and that he would not comment further on the matter.
