The Small Business Administration (SBA) has announced that it will be expanding eligibility for loans for small businesses. This change will allow approximately 70,000 additional small businesses, including auto dealers, RV dealerships, and auto industry suppliers, to access SBA programs. The SBA is implementing an alternate size standard for its 7(a) loan program, which will allow small businesses with up to $8.5 million of net worth and an average of $3 million of net income over the last two years to qualify for SBA loans. This change is part of the SBA's efforts to expand access to capital for small businesses during the economic downturn. The SBA expects that this expansion will not exceed the program limitations of $17.5 billion in the 7(a) program and $7.5 billion in the 504 program. The SBA's goal is to provide expanded access to capital for America's small businesses and this change complements the provisions of the Recovery Act.
