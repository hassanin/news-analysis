President Obama has declared a major disaster in Kentucky and ordered federal aid to help with recovery efforts following severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides that occurred from August 18-23, 2014. The federal funding will be available to the commonwealth and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work, facility repairs or replacements, and hazard mitigation measures. W. Michael Moore has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
