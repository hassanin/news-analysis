President Obama has declared a major disaster in the District of Columbia and ordered federal aid to assist with the recovery efforts from Hurricane Sandy. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to the District of Columbia and certain non-profit organizations for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures are also eligible for federal funding. Jack Schuback has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
