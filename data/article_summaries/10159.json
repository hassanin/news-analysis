The article discusses the settlement of the Cobell class-action lawsuit on Indian Trust Management. The lawsuit, which was originally filed in 1996, challenged the United States government's trust management and accounting of American Indian trust accounts. The settlement is seen as an important step towards reconciling the trust beneficiaries and the federal government and improving the management of Indian trust assets in the future. The President applauds the efforts of Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Attorney General Eric Holder in reaching this settlement. However, it is noted that the settlement still needs to be endorsed by the District Court for the District of Columbia and requires legislation from Congress for implementation. The President urges Congress to act swiftly in correcting this long-standing injustice.
