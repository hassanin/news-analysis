Jennifer Klein, the White House Gender Policy Council Director, and Julie Chavez Rodriguez, the White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director, recently hosted a meeting with state legislative leaders from Kansas, Louisiana, and North Carolina. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the ongoing attacks on reproductive rights in these states and the efforts being made to protect access to reproductive health care. In Kansas, there will be a ballot measure on August 2, 2022, that could potentially remove the right to abortion from the state constitution. The Kansas Supreme Court has previously ruled twice that the state constitution guarantees the right to abortion. In Louisiana, the legislature is about to adjourn and there are multiple bills circulating that could undermine women's rights. In North Carolina, ongoing work is needed to safeguard access to care. The White House officials expressed gratitude to the participants for their leadership and dedication to defending reproductive freedom.
