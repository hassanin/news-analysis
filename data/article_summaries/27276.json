President Trump has announced a new initiative to combat the opioid crisis in the United States. The initiative aims to address the misuse of prescription opioids, the supply of illicit drugs, and the lack of access to evidence-based addiction treatment. The government-funding bill signed by President Trump doubles the amount of funding provided by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services to each state for opioid addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery support. The initiative sets a goal of reducing opioid prescriptions by one-third within three years. The plan also emphasizes the need to remove the stigma surrounding addiction and approach it as a public health challenge. The U.S. Surgeon General, Jerome Adams, believes that defeating the crisis will require the collaboration of government, doctors, businesses, faith-based and community partners, schools, and all sectors of civil society.
