On November 27, 2013, President Obama pardoned the National Thanksgiving Turkey in a ceremony at the White House. The turkeys, named Popcorn and Caramel, were 20-week old, 38-pound turkeys raised in Roseau County, Minnesota. The public voted on social media to decide which turkey would become the 2013 National Thanksgiving Turkey. The turkeys were raised by John Burkel and his family, with students from Badger High School also attending the ceremony. After the pardoning, the turkeys were taken to George Washington's Mount Vernon Estate and Gardens for display during the Christmas season. They were then sent to Morven Park's Turkey Hill in Leesburg, Virginia for their permanent home. Additionally, Jaindl's Turkey Farm in Pennsylvania gave President Obama's family two dressed turkeys to donate to a local food bank.
