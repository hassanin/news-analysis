President Donald J. Trump has sent a letter to all Members of Congress, emphasizing the need to secure the borders. The letter includes a presentation by Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, which was supposed to be delivered during a meeting with Congressional leadership. However, some attendees did not want to hear the presentation at the time, so the President decided to make it available to all Members of Congress. The letter highlights the importance of controlling borders and the consequences of failing to do so, such as compromising the safety, security, and well-being of citizens. The President urges lawmakers to base decisions on facts and the input of law enforcement personnel. The presentation attached to the letter makes the case for increased funding, resources, and authorities to address the border security crisis. It argues that illegal immigration is unfair, unjust, uncompassionate, and cruel, with negative impacts on individuals and communities. The letter stresses the necessity of a physical barrier, citing the support of members from both parties in the past. It also calls for closing loopholes in federal law that incentivize illegal entry and smuggling, particularly of minors. The President concludes the letter by urging both parties to prioritize the national interest and work together to secure the border and establish a lawful and safe immigration system.
