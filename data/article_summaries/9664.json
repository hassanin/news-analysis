President Obama released a statement expressing his satisfaction with the release of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He highlighted that the bill is estimated to reduce the deficit by $127 billion over the next ten years and up to $650 billion in the following decade, while extending coverage to 31 million more Americans. The President emphasized that the goal of the legislation is to provide stability and security to those with insurance, as well as affordable coverage to those without. He commended the bipartisan effort and support from leading health economists, who praised key provisions in the bill that aim to reduce long-term deficits, improve care quality, and establish fiscal stability. President Obama stressed that the challenges facing the healthcare system are not new, but failing to act will lead to higher premiums, escalating costs, and more instability for those with coverage. He expressed his eagerness to collaborate with the Senate and House to pass a finalized bill as soon as possible.
