President Biden held a press conference in the Oval Office to announce the extension of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The PPP is aimed at providing financial assistance to small businesses that have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The President emphasized the importance of supporting small businesses, particularly those owned by minority groups, as they are crucial to the economy. He thanked bipartisan senators and representatives for their efforts in passing the extension. The President also highlighted the success of the program, with over three million small businesses receiving forgivable loans, and emphasized the need to continue providing support to ensure the survival of these businesses and the preservation of jobs.
