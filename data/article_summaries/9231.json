In this article, White House Press Secretary Olivia Dalton provides an overview of President Biden's economic plan, known as Bidenomics. The plan focuses on growing the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, rather than relying on trickle-down economics. Dalton highlights three key pillars of Bidenomics: making smart investments in America, educating and empowering workers, and promoting competition to lower costs and support small businesses. She also mentions that Bidenomics has led to strong economic growth, job creation, and low inflation. Dalton further discusses the President's visit to Chicago, where he will speak to business and labor leaders about the importance of building an economy that benefits everyone. The article also includes questions and answers on topics such as Russia, inflation, air travel delays, and abortion rights.
