The United States and Japan have announced a total of up to $4.5 billion in pledges to the Green Climate Fund (GCF). This includes up to $3 billion from the United States and up to $1.5 billion from Japan. These pledges aim to support efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions and build climate resilience worldwide. The pledges will be reiterated at the GCF's pledging session on November 20 in Berlin, Germany, where additional countries are expected to announce pledges. The GCF will mobilize investment from the private sector to meet the climate challenge. The United States and Japan have a history of collective leadership in supporting resilient and low-carbon development. They encourage all countries to join them in pledging to the GCF and will work with partners to ensure its effectiveness.
