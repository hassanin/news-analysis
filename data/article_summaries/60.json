President Biden and his national security team recently met with the President's Intelligence Advisory Board (PIAB) to express gratitude for their service and discuss the board's evaluation of the U.S. Intelligence Community's efforts to protect the nation. The president appreciated the board's work in ensuring the effectiveness and compliance of the intelligence community's authorities and activities, including their study on the value of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The board unanimously found that the failure to reauthorize Section 702 could be a significant intelligence failure. The president also discussed the intelligence community's role in combating the threat of illicit fentanyl and emphasized the importance of robust oversight of intelligence activities, commending the Intelligence Oversight Board for their ongoing work in this area.
