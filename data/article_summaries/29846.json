Senator Richard Lugar, one of Indiana's greatest statesmen, has passed away. He made countless contributions to the nation, including his work in ending apartheid in South Africa and enforcing treaties that dismantled Soviet weapons of mass destruction. As the longest-serving member of Congress from Indiana and a Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient, Senator Lugar leaves behind a legacy of public service that will inspire future generations. He was also a friend and mentor to many, and his kindness, example, and wisdom will be greatly missed. Indiana and America will never forget his leadership and service. Condolences are extended to his wife Char, the entire Lugar family, and all those who remember and appreciate his remarkable public service.
