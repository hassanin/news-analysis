President Obama marked the 100th day of the Recovery Act by releasing the "100 Days, 100 Projects" report, which highlights the progress made in the first 100 days of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The report includes over $467 million in Recovery Act investment in geothermal and solar technology. The President announced these investments during a visit to Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, Nevada. The funds are expected to create thousands of jobs and bring renewable energy technology to the mass market. The Recovery Act is also providing financial relief, creating and saving jobs, and spurring technology and infrastructure investments across the country. Over $112 billion in Recovery Act funds has been obligated, and over 150,000 jobs have been created or saved. The Act also includes measures such as tax credits and investments in high-speed rail, broadband access, and a modern health information technology system.
