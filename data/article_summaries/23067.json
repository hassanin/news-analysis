The United States and Indonesia have announced that all fresh highly enriched uranium (HEU) in Indonesia has been downblended to low enriched uranium (LEU). They plan to eliminate all remaining HEU in Indonesia by September 2016. This achievement is significant because it means that all of Southeast Asia will be free of HEU. Indonesia produces the medical isotope molybdenum-99 (Mo-99), and they stopped using HEU to produce it in 2010. They plan to restart production using LEU in 2016.
