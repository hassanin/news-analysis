President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has issued an executive order declaring a national emergency in response to the situation in Burma. The order states that the military coup in Burma, which overthrew the democratically elected civilian government and led to the arrest and detention of government leaders, politicians, human rights defenders, journalists, and religious leaders, poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. As a result, the order blocks the property and interests in property of foreign persons determined to be operating in the defense sector or any other sector of the Burmese economy, as well as those responsible for undermining democratic processes, threatening peace and security, restricting freedom of expression, or engaging in human rights abuses in Burma. The order also suspends the entry of noncitizens determined to meet certain criteria, unless their entry is deemed not contrary to the interests of the United States. Additionally, the order prohibits transactions that evade or violate the prohibitions set forth in the order, and it prohibits the making of certain donations to blocked persons. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to take necessary actions to carry out the purposes of the order. The order does not affect any action taken pursuant to a previous executive order, and the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to submit reports to Congress on the national emergency declared in this order. The order also clarifies that it does not impair the authority granted by law to executive departments or agencies, and it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
