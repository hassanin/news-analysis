The United States officially recognizes Juan Guaido, the President of the Venezuelan National Assembly, as the Interim President of Venezuela. The National Assembly, the only legitimate branch of government elected by the Venezuelan people, declared Nicolas Maduro illegitimate and the presidency vacant. The people of Venezuela have spoken out against Maduro and demanded freedom and the rule of law. The United States will use its economic and diplomatic power to press for the restoration of Venezuelan democracy. They encourage other Western Hemisphere governments to recognize Guaido as the Interim President and will work with them to support his efforts. The Maduro regime is held directly responsible for any threats to the safety of the Venezuelan people. Guaido emphasizes the need to remain united and firm for a democratic and free Venezuela, as violence is the usurper's weapon.
