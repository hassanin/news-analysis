The National Security Council is hosting an international counter-ransomware event with over 30 partners to improve network resilience, address the financial systems that make ransomware profitable, collaborate with law enforcement to disrupt the ransomware ecosystem, and use diplomacy to address safe harbors and improve partner capacity. Ransomware attacks have affected various organizations worldwide, causing significant economic losses. The Biden Administration is taking action to counter the threat, but they also call on the private sector to strengthen their cyber defenses. The Administration is leading international efforts to combat ransomware, as transnational criminal organizations are often behind these attacks. The counter-ransomware efforts are focused on disrupting ransomware infrastructure and actors, enhancing resilience against ransomware, combating virtual currency misuse in ransom payments, and bolstering international cooperation.
