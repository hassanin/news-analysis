Tonight, Jewish communities worldwide will celebrate Passover, a holiday that commemorates the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. This year, it holds special significance as it will be the first time in three years that families and friends can gather around the Seder table due to the progress made in combating the pandemic. Passover has always been a symbol of freedom, redemption, faith, and hope for Jewish communities, who have endured persecution and oppression throughout history. It has also inspired oppressed peoples everywhere, giving them a sense of promise and the belief that their liberation is possible. This year, the holiday holds a special place in our hearts as we think of the people of Ukraine and others around the world who are standing up against tyranny. Passover reminds us that with faith, even the most challenging obstacles can be overcome, and hope continues to guide us towards a better future. Jill and I extend our wishes for a Happy Passover to all those celebrating. Chag Sameach!
