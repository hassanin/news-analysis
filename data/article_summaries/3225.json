The Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized delivering equitable relief to hard-hit small businesses since taking office. They have focused on providing support to mom and pop businesses, women-owned businesses, and entrepreneurs of color who were previously excluded from relief efforts under the previous administration. The administration made policy changes to target the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to the smallest businesses and those in underserved communities. These reforms resulted in a higher share of loans going to small businesses in underserved communities, including communities of color. Overall, the administration has distributed more than $450 billion in relief to over 6 million small businesses through the Small Business Administration, including PPP loans.
