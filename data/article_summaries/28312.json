The National Security Strategy (NSS) published by the U.S. government is a document that outlines President Donald J. Trump's vision for national security and how it will be implemented. The NSS emphasizes the belief that America's government should prioritize the needs and safety of its citizens, and that this focus on America's interests is crucial for effective leadership in the world. The strategy is based on four pillars, which are guided by a return to principled realism. The NSS recognizes the importance of power in global affairs and affirms the role of sovereign states in maintaining peace. It also emphasizes the promotion of American values as a means to spread peace and prosperity globally. President Trump's ultimate goal is to leave a stronger, better, freer, prouder, and greater nation for future generations.
