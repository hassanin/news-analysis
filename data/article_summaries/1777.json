Deputy National Security Advisory for Cyber and Emerging Technologies, Anne Neuberger, recently traveled to Brussels, Belgium to participate in a special cyber session of the NATO North Atlantic Council. This session included National Cyber Coordinators and NATO National Permanent Representatives for the first time. Neuberger emphasized the need for Allies to collaborate and enhance their efforts in deterring, detecting, and responding to cyber threats, as they will continue to be a crucial aspect of geopolitics and conflict in the 21st century. She specifically called for tighter coordination in responding to disruptive and destructive cyber activity against allies and stressed the importance of modernizing both NATO and national cyber defenses to strengthen collective cybersecurity resilience. Neuberger also held bilateral meetings with senior European Union officials, highlighting the commitment of the Biden-Harris Administration to NATO, partnership with the EU, and international cooperation in cybersecurity and secure digital innovation.
