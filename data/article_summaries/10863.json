The United States and Brazil have a strong trade and economic relationship. Brazil is the eighth largest trading partner of the US, with US goods and services exports to Brazil totaling $63 billion in 2011 and supporting around 300,000 US jobs. The trade between the two countries has nearly tripled in the past decade to over $100 billion in 2011. Brazil's demand for imports has also increased significantly, with goods imports tripling from $47.2 billion in 2002 to $226.2 billion in 2011. The largest US goods export category to Brazil in 2011 was machinery, valued at $7.9 billion. Both goods and services exports to Brazil benefit businesses across all 50 states in the US. In addition to trade, there is also significant bilateral investment between the two countries. Brazilian firms invested nearly $3.7 billion in the US in 2011, with top sectors for investment including energy, manufacturing, and construction materials. This investment supports job creation and contributes to US goods exports. Some recent examples of Brazilian investment in the US include plans to expand plastics production, open a new facility in Texas, and invest in metal manufacturing capacity. The US is also working to facilitate more job-supporting exports to Brazil, with success stories including a fire truck manufacturer winning a contract to supply fire engines, a shipbuilding company winning a contract to build vessels, and a manufacturer and repair service company entering into an agreement with a Brazilian firm. Overall, the US and Brazil have a strong economic relationship that contributes to jobs and growth in both countries.
