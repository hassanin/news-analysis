President Obama, Vice President Biden, and Transportation Secretary LaHood announced the approval of the 2,000th transportation project under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The President highlighted that these projects are being approved ahead of schedule and under budget. The 2,000th project is a $68 million project in Kalamazoo County, Michigan, involving the widening of I-94 to improve safety and ease congestion. State departments of transportation have reported intense competition among contractors for ARRA projects, resulting in bids that are 15-30% lower than expected. The ARRA provides $48.1 billion for transportation infrastructure projects, including highways, bridges, transit, high-speed rail, airports, and shipyards. The Transportation Investments Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) team was established to ensure rapid availability of funds for transportation projects. Lower-than-expected bids are allowing states to stretch economic recovery funds and undertake additional projects. Examples of projects with substantially lower bids include a reconstruction project at Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport, a drainage project in Carroll County, and a project on the Merritt Parkway in Connecticut. Other states, such as Pennsylvania, Utah, and Louisiana, have also seen lower bids for their projects.
