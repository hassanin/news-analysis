First Lady Michelle Obama dedicated the White House Kitchen Garden and announced updates to make it more accessible. The updates include a revised layout, an entryway with an arbor, a wider walkway, and a gathering area with a table and benches. The garden has been supported by the Burpee Foundation and the W. Atlee Burpee Company, and the National Park Foundation will help preserve it. The garden was planted in 2009 and has supplied fruits and vegetables to the First Family, guests at White House events, and those in need in the local community. Students from across the country have been invited to help in planting and harvesting the garden. The updates were made through a cooperative agreement between the National Park Service and the University of Virginia School of Architecture. The wood used for the structures has historical significance, including wood from Thomas Jefferson's Monticello and Martin Luther King Jr.'s home.
