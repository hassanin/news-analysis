In this message from the President, it is stated that the Clean Diamond Trade Act authorizes the President to prohibit the importation or exportation of rough diamonds that have not been controlled through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. The Act takes effect when the President certifies to Congress that an applicable waiver granted by the World Trade Organization (WTO) is in effect or when an applicable decision in a resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council is in effect. The President certified that a waiver granted by the WTO has been in effect since January 1, 2003, and will remain in effect through December 31, 2012.
