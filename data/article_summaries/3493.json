Drug overdose deaths in the US have reached a historic high, with over 104,000 Americans dying due to drug overdoses in the 12-month period ending in September 2021. President Biden has outlined the actions his administration is taking to address addiction and the overdose epidemic. The comprehensive approach includes increasing funding for public health and supply reduction, removing barriers to treatment, reducing harm and saving lives, and stopping the trafficking of illicit drugs. The President's FY2022 budget request includes a historic $41 billion for drug policy efforts. The administration aims to achieve universal access to medication for opioid use disorder by 2025 and has taken steps to remove unnecessary barriers to treatment. Harm reduction services, such as naloxone, fentanyl test strips, and syringe service programs, are now a federal drug policy priority. The administration also recognizes the impact of transnational organized crime on drug trafficking and aims to address the core causes and sources of criminal activities. These actions build upon previous efforts and the resources provided by the American Rescue Plan.
