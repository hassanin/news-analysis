Major companies, non-profits, and government agencies have responded to the Biden-Harris Administration's Call to Action to raise awareness about emergency rental assistance. The aim is to ensure that tenants and landlords take advantage of federal rental assistance to cover rent, utilities, and other housing costs, and to prevent evictions. The combined commitments made could potentially reach tens of millions of Americans. As part of this effort, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has launched a rental assistance finder tool on ConsumerFinance.gov/RentHelp. This tool allows individuals to find local rental assistance programs in their area and apply for assistance. The American Rescue Plan has made billions of dollars in federal rental assistance available to renters and struggling landlords. Emergency rental assistance is available in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., territories, and Tribal areas, even after the CDC eviction moratorium expires on August 1, 2021. The Biden-Harris Administration has engaged various stakeholders to spread awareness of the CFPB's tool and the available resources. Agencies, non-profit groups, faith-based organizations, and private sector companies are all responding to the call to action. The efforts to raise awareness are expected to reach tens of millions of Americans. The Call to Action remains open for other entities to join in spreading the word.
