Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Richard Cordray, and Domestic Policy Council Director Cecilia Mu√±oz met with presidents and leaders from ten colleges and universities who committed to providing key financial information to incoming students. The commitment includes providing information on the cost of college, financial aid options, net costs after grants and scholarships, estimated monthly loan payments after graduation, and information about student outcomes. The colleges and universities making this commitment are Arizona State University, Miami Dade College, North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University, State University System of New York, Syracuse University, University of Massachusetts System, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University System of Maryland, University of Texas System, and Vassar College. The goal is to improve transparency and help students and families make informed decisions about their higher education investment. The U.S. Department of Education and CFPB have also developed a model financial aid award letter, or Financial Aid Shopping Sheet, to provide prospective students with clear information about their financial aid options. President Obama encourages all colleges to adopt this shopping sheet to promote greater transparency in financial aid.
