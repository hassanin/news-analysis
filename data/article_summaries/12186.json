The Obama Administration has launched an online Veterans Employment Center, which is a one-stop-shop that connects veterans, transitioning service members, and their spouses to employers. This integrated employment tool aims to help veterans and service members translate their military skills into the civilian workforce. The Veterans Employment Center provides a comprehensive database of resumes for employers to find and hire veterans, service members, and their spouses. The tool also includes features such as a resume-builder, military skills translator, and detailed career and training resources. The Department of Veterans Affairs collaborated with other government departments, including Defense, Labor, Education, and the Office of Personnel Management, to develop this online resource. Employers will be able to search and view veteran, service member, and spouse resumes in one location. The Veterans Employment Center is part of the Joining Forces initiative launched by First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden to support service members and their families.
