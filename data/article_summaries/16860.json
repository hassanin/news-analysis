President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation to establish the Castle Mountains National Monument in the Mojave Desert. The area, located near the Mojave National Preserve, is rich in natural, cultural, and historical resources. It connects water flow and wildlife corridors within the Preserve and completes the boundary of the Preserve along the California-Nevada border. The Castle Mountains rise over 5,000 feet and offer picturesque views of the surrounding landscape. The area is home to diverse plant and animal species, including a herd of desert bighorn sheep and numerous bat species. The Castle Mountains area also contains significant cultural resources, such as prehistoric rock art and historic sites related to Native American tribes, mining, and ranching. The establishment of the monument will protect these resources and ensure their preservation for future generations. The management of the monument will be carried out by the National Park Service, with a management plan to be developed within three years.
