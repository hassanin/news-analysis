President Obama met with Senator Robert Menendez and Representatives Nydia Velazquez and Luis Gutierrez to discuss comprehensive immigration reform. The President expressed his commitment to working in a bipartisan manner to pass this reform, which would include resources for border security and accountability for both undocumented individuals and unscrupulous employers. The President also expressed his support for the DREAM Act, a bipartisan bill that he cosponsored when he was a senator, and discussed a comprehensive immigration reform bill that Senator Menendez plans to introduce in the coming weeks. The President highlighted that the strength of the proposal is that it is based on a bipartisan framework developed by Senators Schumer and Graham.
