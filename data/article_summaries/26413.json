On April 3, 2014, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in response to the situation in and in relation to South Sudan. This was done to address the threat posed by activities such as violence, atrocities, human rights abuses, recruitment of child soldiers, attacks on peacekeepers, and obstruction of humanitarian operations. The national emergency, declared under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, was set to expire on April 3, 2020. However, due to the ongoing threat to national security and foreign policy, President Trump has decided to extend the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This decision has been published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
