President Donald Trump has signed the "Abolish Human Trafficking Act of 2017" into law. This law aims to enhance the US government's efforts to combat human trafficking. However, there is a constitutional concern with one provision of the Act, specifically Section 5. This section requires the Department of Homeland Security to take measures to avoid arresting, charging, or prosecuting human trafficking victims for offenses that directly result from their victimization. The Trump administration will interpret this provision in line with the executive branch's prosecutorial discretion and the President's constitutional responsibility to faithfully execute the laws of the United States.
