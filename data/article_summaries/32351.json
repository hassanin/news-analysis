The GOP tax reform bills aim to address corporate tax gaming and make it more difficult for corporations to avoid paying taxes. The proposed reforms include cutting the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, implementing a territorial system that exempts most foreign income from taxation, imposing a 10% rate on intangible property held overseas by US multinationals, and preventing foreign multinationals from abusing transfer pricing. Additionally, the bills include measures to prevent companies from loading up on debt in the US to capitalize foreign companies. The editorial argues that these reforms are a serious attempt to fix a broken US tax code and would benefit the economy.
