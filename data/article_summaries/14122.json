The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, also known as the Recovery Act, made the largest single investment in clean energy in history, providing over $90 billion in strategic clean energy investments and tax incentives. This funding supported job creation, the deployment of low-carbon technologies, and the promotion of energy efficiency. The investments helped transform America's clean energy economy by creating jobs, scaling up renewable energy generation, reducing costs for clean energy technologies, driving innovation, improving energy efficiency, promoting grid modernization, increasing advanced vehicle and fuels technologies, and investing in carbon capture and sequestration. These investments have had a significant impact on reducing fossil fuel consumption and carbon pollution, while also stimulating economic growth.
