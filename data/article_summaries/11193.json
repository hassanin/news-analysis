Vice President Biden announced that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is making nearly $100 million in Recovery Act funding available to help eliminate dangerous lead-based paint and other health and safety hazards from low-income homes. The grants will be distributed to 53 local programs in 20 states and the District of Columbia to protect young children from lead poisoning and create jobs. The funding will contribute to President Obama's mission under the Recovery Act to create and sustain jobs and jumpstart the nation's economy. The grants were initially qualified applicants in the FY08 funding cycle but were not awarded grants at that time due to limited funds. The Recovery Act includes $13.61 billion for projects and programs administered by HUD, with nearly 75% allocated to state and local recipients. The remaining 25% of funds will be awarded through a competitive grant process in the coming months. HUD is committed to implementing Recovery Act investments swiftly and transparently.
