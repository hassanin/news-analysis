She also mentioned the previous work done through the American Rescue Plan, which expanded the Child Tax Credit and invested $39 billion in childcare for families and providers. The Vice President acknowledged the importance of supporting caregivers of seniors and people with disabilities as well. Following her remarks, Harris was asked about the situation in Afghanistan, to which she responded that she would continue to receive briefings and provide updates.
