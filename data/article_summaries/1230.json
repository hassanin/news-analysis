The article discusses the record-breaking voter turnout in the 2020 elections and highlights the power of the vote, particularly in Georgia during the November election and the subsequent Senate runoff in January. It mentions that numerous recounts and court cases confirmed the integrity of the democratic process. However, instead of celebrating the right to vote and focusing on campaign merits, Republicans in Georgia passed a new law that restricts voting rights. The article argues that this law, along with similar ones pursued by Republicans in other states, is an attack on the Constitution and a violation of good conscience. It specifically criticizes provisions in the law that end voting hours early, impose strict restrictions on absentee ballots, and criminalize providing water to voters waiting in line. The article describes these actions as a modern-day version of Jim Crow laws and calls for the passage of the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to protect voting rights. It concludes by urging Republicans, including those who supported a broad coalition of voters in the last election, to prioritize the best ideas and allow people to vote freely.
