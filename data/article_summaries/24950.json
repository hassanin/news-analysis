President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of New York and has ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The declaration was made in response to a severe winter storm and snowstorm that occurred in February 2013. Federal funding will be available to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. In addition, funding will be provided for snow assistance and hazard mitigation measures. Michael F. Byrne has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and further designations may be made if requested by the state and warranted by damage assessments.
