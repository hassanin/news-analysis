This article is about the executive orders issued by President Donald Trump on February 28, 2017, regarding education and historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). The orders aim to advance opportunities in higher education and recognize the contributions of HBCUs to the country. The White House Initiative on HBCUs is established to work with various partners to improve the capacity of HBCUs to provide high-quality education. The initiative has two primary missions: increasing the private-sector role in strengthening HBCUs and enhancing their capabilities to serve young adults. Federal agencies are required to prepare annual plans to strengthen the participation of HBCUs in federal programs and initiatives. The President's Board of Advisors on HBCUs is also established to advise the President on matters related to strengthening the educational capacity of HBCUs. Executive Order 13532, which promoted excellence, innovation, and sustainability at HBCUs, is revoked. The order applies to executive departments and agencies designated by the Secretary of Education, and they are required to provide necessary information and assistance to the Board. The order is implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
