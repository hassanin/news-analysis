On July 29, 2020, President Donald Trump issued a statement declaring the continuation of a national emergency with respect to Lebanon. The national emergency was initially declared on August 1, 2007, in response to the actions of certain individuals undermining Lebanon's legitimate and democratically elected government, contributing to the breakdown of the rule of law, and interfering with Lebanese sovereignty. The ongoing activities, such as Iran's arms transfers to Hezbollah, were cited as a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency and the measures adopted to address the situation will remain in effect beyond August 1, 2020, for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
