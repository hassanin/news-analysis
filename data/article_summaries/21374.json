President Obama has announced measures to strengthen American manufacturing, including a competition for a new textiles-focused manufacturing innovation institute and funding to support small manufacturers. The President is investing nearly $500 million in public-private partnerships to invest in cutting-edge technologies and strengthen small manufacturers. The Department of Defense is launching a competition for a new manufacturing hub focused on textiles technologies, with a $75 million federal investment matched by private sector resources. The President is also launching a Supply Chain Innovation Initiative to build public-private partnerships and strengthen small U.S. manufacturers. In addition, the President's Fiscal Year 2016 Budget provides resources to double the number of manufacturing innovation institutes to 16 by the end of 2016 and build a network of up to 45 institutes over the decade. The President is calling on Congress to make bipartisan investments to strengthen manufacturing across the United States.
