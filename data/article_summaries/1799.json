President Biden delivered remarks in the State Dining Room, where he signed a bill aimed at reforming the U.S. Postal Service. The bill repeals the pre-funding mandate, guarantees mail delivery six days a week, and increases transparency by requiring the Postal Service to develop an online public dashboard with service performance data. The bill also streamlines healthcare for postal workers and allows the Postal Service to partner with state, local, and tribal governments to offer non-postal services to the public. President Biden emphasized the importance of the Postal Service in delivering democracy and acknowledged the dedicated men and women of the Postal Service who have continued to deliver throughout the pandemic. He also mentioned the Postal Service's role in delivering prescriptions, COVID-19 test kits, and mail-in ballots. The President recognized the need for further improvements, such as modernizing and electrifying the Postal Service's vehicle fleet.
