The Biden-Harris Administration has made significant progress in managing COVID-19 over the past two years. As the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE) comes to an end on May 11, 2023, the administration has taken steps to ensure continued access to vaccines, treatments, and tests, and to prepare for future risks. During the PHE, the administration focused on implementing a large-scale adult vaccination program, as well as making testing and treatments widely available. After the PHE ends, access to vaccines and certain treatments will generally not be affected. The US government has also been a major donor of vaccines to other countries, sharing nearly 700 million doses with 117 countries. The availability of vaccinations, tests, and treatments has positioned both the nation and the world well as they transition out of the emergency phase of the COVID-19 response. The administration has also implemented policies and programs that will remain in place beyond the PHE.
