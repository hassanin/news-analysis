On June 30, 2009, the White House released a statement by the President regarding a meeting held to discuss the 1976 H1N1 flu outbreak. The President, along with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Education Secretary Arne Duncan, Homeland Security Advisor John Brennan, and other senior advisors, met with a group of individuals who had knowledge about the lessons learned from the 1976 influenza outbreak.
