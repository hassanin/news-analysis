Today, the major reforms of the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act take effect. These reforms aim to shift the balance of power back to consumers and hold credit card companies accountable for deceptive practices. The new rules prohibit retroactive rate increases, misleading late fees, and over-limit fee traps. Credit card companies are now required to provide ample notification of any changes to card terms and use clear payment dates and times. The reforms also include protections for underage consumers, restrictions on double billing, and caps on high-fee cards. These measures are part of the administration's ongoing efforts to strengthen consumer protections and enact financial reform. However, consumers are still responsible for paying their bills, but these rules provide them with the necessary information to make responsible financial decisions.
