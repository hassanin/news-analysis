The Biden Administration is emphasizing the importance of improving indoor air quality in managing COVID-19 this fall and winter. As people spend more time indoors, the spread of contagious viruses like COVID-19 becomes easier. The Administration has called on business and school leaders to take steps to enhance indoor air quality as a way to mitigate the spread of the virus. A Summit on Improving Indoor Air Quality was recently hosted by the White House, bringing together experts, leaders, and stakeholders to highlight the benefits of improved indoor air quality in combating COVID-19. The Administration is encouraging businesses and organizations to participate in the Clean Air in Buildings Challenge, which provides recommendations for improving indoor air quality. A new website has been launched where businesses can learn more about the challenge and pledge their commitment to improving indoor air quality. Schools are also being supported in improving indoor air quality, with many planning to use American Rescue Plan funds for this purpose. The Administration is collaborating with organizations to provide guidance and technical support for making improvements. Efforts are being made to recognize organizations that are leading the way in indoor air quality improvements, with the Environmental Protection Agency soliciting feedback and the Department of Energy preparing to announce criteria for recognizing schools that are making improvements.
