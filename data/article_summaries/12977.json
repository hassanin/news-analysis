The White House has released a report from the National Economic Council highlighting the importance of confirming a director for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The report emphasizes that without a director, the CFPB will not be able to fully exercise its authorities to protect and educate American consumers. The President had signed the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act into law, which created the CFPB as a watchdog for consumers. Richard Cordray has been nominated to lead the CFPB and has bipartisan support, but some Senate Republicans are opposing his nomination. The report argues that this opposition puts consumers at risk and urges Senate Republicans to confirm Cordray.
