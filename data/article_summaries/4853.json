In a press briefing, President Biden discussed the latest job numbers, stating that the economy created 235,000 new jobs in August and the unemployment rate fell to 5.2%, the lowest in 18 months. He emphasized that the Biden plan is working and that the economy is on the move again. He highlighted that job creation under his administration has been nearly double that of any prior first-year President. Despite the impact of the Delta variant, the economy is showing durable and strong recovery. However, he acknowledged that there is more work to be done.

The President also outlined two critical tasks ahead. The first is to make more progress in fighting the Delta variant of COVID-19. He mentioned that the steps taken so far, including vaccination efforts, have made the economy capable of growing and adding jobs even in the face of the Delta surge. The second task is for Congress to pass his economic agenda, including the bipartisan infrastructure plan and the Build Back Better agenda. He emphasized the importance of investing in America's future, creating good-paying jobs, reducing price pressures, and helping families with childcare and eldercare.

President Biden also discussed the need for a fairer tax system, where the wealthiest and corporations pay their fair share. He mentioned that his plan does not raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year and emphasized that it is about leveling the playing field. He criticized big corporations for spending millions of dollars to avoid paying their taxes and pledged to take them on.

Lastly, President Biden called for unity and urged Americans to stick together to accomplish extraordinary things. He expressed confidence in the American people's ability to unite and achieve the goals set forth in his agenda. He reaffirmed his support for Roe v. Wade in response to a question about abortion rights in Texas and mentioned that he is exploring possibilities within the existing law to limit the enforcement of the Texas law.
