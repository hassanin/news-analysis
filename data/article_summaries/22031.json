President Obama issued a statement on the bipartisan immigration reform bill drafted by Senators Schumer and McCain. He acknowledged that the bill is a compromise and not everyone will get everything they wanted, including himself. However, he believes it is largely consistent with the principles he has laid out for comprehensive reform. The bill aims to strengthen border security, hold employers accountable for hiring undocumented workers, provide a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented individuals already in the country, and modernize the legal immigration system to attract highly-skilled entrepreneurs and engineers. President Obama urged the Senate to quickly move the bill forward and expressed his willingness to do whatever it takes to make comprehensive immigration reform a reality.
