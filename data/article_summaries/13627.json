The White House is announcing a new initiative to make it easier for students and families to apply for financial aid for college. Currently, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is available in January, but the new plan will allow students to apply as early as October. In addition, students will be able to electronically retrieve tax information from an earlier year, rather than waiting until tax season. This will give students and families a better understanding of their aid eligibility earlier in the college application process. The goal is to help more students access financial aid and make more informed decisions about college. The President is also calling on Congress to simplify the FAFSA by eliminating up to 30 burdensome questions. Many colleges, universities, scholarship organizations, and non-profit groups have committed to aligning their aid timelines with the earlier FAFSA and helping students complete the application. The President has made college affordability a priority, and this new initiative is part of his efforts to make college more accessible and affordable for all students.
