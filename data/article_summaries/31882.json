President Donald Trump has proclaimed April 2020 as Second Chance Month in the United States. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of offering former inmates the opportunity for redemption and a second chance to become productive members of society. It highlights the First Step Act, a landmark legislation signed into law in 2018, which brought reform to the criminal justice system by reducing penalties and expanding judges' discretion in sentencing. The proclamation also emphasizes the need to help former inmates find rewarding work and promotes second chance hiring. The administration is working on expanding education and training programs for inmates before their release, as well as providing grants to states to help individuals with criminal records find employment. The proclamation calls on all Americans to raise public awareness about preventing crime and supporting those who have completed their sentences.
