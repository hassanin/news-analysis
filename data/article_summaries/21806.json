President Obama and President Medvedev of Russia held a bilateral meeting and discussed two main topics. The first topic was their efforts to conclude a deal on the START treaty, which aims to further reduce nuclear stockpiles. The negotiators have made progress, and both sides are working through technical issues in good faith. The goal is to sign a deal before the end of the year. 

The second topic discussed was Iran's nuclear capacity. President Obama emphasized the desire to resolve the issue in a constructive manner. The United States and Russia have presented two paths to Iran: one that leads to further integration and peaceful nuclear energy, but without nuclear weapons, and another that involves increasing pressure on Iran to meet international obligations. Iran has been unable to agree to the constructive approach so far, and time is running out. The United States and Russia will continue to urge Iran to meet its obligations, but they are also preparing for other pathways if necessary. 

They also discussed other issues, including Afghanistan, economics, and security-related matters. Both presidents expressed satisfaction with the constructive and friendly atmosphere of their discussions. They believe that their efforts contribute to strengthening global security and resolving issues together.
