Five years ago, on this day in Orlando, the LGBTQ+ community in America experienced the deadliest attack in its history. The Pulse nightclub, known for its acceptance and joy, turned into a place of pain and loss. Forty-nine people lost their lives, many were injured, and countless others were deeply affected. The victims were diverse in their backgrounds, representing various races, ethnicities, and identities. Following the tragic event, former President Obama and Joe Biden visited the families of the victims and pledged that the incident would not be forgotten. Biden has since remained in contact with the families and survivors, recognizing the need for action to address gun violence. He plans to sign a bill designating the Pulse nightclub as a national memorial. However, he emphasizes the importance of further measures, such as closing loopholes in background checks, banning assault weapons, implementing extreme risk protection orders, and holding gun manufacturers accountable. Biden also acknowledges the specific impact of gun violence on LGBTQ+ communities, particularly transgender women of color, and calls for the passage of the Equality Act to ensure equal protection under the law. In memory of the Pulse nightclub victims, Biden urges the nation to continue working towards a society that values and safeguards the dignity and safety of every American.
