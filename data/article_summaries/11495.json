In this memorandum, President Barack Obama is determining that it is in the national interest of the United States to waive the application of the prohibition in section 404(a) of the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008 (CSPA) for Libya, South Sudan, and Yemen. Additionally, he waives in part the application of the prohibition in section 404(a) of the CSPA for the Democratic Republic of the Congo to allow for the provision of International Military Education and Training funds, nonlethal Excess Defense Articles, and licenses for direct commercial sales of U.S. origin defense articles. The Secretary of State is directed to submit this determination to Congress, along with the accompanying Memorandum of Justification, and to publish it in the Federal Register.
