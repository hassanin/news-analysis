The White House Press Secretary, Josh Earnest, has criticized the Zika Conference Report proposed by Republicans, stating that it prioritizes political games over the health and safety of Americans, especially pregnant women and their babies. He argues that the plan is four months late and lacks nearly a billion dollars in funding that public health experts have deemed necessary to effectively combat the Zika virus. Earnest also criticizes the plan for diverting funds from other health priorities and limiting birth control services for women in the United States and Puerto Rico, which he believes shows a lack of seriousness in addressing the threat of the Zika virus and protecting Americans.
