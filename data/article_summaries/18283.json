The White House is expressing concern over the intensified fighting in eastern Ukraine and reports of Russian-backed separatists moving heavy weapons and tanks to the front lines. They are calling on all sides to adhere to the cease-fire and warning that any attempt by separatist forces to seize more territory would violate the Minsk agreements. The White House is also urging Russia to honor its commitments in Minsk, including ending military support to the separatists, withdrawing troops and weapons from Ukraine, restoring Ukrainian sovereignty along the border, and releasing all hostages. They emphasize that following the Minsk framework is the best chance for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
