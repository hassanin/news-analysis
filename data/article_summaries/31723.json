President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Texas due to the effects of Hurricane Harvey. Federal aid will be provided to supplement State and local recovery efforts. The declaration makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in several counties, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding will also be available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures. Kevin L. Hannes has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing and more counties and forms of assistance may be designated in the future. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance by registering online or calling the designated phone numbers.
