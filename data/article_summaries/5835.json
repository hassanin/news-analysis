President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed November 2022 as National Lung Cancer Awareness Month. In his statement, he emphasizes the importance of investing in screening, prevention, and treatments for lung cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. While lung cancer rates have decreased due to lower smoking rates and improved immunotherapies, it remains a challenging diagnosis, particularly in rural communities and among Black men. President Biden discusses his commitment to finding a cure for cancer, including through initiatives such as the Cancer Moonshot and the creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H). He also highlights efforts to make cancer care more affordable and accessible, such as capping prescription drug costs and expanding the Affordable Care Act. The administration is also working to reduce exposure to carcinogens, including through proposed bans on menthol-flavored cigarettes and asbestos. President Biden calls on the private sector to contribute to lung cancer research and encourages individuals to quit smoking and undergo regular lung cancer screenings. He emphasizes that fighting cancer is a collective effort that transcends political divisions.
