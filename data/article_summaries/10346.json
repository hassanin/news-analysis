First Lady Michelle Obama and Epicurious are hosting the second Healthy Lunchtime Challenge and Kids' "State Dinner" to promote healthy eating among America's youth. Children and their parents are invited to create and submit an original lunch recipe that is healthy, affordable, and tasty. The recipes must adhere to the USDA's MyPlate guidelines and include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy foods. Fifty-six children and their parent or guardian will be flown to the White House to attend a Kids' "State Dinner" hosted by Mrs. Obama. The winning recipes will be served at the dinner and a downloadable e-cookbook featuring the recipes will be available. The deadline for submissions is May 12th.
