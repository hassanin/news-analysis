The Acting Director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, Ken Cuccinelli, announced a new rule that encourages self-reliance and self-sufficiency for immigrants seeking to come to or stay in the United States. The rule defines "public charge" as an individual who receives one or more designated public benefits for more than 12 months within any 36-month period. It aims to ensure that immigrants are able to support themselves and become successful in the United States. The rule will go into effect on October 15th, 2019, and will be applied prospectively to applications and petitions received after that date. It does not apply to refugees, asylees, trafficking victims, or victims of domestic violence. The rule also excludes certain public benefits received by members of the U.S. Armed Forces and their families, as well as emergency medical services and Medicaid benefits for emergency care. The rule does not consider many forms of government assistance that protect children and pregnant women's health as public benefits. Critics argue that the rule unfairly targets lower-income immigrants and may have a chilling effect on immigrants' use of public services. The rule is seen as part of the Trump administration's efforts to enforce immigration laws and promote self-sufficiency among immigrants.
