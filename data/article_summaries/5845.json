National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan traveled to Israel for a series of meetings with Israeli officials. The meetings focused on the current crisis in Gaza, the humanitarian situation, and the military campaign against Hamas. Sullivan expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself and discussed the phasing of the military campaign, from high-intensity clearance operations to targeted, surgical objectives. The discussions also touched on civilian protection, the humanitarian situation in Gaza, and efforts to get hostages released from Hamas. Sullivan will also visit the West Bank to discuss stability and the role of the Palestinian Authority in setting conditions for a more peaceful future. The US is working with regional partners to address the crisis and pave the way for a viable two-state solution.
