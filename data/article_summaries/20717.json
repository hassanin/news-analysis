The United States expresses strong support for the humanitarian ceasefire announced in Gaza. They urge all parties to exercise restraint until the ceasefire begins, and to fully adhere to their commitments. The US believes that a permanent ceasefire agreement is the only sustainable way to address Israel's security concerns and allow Palestinians in Gaza to live normal lives. They call for Israeli and Palestinian delegations to start negotiations immediately in Cairo, with the aim of achieving a lasting ceasefire. The US is prepared to assist in these negotiations, collaborating with Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, the United Nations, and other regional partners.
