The United States strongly condemns the Iranian government's organized intimidation campaign and arrests of political figures, human rights defenders, political activists, student leaders, journalists, and bloggers. The Iranian government is also blocking internet sites and jamming satellite transmissions, denying its citizens access to information. The US and the world will continue to witness Iran's violation of its citizens' rights and its hypocrisy. The Iranian government should allow active dialogue, freedom of speech, and freedom of assembly without fear. Iranians deserve the same justice and rights that their government promotes abroad.
