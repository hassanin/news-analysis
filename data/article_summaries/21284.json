President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring May 22, 2015, as National Maritime Day. The proclamation recognizes the important role that the United States Merchant Marine plays in our economy and national security. It pays tribute to the brave men and women who have served in the Merchant Marine throughout history, from the privateers who helped secure our independence to the courageous seafarers who navigated perilous waters during World War II. The proclamation also highlights the vital role that Merchant Mariners play in protecting shipping routes, combating piracy, and upholding maritime security. President Obama calls upon the people of the United States to observe National Maritime Day by displaying the American flag and requests that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day.
