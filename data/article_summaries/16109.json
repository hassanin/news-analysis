The article discusses the progress made by the international community in preventing nuclear materials from falling into the wrong hands. In 2009, President Obama called on countries to secure all vulnerable nuclear material within four years. Since then, the world has made substantial progress in securing nuclear materials and preventing illicit trafficking and smuggling. The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution endorsing a comprehensive agenda to secure all nuclear materials. The United States and Russia also completed the implementation of a successful non-proliferation program, converting highly enriched uranium into low-enriched uranium for nuclear power reactors. Through the Nuclear Security Summit process, a global network of experts has been established to work on nuclear security, and bilateral cooperation on nuclear security has been expanded. The article highlights positive trends such as the decreasing number of countries and facilities with highly enriched uranium and plutonium, increased security at storage sites, enhanced abilities to counter nuclear smuggling, and more countries seeking international advice. The nuclear security architecture has also been strengthened through the ratification of key nuclear security treaties and the elevation and better funding of the IAEA's nuclear security team. The United States is committed to continuing its leadership in global nuclear security and working towards reducing the dangers of nuclear weapons and nuclear terrorism while allowing countries to pursue peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
