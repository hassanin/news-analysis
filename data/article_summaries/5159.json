On August 16, 2022, the President signed four laws into effect. The first law, H.R. 2992, known as the "Traumatic Brain Injury and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Law Enforcement Training Act," requires the Justice Department to develop crisis intervention training tools for first responders to recognize and assist individuals suffering from traumatic brain injury or post-traumatic stress disorder. The second law, H.R. 5313, also known as "Reese's Law," establishes safety standards regarding button cell or coin batteries. The third law, H.R. 6943, called the "Public Safety Officer Support Act of 2022," expands eligibility for death and disability benefits under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program to include certain public safety officers who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or acute stress disorder resulting from a traumatic event in the line of duty. Lastly, S. 3451 adds certain technology-related projects to those eligible for special transparency, coordination, and oversight processes for Federal permitting. The President expressed gratitude to the representatives and senators who showed leadership in passing these laws.
