On November 12, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in the United States due to the threat posed by securities investments that finance certain companies of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The President found that the PRC is using US capital to support its military and intelligence activities, posing a threat to the United States. This national emergency was expanded on June 3, 2021, to include the involvement of the PRC's military-industrial complex in research and development programs, weapons production, and the use of Chinese surveillance technology. The President has now extended the national emergency for one year beyond November 12, 2022, due to the continued threat posed by these investments and the use of Chinese surveillance technology.
