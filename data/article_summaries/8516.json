The Havasupai Tribe and certain private nonprofit organizations can receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Additionally, federal funding is available for hazard mitigation measures. Benigno Bern Ruiz has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Further damage assessments may result in additional designations being made in the future. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
