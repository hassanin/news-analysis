The First Family will celebrate their first Christmas in the White House with a theme called "Time-Honored Traditions." First Lady Melania Trump designed the theme to pay respect to 200 years of holiday traditions at the White House. The East Wing features a Gold Star Family Tree, decorated with gold stars and patriotic ribbon, where visitors can write messages to loved ones who are on duty or abroad. The China Room honors dining and hospitality traditions, while the Library showcases President Franklin D. Roosevelt's edition of "A Christmas Carol." The State Floor includes the Grand Foyer and Cross Hall, celebrating the first themed White House Christmas in 1961. The Green Room focuses on crafts, paper, and classic design, while the Blue Room displays the official White House Christmas tree adorned with glass ornaments representing each state and territory. The Red Room is decorated with peppermints, candy, and cookies, and the State Dining Room features a traditional gingerbread house depicting the South facade of the White House. The White House will host over 100 open houses and receptions throughout December, welcoming more than 25,000 visitors on public tours. First Lady Melania Trump wishes everyone a Merry Christmas and joyous holiday season on behalf of the President and Barron.
