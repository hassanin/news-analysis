On October 31, 2021, several countries including the United States, European Union, Australia, Canada, and others met to discuss supply chain disruptions and ways to build long-term resilience. They emphasized the importance of secure, sustainable, and resilient global supply chains for economic prosperity and national security. The countries expressed their intent to work together, along with industry, unions, civil society, and international organizations, to strengthen supply chains. Four key pillars of global supply chain resilience were discussed: transparency, diverse global suppliers, predictability, and partnership. They also invited other economies, companies, and organizations to join their efforts and expressed interest in convening a meeting in 2022 to engage various stakeholders in discussing supply chain security and resilience.
