President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Cuba, which was declared in 1996, will continue beyond February 25, 2018. The policy of the United States is that a mass migration from Cuba would pose a threat to national security and disturb international relations. Unauthorized entry of vessels into Cuban territorial waters is against US law and counter to the purpose of Executive Order 12807, which aims to ensure safe and legal migration. The President has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and the emergency authority regarding the regulation of vessel movement.
