This article is an executive order issued by President Barack Obama on June 14, 2014, establishing an emergency board to investigate disputes between the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) and certain labor organizations representing its employees. The order states that the disputes have not been resolved under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act and that a party has requested the President to establish an emergency board to investigate the issues. The board, consisting of three members appointed by the President, is tasked with investigating and reporting on the disputes within 30 days. During this time, no changes in the conditions related to the disputes can be made by the parties involved, unless agreed upon by both sides. The records and files of the board will be maintained by the National Mediation Board after its termination, which will occur upon the submission of the board's report. The labor organizations involved in the disputes are the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
