Republican state legislators in North Carolina have overturned Governor Roy Cooper's veto of a bill that restricts access to reproductive health care for women. This move is seen as out of touch with the majority of North Carolinians and may make it even more difficult for women to get the care they need. Similar abortion bans in other states have already had devastating impacts on the health and lives of Americans, with women being turned away from emergency rooms and having to travel long distances for care. The North Carolina ban is expected to have similar consequences, harming patients and threatening doctors who provide essential care. President Biden and Vice President Harris will continue to support Governor Cooper and those fighting to protect access to reproductive health care, and will call on Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade for all people in every state.
