First Lady Melania Trump has announced the completion of the new White House tennis pavilion. The project involved refurbishing the White House Tennis Court and Grandchildren's Garden, as well as constructing a new building. Planning for the project began in early 2018 and was approved by the Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission in June 2019. The design of the structure was inspired by the existing architecture of the White House, with elements such as the colonnade, parapet wall, and fanlight windows. The building was funded by private donations and was constructed in partnership with the Trust for the National Mall and the National Park Service. The First Lady hopes that the private space will serve as both a place of leisure and gathering for future First Families.
