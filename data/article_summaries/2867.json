During a visit to Florida International University, Vice President Kamala Harris addressed the urgent need to address climate change. She highlighted the devastating impact of extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts, wildfires, and hurricanes, and emphasized that the time for debate on climate change is over. Harris announced that the administration is investing over $1 billion through FEMA to fund climate resilient projects in hundreds of cities and counties across the country. These projects aim to protect communities from the effects of climate change and create jobs in the clean energy sector. She also emphasized the importance of addressing equity in climate resilience efforts and the administration's commitment to environmental justice. Harris called for immediate action to combat the climate crisis, including passing the recently announced agreement to invest in clean energy and environmental justice. She urged leaders to work together to build a more sustainable, equitable, and resilient future for all.
