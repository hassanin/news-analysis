In response to the Articles of Impeachment submitted by House Democrats, President Donald Trump states that they are a dangerous attack on the American people's right to choose their President. He considers it an unlawful attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election and interfere with the upcoming 2020 election. President Trump accuses Democrats of having a partisan and reckless obsession with impeaching him since the day he took office.
