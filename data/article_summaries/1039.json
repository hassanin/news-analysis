During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre announced the naming of the new press lectern in honor of Alice Dunnigan and Ethel Payne, the first two Black women in the White House press corps. The lectern is a blend of modernity and tradition, symbolizing the resilience and strength of the nation, as well as its rich history and deep-rooted foundations. Jean-Pierre also highlighted the 30th anniversary of the Brady Handgun Prevention Act, which established the background check system that has prevented millions of guns from getting into the hands of domestic abusers and felons. President Biden continues to take action on gun safety, including strengthening background checks and closing loopholes. The briefing also covered updates on the economy, the EPA's proposal to replace lead service lines for safe drinking water, and the upcoming World AIDS Day. Additionally, there were discussions on the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, Russia's actions in Ukraine, and Angola's strategic partnership with the United States.
