President Donald Trump has announced his support for a proposal to shift the air traffic control function of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to an independent, non-profit organization. The safety and regulatory functions would still remain with the FAA. Trump highlighted the inefficiencies and costs of the current system, and emphasized the need for modernization and reform. Privatization of air traffic control has been successfully implemented in other countries, such as Canada, resulting in increased capacity and improved safety. The initiative is expected to benefit air traffic control workers, passengers, airlines, and taxpayers. The privatization of air traffic control is estimated to reduce spending caps and aviation excise taxes.
