The White House has announced the regional finalists for the 2009-2010 Class of White House Fellows. The program, founded in 1964 by President Lyndon Johnson, is a prestigious leadership and public service program. The finalists represent various professions, including technology, education, health care, state government, engineering, business, consulting, law, the non-profit sector, and the military. These finalists will go through a rigorous interview process in March and April, and approximately thirty candidates will be named National Finalists. The President's Commission on White House Fellowships will interview the National Finalists in June and recommend candidates to President Barack Obama for a one-year appointment as White House Fellows. White House Fellows work as full-time special assistants to senior White House Staff, Cabinet Secretaries, and other top-ranking government officials. They also participate in an education program that includes roundtable discussions with renowned leaders and trips to study U.S. policy both domestically and internationally. Selection as a White House Fellow is highly competitive and based on professional achievement, leadership potential, commitment to public service, and the necessary knowledge and skills for high-level government work.
