President Barack Obama has proclaimed September 12-18, 2016, as National Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) Week. HSIs have played a crucial role in increasing access to higher education for Hispanic students in the United States. These institutions have helped more Hispanics earn college degrees and have worked to improve enrollment, retention, and graduation rates. President Obama's administration has invested over $1 billion in HSIs over the past decade and has taken steps to make higher education more affordable, such as expanding Pell Grants and offering tuition tax credits. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of empowering Hispanics and young people to succeed and encourages public officials, educators, and the American people to observe National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week with appropriate programs and activities.
