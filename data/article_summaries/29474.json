According to a report by the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB), small business optimism in the United States is at a record high. This optimism level has only been reached three times in the past 43 years and has consistently remained high throughout the year. The report also states that the number of firms trying to fill job positions is at a 45-year high. Small business owners have expressed record levels of optimism for the past two years, and the NFIB believes that tax relief and reduced regulations have contributed to their success. Companies are also planning to expand and increase their inventory.
