Vice President Biden has called on high school and college students to share their ideas on preventing dating violence and sexual assault at their schools and campuses. Despite progress in reducing violence against women since the Violence Against Women Act was signed into law in 1994, young women aged 16-24 still experience high rates of rape and sexual assault. The Vice President emphasizes the importance of speaking up and taking action to make it clear that violence against women will not be tolerated. He asks students to share what their schools have done to make them feel safer and what ideas they have to prevent violence and make campuses safer. Vice President Biden has been leading the fight against violence against women for over 20 years and has recently focused on addressing the issue among teens and young women. He has introduced guidance for schools on preventing and responding to campus sexual assault and has launched a national competition to develop an innovative app to prevent sexual assault and dating violence.
