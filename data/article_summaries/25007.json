This article discusses a presidential determination made by Barack Obama regarding the continuation of certain authorities under the Trading With the Enemy Act with respect to Cuba. The exercise of these authorities was scheduled to terminate on September 14, 2013, but Obama determined that it is in the national interest of the United States to continue them for an additional year. This determination allows the exercise of these authorities until September 14, 2014, as implemented by the Cuban Assets Control Regulations. The Secretary of the Treasury is directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
