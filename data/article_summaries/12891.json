The White House Communications Director, Dan Pfeiffer, issued a statement emphasizing the importance of passing a bipartisan bill to extend the payroll tax cut. Pfeiffer mentioned that the compromise had received overwhelming support in the Senate, with 89 votes in favor, including 39 from Republicans. Speaker Boehner himself had referred to it as a "good deal" and a "victory." Pfeiffer warned that if House Republicans refused to pass the bill, it would result in a significant tax increase on 160 million Americans in just 13 days, which would harm the economy and job growth. He expressed relief that Republicans were finally willing to support the tax cut for middle-class families, but stressed the need for a one-year deal. Pfeiffer urged House Republicans to stop playing politics and prioritize the needs of the American people.
