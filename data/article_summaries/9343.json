Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech at Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta, Georgia, as part of the "We Can Do This" effort to promote COVID-19 vaccination. She expressed gratitude to the local leaders, including Senator Raphael Warnock and Congressman Hank Johnson, for their work in Georgia. Harris highlighted the importance of community and neighborly love in the fight against the pandemic. She emphasized the power of HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) and recognized the HBCU presidents present at the event. The Vice President discussed the progress made in vaccination efforts, such as surpassing the goal of administering 100 million shots in the first 100 days of the Biden administration. However, she acknowledged that there are still barriers to vaccination, including time constraints, lack of transportation, and misinformation. Harris outlined various initiatives to address these barriers, such as extended pharmacy hours, paid time off for vaccination, free childcare during vaccination and recovery periods, and free rides to vaccination centers provided by rideshare companies. She urged attendees to help spread accurate information about the vaccine and its safety. Harris concluded by emphasizing that getting vaccinated is not just about personal protection but also about building community and the nation's strength.
