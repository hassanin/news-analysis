On February 12, 2010, the President signed H.J. Res. 45, the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 into law. This act increased the public debt limit from $12.394 trillion to $14.294 trillion. It also established a statutory Pay-As-You-Go procedure, which means that any new non-emergency legislation that affects tax revenue or mandatory spending should not increase the Federal deficit.
