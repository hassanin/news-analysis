The White House has released state-by-state data on how the Biden-Harris Administration's plan for student debt relief will benefit borrowers in all fifty states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. The plan aims to provide up to $20,000 in debt relief to Pell Grant recipients and up to $10,000 to other borrowers. It is estimated that over 40 million borrowers are eligible for the relief plan, and nearly 20 million borrowers could have their entire remaining balance discharged. The relief plan is intended to help borrowers and families recover from the pandemic and prepare for student loan payments resuming in January 2023. Almost 90% of the relief dollars will go to those earning less than $75,000 per year, with no relief going to individuals or households in the top 5% of incomes in the United States. By targeting relief to borrowers with the highest economic need, the plan is also expected to help narrow the racial wealth gap. The Department of Education will release additional details on how individuals can benefit from the plan in the coming weeks.
