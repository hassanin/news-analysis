The United Nations Security Council has authorized a Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission for Haiti, with Kenya serving as the lead nation. Other nations, including Jamaica, The Bahamas, and Antigua and Barbuda, have pledged to join the mission. The goal is to bring much-needed relief to Haiti, which has been plagued by violence. The international community must now focus on mobilizing support to deploy the mission swiftly, effectively, and safely. The aim is to create a safe environment for the people of Haiti to rebuild their lives and hold democratic elections.
