President Obama announced that the United States will continue to deploy a small number of military advisors to assist Uganda and other regional forces in pursuing the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and protecting local populations. The U.S. remains deeply engaged in supporting efforts to end the threat posed by the LRA and reduce the human consequences of their atrocities. The U.S. strategy focuses on protecting civilians, apprehending LRA leaders, promoting defections from the LRA, and providing humanitarian relief. The LRA has committed atrocities for over two decades, including murder, rape, and kidnapping. The U.S. believes that the advisors are making progress despite challenges, and the collaboration with affected states is crucial. Efforts are being made to encourage defections from the LRA and support reintegration, while also strengthening early warning networks and providing humanitarian assistance to affected communities. The U.S. is working with regional partners, such as the African Union and the United Nations, to address the LRA threat and increase the protection of civilians. The Government of Uganda has made significant efforts in stabilizing the northern part of the country and supporting post-conflict recovery. The U.S. has played a leading role in supporting the recovery in northern Uganda.
