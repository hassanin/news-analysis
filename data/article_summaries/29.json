The Acting Administrator Slavitt, along with Drs. Walensky and Fauci, discussed the next phase of the U.S. vaccination effort in a press briefing. The President announced a new goal of getting 70 percent of adults vaccinated with at least one shot and 160 million Americans fully vaccinated by July 4th. The government has built an infrastructure with millions of vaccines, vaccination locations, and community relationships to help achieve this goal. They emphasized the importance of making it easy for every American to get vaccinated. They provided various ways to find vaccination locations, including texting your ZIP code to GETVAX or VACUNA, visiting Vaccines.gov, or going to over 75,000 vaccination sites. They also mentioned the availability of walk-in vaccinations and partnerships with companies like Uber and Lyft to provide free and discounted rides. Efforts are being made to reach people in rural areas and those without access to broadband or cell phones. The briefing also emphasized the importance of addressing vaccine hesitancy and encouraged those who have been vaccinated to share their experiences with others. The officials highlighted the progress made in decreasing cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, but also emphasized the need to continue vaccination efforts and follow prevention measures due to the risk of emerging variants. Dr. Fauci discussed the relative protection provided by natural infection and vaccination, highlighting the effectiveness of vaccines in producing stronger antibody responses and providing better protection against variants. The briefing also addressed questions about vaccine distribution to other countries, the use of masks at summer camps, and the potential future lifting of restrictions as vaccination rates increase.
