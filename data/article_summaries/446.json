The Biden-Harris Administration has launched the American Climate Corps, a workforce training and service initiative that aims to provide more young people with the skills and training needed for careers in the clean energy and climate resilience economy. The program will mobilize over 20,000 Americans to work on conserving and restoring lands and waters, advancing environmental justice, deploying clean energy, and implementing energy-efficient technologies. The announcement has been praised by environmental leaders, congressional leaders, and various organizations for its focus on creating good-paying jobs, addressing the climate crisis, and advancing environmental justice.
