First Lady Melania Trump traveled to Miami to unveil the new "Morton and Linda Bouchard Healing Garden" at Nicklaus Children's Hospital. The healing garden will provide comfort and reprieve for patients and their families. She also revealed the new name of the "Esrick Dream Foundation Cardiac Intensive Care Floor" at the hospital. Nicklaus Children's Hospital is the only licensed specialty hospital for children in South Florida and has the largest pediatric teaching program in the southeastern United States. The addition of the healing garden aligns with the First Lady's Be Best initiative, which focuses on the well-being of children. Mrs. Trump expressed gratitude to the generous donors who made the healing garden possible and thanked Jack and Barbara Nicklaus for inviting her to the event. She also participated in a butterfly release with Barbara Nicklaus and visited with children on the Cardiac Intensive Care Floor before leaving.
