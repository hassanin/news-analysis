Ivanka Trump, Advisor to the President, has announced a new White House initiative to address the challenges posed by technology to the workforce. The initiative aims to provide better workforce training and create more job opportunities for Americans. The National Council for the American Worker will be established to develop a national strategy for training and retraining workers for high-demand industries. An advisory board, consisting of leaders from various sectors, will work with the administration to implement job-training programs. Companies and trade groups are also asked to sign the Pledge to America's Workers, committing to invest in the current and future workforce. The goal is to ensure that every American can move from an entry-level job into a lifelong career, fostering a workforce culture that prioritizes lifelong learning. The initiative aims to prepare American workers for the rapid changes in the economy and maintain their status as pioneers in the 21st century.
