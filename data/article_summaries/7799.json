The President recently held three meetings with congressional Democrats to discuss the Build Back Better Act and the bipartisan infrastructure deal. The meetings involved Democrats from both Chambers and represented a range of views. The President engaged with Members and progress was made towards finding a way to lower costs for the middle class and focus on investing in families rather than benefiting big corporations and the wealthiest taxpayers. More work lies ahead, and follow-up meetings will be held in the coming days to continue advancing these bills.
