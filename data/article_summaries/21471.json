President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Oregon, providing federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts after a severe winter storm in February 2014. The declaration allows for federal funding to be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. Thomas J. Dargan has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
