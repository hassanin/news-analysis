On September 8, 2017, President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation declaring the period from September 8 to September 10 as National Days of Prayer and Remembrance. These days serve as a time for the nation to reflect on the tragic events of September 11, 2001, when nearly 3,000 innocent people lost their lives. The proclamation calls for prayers for the families who lost loved ones and for the comfort and peace that comes from knowing that the victims will be forever remembered. It also pays tribute to the lives lost at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and on United Flight 93, as well as the brave first responders who risked their lives to save others. The proclamation emphasizes the resilience of the American spirit and the determination not to let terrorists defeat the nation. President Trump encourages the people of the United States and people around the world to participate in prayer, contemplation, memorial services, visiting memorials, ringing bells, and evening candlelight remembrance vigils during these National Days of Prayer and Remembrance.
