On the International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict, the United States has issued historic sanctions targeting individuals who perpetrate this abuse. This is the first time that a dedicated focus on conflict-related sexual violence has led to the imposition of U.S. sanctions. The sanctions target two political and military figures from South Sudan who oversaw the rape and murder of civilians during the civil war, as well as two ISIS terrorists responsible for the brutal rape and torture of Yazidi women and girls. The United States is committed to ending gender-based violence and supporting survivors, and will continue to lead the effort to hold perpetrators accountable for this grave abuse of human rights.
