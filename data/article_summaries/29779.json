President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Kansas and has ordered Federal assistance to help with recovery efforts following a severe winter storm, snowstorm, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred from April 28 to May 3, 2017. The Federal funding will be available to State and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The affected counties include Cherokee, Cheyenne, Crawford, Decatur, Finney, Gove, Graham, Grant, Greeley, Hamilton, Haskell, Kearny, Lane, Logan, Morton, Neosho, Norton, Rawlins, Scott, Seward, Sheridan, Sherman, Stanton, Stevens, Thomas, Wallace, and Wichita. Additionally, Federal funding will be available for snow removal in certain counties, and for hazard mitigation measures statewide. David G. Samaniego has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas, with the possibility of additional designations in the future.
