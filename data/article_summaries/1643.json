In a statement, President Joe Biden provided an update on the health of Nancy and Paul Pelosi, stating that Paul Pelosi is doing better and expected to fully recover. He also mentioned that the incident appeared to be intended for Nancy Pelosi. The President emphasized that it is not enough to condemn the violence, but also necessary to condemn those who continue to spread false claims about the election being stolen, as this rhetoric contributes to the violence. He urged for an end to this talk. When asked about a stampede in South Korea that resulted in the deaths of 146 people, President Biden said he would make a statement once he had more information. Regarding the upcoming midterms, he expressed confidence and mentioned his plans to campaign in various states, emphasizing that it is not a referendum but a choice between two different visions for the country. President Biden also condemned Russia's decision to suspend the U.N. grain deal with Ukraine, calling it outrageous and stating that it would increase starvation without any valid reason. He expressed his support for John Fetterman in Pennsylvania and praised his courage and strong stance.
