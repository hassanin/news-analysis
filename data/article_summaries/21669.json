President Obama has signed a Presidential Memorandum committing the Federal government to make available 500 MHz of Federal and commercial spectrum over the next 10 years. This will help meet the increasing demand for mobile and fixed broadband and stimulate investment, economic growth, and job creation. The spectrum will be used for mobile broadband, other high-value uses, and benefit other industries. The plan includes legislation to incentivize commercial and Federal users to use spectrum more efficiently. The freed-up spectrum will double the amount currently available for smartphones, wireless broadband, and new forms of communication. The revenue potential from spectrum auctions is estimated to be in the tens of billions of dollars, which will be invested in public safety, infrastructure, and deficit reduction. The plan also aims to create win-win solutions by reallocating spectrum to its most valuable use, benefiting existing users and enabling new investments. The administration will evaluate and develop a plan for a nationwide interoperable mobile broadband network for public safety. The four-point plan includes identifying and planning for the release of spectrum, providing tools for effective reallocation, enabling spectrum to be put to its highest value uses, and using auction proceeds for public safety, infrastructure, and deficit reduction. The plan aims to meet the increasing demand for mobile broadband and stimulate economic growth and job creation.
