On November 1, 2012, President Obama made calls to state and local officials to discuss the recovery efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. He spoke with New York Governor Cuomo and they planned to have another call later in the day with other local officials. The President also held conference calls with officials from New Jersey and Connecticut to ensure that federal resources were being utilized effectively and to address any bureaucratic obstacles. FEMA Administrator Fugate joined all of these calls. The call with New Jersey officials involved Governor Christie and over 700 officials from across the state, while the call with Connecticut officials included Governor Malloy.
