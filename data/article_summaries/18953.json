President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Mississippi due to severe storms and flooding. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in the counties of Bolivar, Coahoma, and Washington. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover. Federal funding is also available for hazard mitigation measures statewide. Lai Sun Yee has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. seven days a week.
