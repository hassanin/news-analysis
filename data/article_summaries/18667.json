First Lady Michelle Obama has announced a health and wellness commitment in the restaurant industry, partnering with Darden Restaurants and the Partnership for a Healthier America. Darden, the world's largest full-service restaurant company, will be making changes to both kids' menus and full menus in order to reduce calorie and sodium footprints. The company aims to achieve a 10 percent reduction in calories and sodium over five years and a 20 percent reduction over ten years. On kids' menus, fruits or vegetables will be the default side option and 1-percent milk will be the default beverage choice with free refills. These changes will be fully implemented by July 2012. Additionally, Darden will be improving the nutritional content of children's menu items to meet specific criteria. The company's commitment aligns with the Childhood Obesity Task Force Report, which encourages restaurants to provide healthier options and make healthy choices the default.
