In this article, President Biden references a line from Irish poet William Butler Yeats, "Too long a suffering makes a stone of the heart," and expresses his admiration for the resilience of the people he has met. He recalls a conversation with former Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, who told him that Jews have no place else to go and that if there weren't an Israel, it would have to be invented. Biden believes that the security and safety of Jews worldwide is anchored in the continued vibrance of the State of Israel. He expresses his desire to have a private conversation and mentions being shown data by the Defense Department.
