President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Connecticut and has ordered Federal assistance to aid in recovery efforts from severe storms and flooding that occurred from September 25 to September 26, 2018. Federal funding will be available to State, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, to help with emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The counties of Middlesex and New London, including the Mashantucket Pequot Indian Tribe and Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut located within New London County, are eligible for this assistance. Hazard mitigation measures throughout the State are also eligible for funding. James N. Russo has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas, and additional designations may be made in the future based on damage assessments.
