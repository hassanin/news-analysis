In a statement at Palm Beach International Airport, President Trump declared that the investigation into collusion with Russia during the 2016 election had found no evidence of wrongdoing. He referred to the investigation as a "shame" and an "illegal takedown" that failed. Trump emphasized that there was no collusion or obstruction, and called it a "complete and total exoneration." He expressed hope that someone would investigate the other side, suggesting that there were illegal activities committed by those investigating him. The statement lasted for about two minutes.
