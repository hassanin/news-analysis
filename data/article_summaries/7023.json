President Biden has declared a major disaster in Virginia and authorized federal assistance to support recovery efforts following a severe winter storm and snowstorm that occurred in early January. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to Commonwealth, tribal, and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The affected areas include numerous counties and the independent city of Fredericksburg. In addition, federal funding is available for snow assistance in the counties of King George and Stafford. Hazard mitigation measures are also eligible for federal cost-sharing throughout Virginia. Gerard M. Stolar has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Further designations may be made in the future based on damage assessments.
