The article is a memorandum from President Barack Obama, titled "Managing Government Records," which begins an effort to reform records management policies and practices in the executive branch. The purpose of improving records management is to enhance performance, promote openness and accountability, and minimize costs. Well-managed records can be used to assess program impact, reduce redundancy, save money, and share knowledge. The memorandum highlights the challenges and opportunities created by technological advances in agency operations, particularly the increase in volume and diversity of information that agencies must manage. It emphasizes the need for a 21st-century framework for the management of government records that will provide a foundation for open government, improve agency performance, and reduce costs. The memorandum also outlines the commitments that agency heads must make to support records management reform and directs agencies to submit reports on their current plans for improving their records management programs. It further calls for the issuance of a Records Management Directive that will direct agency heads to take specific steps to reform and improve records management policies and practices. The directive will focus on creating a more efficient and cost-effective government-wide records management framework, enhancing agency capabilities to fulfill their missions, maintaining accountability through documentation, increasing open government and public access to records, and transitioning from paper-based to electronic records management where feasible. The memorandum concludes with general provisions and authorizes the Archivist to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
