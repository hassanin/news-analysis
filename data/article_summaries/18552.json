President Barack Obama has notified Congress of his intention to terminate the designation of Seychelles as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) program. This decision is based on the determination that Seychelles has become a "high income" country and is therefore no longer eligible for the benefits provided under the AGOA. The termination will be effective from January 1, 2017.
