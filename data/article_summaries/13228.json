Vice President Joe Biden spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi about ongoing military operations in Iraq, specifically in Anbar and Salah ah Din provinces. Biden expressed his support for Abadi's leadership in the fight against ISIL and welcomed Abadi's call for the protection of civilians and the control of armed groups by the state. Biden also commended Abadi for building a national front before launching the operation near Tikrit and praised the efforts to enable fighters from Salah ah Din to reclaim their territory and ensure the return of displaced populations after ISIL is defeated. Both leaders reaffirmed the importance of the strategic partnership between Iraq and the United States and agreed to continue their close security cooperation as Iraqi forces take on ISIL.
