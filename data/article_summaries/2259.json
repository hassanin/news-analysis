President Biden has directed FEMA to appoint a Federal Disaster Recovery Coordinator to oversee long-term recovery efforts in East Palestine, Ohio, and nearby communities affected by the Norfolk Southern train derailment. The Biden-Harris Administration has mobilized a comprehensive response, with the EPA deploying a team to support emergency and environmental response efforts, the DOT investigating the cause of the derailment, and FEMA coordinating with state and local partners. The EPA has ordered Norfolk Southern to clean up the environmental damage, including soil and water contamination, and cover the government's response costs. Ongoing testing is being conducted to monitor contamination levels. President Biden has issued an Executive Order to ensure Norfolk Southern remains accountable, address long-term effects, and provide federal assistance to affected communities if needed. The order specifies actions for FEMA, EPA, HHS, and DOT.
