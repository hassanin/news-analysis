Iran has released five Americans from prison and placed them under house arrest. The individuals, Siamak Namazi, Morad Tahbaz, Emad Shargi, and two others who wish to remain anonymous, were unjustly detained and should not have been in prison. The United States will continue to monitor their condition and work towards securing their release. Negotiations for their eventual release are ongoing and delicate, so details about their house arrest and the efforts to secure their freedom are limited. The goal is to bring all of them back home to the United States.
