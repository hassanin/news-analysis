On June 3, 2013, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 258, known as the "Stolen Valor Act of 2013," makes it a federal crime for someone to falsely claim to have received military decorations or medals in order to gain money, property, or other benefits. The second bill, S. 982, called the "Freedom to Fish Act," prohibits the Army Corps of Engineers from creating restricted areas that would prevent public access to water downstream of dams and other structures in the Cumberland River basin.
