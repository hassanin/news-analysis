President Trump has signed three executive orders aimed at fighting crime, gangs, and drugs, restoring law and order, and supporting law enforcement. These orders acknowledge the violence and threats against law enforcement officials and seek to show support for them. The first order places the government firmly on the side of law enforcement and ensures funding supports officers on the street while aggressively prosecuting anyone who tries to harm them. The second order instructs the Attorney General to form a task force to reduce crime and increase public safety. The third order instructs the Attorney General to form a separate task force to focus on destroying transnational criminal organizations and drug cartels that bring drugs and violence to neighborhoods. These groups will no longer operate with impunity in the United States or the hemisphere.
