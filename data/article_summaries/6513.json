The White House has announced private sector commitments in response to President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden's call to action on cancer screening. These commitments are aimed at achieving the Cancer Moonshot goal of reducing the death rate from cancer by at least 50 percent over the next 25 years. The initiatives include efforts to improve cancer screening, enhance prevention, address inequities, target effective treatments, develop approaches for deadly and rare cancers, support patients, survivors, and caregivers, and learn more from people living with cancer. The private sector commitments include bringing high-quality care to underserved areas, providing mobile lung cancer screening in rural communities, offering support and bilingual navigation services to specific populations, and encouraging employees to get recommended cancer screenings. The goal is to ensure that all Americans have access to the tools needed to prevent, detect, and diagnose cancer.
