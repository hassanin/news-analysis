The United States has a Security Sector Assistance Policy that aims to strengthen its ability to help allies and partner nations build their own security capacity. This policy recognizes the need for collaboration among the US Government, allies, partners, and multilateral organizations to address the diverse and complex threats to national interests. The US provides assistance to help countries fight terrorism, counter criminal networks, participate in peacekeeping operations, and build institutions capable of maintaining security and justice. By building security capacity in partner nations, the US aims to reduce the need for intervention abroad. However, the US cannot provide assistance to all countries and must be selective based on foreign policy and national security objectives. The goals of US security sector assistance include building sustainable capacity, promoting partner support for US interests, promoting universal values, and strengthening collective security. To achieve these goals, the US must ensure consistency with broader national security goals, foster interagency collaboration, build sustainable capacity through comprehensive strategies, be selective in resource allocation, be responsive to changing security environments, ensure short-term interventions align with long-term goals, inform policy with rigorous analysis, plan and act regionally, and coordinate with other donors.
