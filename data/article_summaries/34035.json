President Donald Trump commends Congress for setting aside partisan politics and swiftly providing resources for first responders, local officials, and Federal emergency management personnel to address natural disasters in the country. The passing of H.R. 601 allocates an additional $15.25 billion in emergency appropriations for disaster relief and extends the authorization of the National Flood Insurance Program until December 8th. The President emphasizes the importance of unity and reassures those affected by Hurricane Irma that his administration prioritizes the needs of the American people over partisan politics.
