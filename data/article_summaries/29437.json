President Donald Trump has returned H.J. Res. 76, a joint resolution, without his approval. The resolution aims to nullify the Borrower Defense Institutional Accountability Regulation, which was implemented by the Department of Education in September 2019. The regulation sets clear standards for borrower defense to repayment, providing transparency for students and schools. It aims to protect students and taxpayers by holding educational institutions accountable. The President argues that the regulation puts the needs of students first and encourages schools to support students in completing their education. He believes that the resolution would return the country to a regulatory regime where the government and state attorneys general determine the education students receive and the schools they can attend. The President emphasizes the need for American higher education to transform and become more affordable, flexible, and innovative. He expresses his willingness to work with Congress to develop a system that better meets the needs of students and holds schools responsible for student success. President Trump concludes that H.J. Res. 76 is a misguided resolution that would increase costs for students and limit their ability to choose the education that best suits their needs.
