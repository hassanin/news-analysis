President Biden will announce an Executive Order aimed at increasing background checks for firearm sales and implementing "red flag" laws to keep guns out of dangerous hands. The order also seeks to hold the gun industry accountable and urges the Federal Trade Commission to analyze how gun manufacturers market firearms to minors. The President will visit Monterey Park, California, to support the families affected by a mass shooting earlier this year. Last year, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act into law, and he continues to call on Congress to take further action, such as banning assault weapons and requiring background checks for all gun sales. The Executive Order includes additional measures to reduce gun violence and support impacted communities.
