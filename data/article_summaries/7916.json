President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has issued a proclamation recognizing Transgender Day of Visibility and expressing support for transgender, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming individuals. The President, along with the First Lady, Vice President, Second Gentleman, and the entire Administration, acknowledges the resilience and strength of the transgender community. While progress has been made, discrimination, harassment, and barriers to opportunity still exist for transgender Americans, particularly transgender women and girls of color who face high levels of violence. The President condemns the numerous anti-transgender bills proposed across the country, which target transgender kids and undermine their humanity. The Administration is committed to advancing equity, civil rights, and non-discrimination protections for transgender people. The President has signed an Executive Order to combat discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation and urges Congress to pass the Equality Act. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to support and uplift the lives and voices of transgender individuals and work towards eliminating discrimination against all marginalized communities. March 31, 2022, is officially declared as Transgender Day of Visibility by President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
