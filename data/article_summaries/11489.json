President Obama has signed an Executive Order authorizing sanctions to be imposed on individuals and entities that threaten the peace, security, and stability of Yemen by disrupting the political transition. The order allows the United States to take action against those who seek to undermine Yemen's transition and the Yemeni people's desire for change. The President believes that addressing Yemen's urgent humanitarian and security challenges is not possible if political progress stalls. The United States strongly supports Yemen's political transition and will work with international partners, including the Gulf Cooperation Council, to help Yemen move towards a more secure, democratic, and prosperous future.
