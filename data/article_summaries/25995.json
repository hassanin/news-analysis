Second Lady Karen Pence and Acting Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs Pamela Powers visited the John D. Dingell VA Medical Center in Detroit. They participated in an art therapy roundtable, where they learned about the facility's art therapy program for veterans. Mrs. Pence delivered remarks about her passion for art therapy, and veterans shared their experiences with the program. They also attended a veteran suicide prevention roundtable, where they met with the VA's prevention suicide team and learned about their program. After the medical center visit, they visited a military spouse and veteran-owned business called Le'Host Hair and Wigs, which specializes in wigs for veterans and cancer patients. They learned about the salon's work with the Small Business Administration and how they have adapted during the pandemic. Second Lady Karen Pence expressed her inspiration from learning about military spouse and veteran entrepreneurship and the programs available for veterans struggling with PTSD or suicidal feelings. The John D. Dingell VA Medical Center provides services to approximately 200,000 veterans in the Detroit area. The Trump administration has implemented reforms to improve care and benefits for veterans, resulting in increased veteran trust in the VA.
