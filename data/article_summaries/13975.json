The White House has released a fact sheet outlining steps being taken to strengthen community policing and build trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve. The fact sheet highlights the importance of collaborative relationships between police and the communities they protect. The White House conducted a review of federal funding and programs that provide equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies (LEAs), finding a lack of consistency in how these programs are structured and implemented. The report identifies four areas of focus for improvement: local community engagement, federal coordination and oversight, training requirements, and the community policing model. The President has instructed relevant agencies to work together to develop specific recommendations within 120 days. The fact sheet also mentions the creation of a Task Force on 21st Century Policing, chaired by Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey and Laurie Robinson, a professor at George Mason University. This task force will examine issues related to effective crime reduction and building public trust, and will prepare a report with recommendations within 90 days. Additionally, the President proposes a three-year $263 million investment package to increase the use of body-worn cameras, expand training for law enforcement agencies, support police department reform, and facilitate community and local law enforcement engagement. A new Body Worn Camera Partnership Program would provide a 50% match to states and localities for the purchase of body-worn cameras. The overall initiative aims to build trust between communities and law enforcement.
