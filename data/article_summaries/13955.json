President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the state of Montana, ordering federal aid to help with recovery efforts from severe storms, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred from August 21-25, 2014. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to state, tribal, and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures will also be funded on a cost-sharing basis throughout the state. The Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area has been named as Benigno Bern Ruiz, and additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments.
