President Obama delivered a speech at the National Defense University, outlining the framework for the U.S. counter-terrorism strategy as the war in Afghanistan winds down. He highlighted that the threat of terrorism has evolved since 9/11, with Al Qaeda's core being decimated in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but new threats emerging from affiliates and localized extremist groups. The President emphasized the need for a comprehensive strategy, including partnerships with other countries, to combat these threats. He discussed the standards for taking lethal action, such as targeted drone strikes, and addressed concerns about legality, accountability, and civilian casualties. The President also emphasized the importance of oversight and authorities, including briefing Congress on strikes and engaging in debates about the use of force. He mentioned the need for diplomatic engagement and assistance to address underlying grievances and conflicts that fuel extremism. The President highlighted the challenge of domestic radicalization and the importance of working with the American Muslim community to prevent violence. He emphasized the need to balance security and civil liberties, reviewing authorities, and establishing privacy protections. The President expressed his desire to close Guantanamo and urged Congress to lift restrictions on detainee transfers. He announced the lifting of the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen, with a case-by-case review, and emphasized the importance of judicial review for every detainee.
