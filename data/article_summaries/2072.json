The Biden-Harris Administration has repeatedly warned about the potential for Russia to engage in malicious cyber activity against the United States. There is now intelligence suggesting that Russia may be exploring options for cyberattacks. The Administration has prioritized strengthening cybersecurity defenses since day one, with President Biden's Executive Order modernizing Federal Government defenses and improving technology security. Public-private action plans have been launched to enhance cybersecurity in the electricity, pipeline, and water sectors. The Administration has also worked internationally to detect and disrupt ransomware threats, hold accountable nations that harbor ransomware criminals, and publicly attribute malicious activity. The U.S. Government will continue to provide resources and tools to the private sector and defend the nation against cyberattacks. However, much of the critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector, and companies must take steps to protect these services. Additionally, there is a focus on bolstering America's cybersecurity in the long term, with encouragement for technology and software companies to take action.
