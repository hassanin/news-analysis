President Obama and Vice President Biden will be visiting Kokomo, Indiana on November 23, 2010 as part of their White House to Main Street Tour. The community of Kokomo has been able to recover from economic hardships with the help of investments from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the Obama Administration's auto industry restructuring plan. Kokomo has been able to provide economic relief for middle-class families and invest in new industries and technologies. The visit will include a tour of Indiana Transmission, a Chrysler plant in Kokomo. In recent years, Kokomo has faced plant closings, layoffs, and a high unemployment rate. However, with the help of the Recovery Act and auto restructuring, the city has experienced revitalization. Kokomo Mayor Greg Goodnight has been able to leverage Recovery Act funds to revitalize downtown, resulting in the opening of new small businesses. The auto industry restructuring has also been beneficial for Kokomo, with Chrysler's presence generating significant property taxes for the city. Kokomo has received over $400 million in direct Recovery Act funding for various programs and projects, including the expansion of manufacturing capacity for hybrid vehicles components, the establishment of a new solar PV plant, energy-efficient lighting installations, infrastructure improvements, funding for schools and colleges, and support for small businesses. Overall, the Recovery Act has created or saved 71,000 jobs in Indiana and over $6.2 billion has been spent in the state.
