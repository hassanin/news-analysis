According to an article from The Washington Times, a briefer from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was not allowed to speak during a closed-door meeting where negotiators were discussing a homeland security spending deal and the border wall. The article claims that if the ICE briefer had been allowed to speak, he would have warned that proposed limits on immigrant detention, supported by Democrats, would result in the release of 30,000 people, including thousands of migrants with criminal records. The availability of detention beds for illegal immigrants is seen as a critical factor in reducing illegal immigration. ICE argues that reducing the number of detention beds would lead to the release of dangerous migrants and hinder efforts to deter illegal immigration and remove criminals from American communities. The article also mentions that there are approximately one million migrants who have been ordered to be deported but are still free in the U.S. ICE states that without sufficient funding and detention authority, they will only be able to remove a small percentage of family units, contributing to the border crisis.
