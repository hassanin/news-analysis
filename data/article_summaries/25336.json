The booming U.S. economy, thanks to the Trump administration's pro-growth policies, has brought a new challenge to the forefront: a shortage of workers with the right skills. Despite recent progress, millions of Americans who could work remain out of the labor force. To address this issue, it is crucial to effectively build workers' skills and bring more nonworking Americans into the workforce. The demand for workers who can learn new skills is only expected to grow as automation and artificial intelligence continue to change the economy. Smarter investment in workers is needed to ensure a more flexible workforce and continued economic growth in the future.
