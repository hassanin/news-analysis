In this statement, President Obama discusses the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and the actions taken by the United States and its allies to address it. He announces that he has signed an executive order authorizing sanctions on individuals and entities responsible for violating Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The State Department has also implemented travel restrictions on certain individuals and officials. These measures are intended to impose costs on Russia and those responsible for the situation in Crimea. President Obama emphasizes the international unity in condemning Russia's actions and supporting Ukraine. He criticizes the proposed referendum on the future of Crimea, stating that it would violate the Ukrainian constitution and international law. The President proposes a path to de-escalation, which includes allowing international monitors into all of Ukraine, beginning consultations between Russia and Ukraine with international participation, and supporting Ukraine's move towards elections in May. He calls on Congress to take action to support Ukraine financially and to support the International Monetary Fund's capacity to lend resources to Ukraine. President Obama concludes by stating that the United States is committed to upholding international law and pursuing a just outcome for Ukraine.
