Helen Chavez, wife of Cesar Chavez, passed away at the age of 88. She dedicated her life to organizing farmworkers in California and throughout the US, fighting for better working conditions and wages. Helen managed her union's finances, cooked meals, participated in picket lines, and was even arrested for her activism. She believed in the dignity of farmworkers and worked alongside them while raising eight children. President Obama had the privilege of meeting Helen when he designated her and Cesar's home as the Cesar E. Chavez National Monument. He sends his condolences to her family and celebrates her impactful life.
