The President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) has released a report urging efforts to improve domestic manufacturing competitiveness and encourage companies to invest in the United States. The report, Capturing Domestic Competitive Advantage in Advanced Manufacturing, calls for sustaining investments in science and technology, establishing a National Network of Manufacturing Innovation Institutes, upgrading workforce training programs, and encouraging investment through tax, regulatory, energy, and trade policies. The report emphasizes the importance of a strong manufacturing sector in achieving a strong middle class and a lasting economy. The Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP), created by the President, aims to revitalize the manufacturing sector through collaboration between industry, academia, and government. The report builds on the momentum of last year’s PCAST report, Ensuring American Leadership in Advanced Manufacturing. The AMP Steering Committee, composed of leaders in business and academia, developed the recommendations by consulting stakeholders and experts representing various sectors. The report highlights the role of manufacturing in job creation, economic growth, and addressing the trade deficit. The President’s comprehensive plan to revitalize American manufacturing includes initiatives such as the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation and business tax reform. The Advanced Manufacturing Partnership Steering Committee consists of CEOs from manufacturing firms and universities.
