President Donald J. Trump has issued an executive order, Executive Order 13862, which revokes an annual reporting requirement related to counterterrorism strikes carried out by the United States outside areas of active hostilities. This revocation is in accordance with section 1264(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. The decision to revoke the reporting requirement was made after evaluating the existing requirements specified by Congress in the Act, and considering a more comprehensive report submitted to Congress by the Department of Defense pursuant to section 1057 of the Act. The United States Government remains committed to minimizing civilian casualties and complying with its obligations under the law of armed conflict.
