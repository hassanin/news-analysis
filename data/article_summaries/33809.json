On December 19, 2018, the President signed four new laws. The first law, H.R. 1872, called the "Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018," promotes access for diplomats, officials, journalists, and others from the United States to Tibetan areas of China. The second law, H.R. 2454, known as the "Department of Homeland Security Data Framework Act of 2018," requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop a data framework that integrates existing DHS datasets and systems. This framework will be accessible to authorized DHS personnel while adhering to legal authorities and protecting privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. The third law, H.R. 3996, named the "Protecting Access to the Courts for Taxpayers Act," allows Federal courts to transfer certain cases to the United States Tax Court. Lastly, H.R. 4111, the "Spurring Business in Communities Act of 2017," amends the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. Its goal is to increase the number of small business investment companies in states that have fewer licensed companies.
