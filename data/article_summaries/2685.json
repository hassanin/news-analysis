The Vice President of the United States will be making a historic announcement in Dalton, Georgia as part of the Biden-Harris administration's Investing in America tour. The Vice President will tour a Qcells solar panel manufacturing facility and announce a commitment between Qcells and Summit Ridge Energy to deploy 1.2 gigawatts of community solar power, the largest community solar purchase in American history. These projects will generate enough clean electricity to power 140,000 homes and businesses and benefit underserved communities. The announcement is a result of the Biden administration's pro-climate actions and investments in clean energy. The administration is focused on creating a clean energy economy, creating jobs, and lowering costs for working families. Georgia has already received $131 billion in private-sector manufacturing investments, primarily in clean energy and electric vehicle manufacturing. The Vice President's visit to Dalton is part of the administration's efforts to showcase the impact of their investments and the potential consequences if the Inflation Reduction Act is repealed. The administration is committed to turning America into a magnet for private investment and is seeing significant demand for clean energy technologies across various sectors, including rural areas, low- and moderate-income communities, and utility companies. The Q&A session addressed specific details about the project, including the incentives provided by the Inflation Reduction Act and the demand for solar energy. The administration is optimistic about the growth of the clean energy economy and the positive impact it will have on communities and job creation.
