They note that the Ethiopian government has restricted political space for opposition, civil society, and independent media. The US calls on all parties to reject violence and urges the government to address concerns and disputes. They emphasize the importance of fundamental rights and express commitment to working with Ethiopia for strengthened democratic institutions and open political dialogue.
