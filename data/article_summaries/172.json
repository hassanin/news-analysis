President Biden is announcing a plan to expand health coverage for DACA recipients. The Department of Health and Human Services will propose a rule to include DACA recipients in the definition of "lawful presence" for Medicaid and Affordable Care Act coverage. If finalized, this rule will make DACA recipients eligible for these programs for the first time. They will be able to apply for coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace and state Medicaid agencies. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to providing opportunities and support for Dreamers. While waiting for Congress to act, DACA recipients should take advantage of the federal programs and resources available to them.
