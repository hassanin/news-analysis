President Obama expressed his sadness at the passing of Richard Estrada Chavez, who dedicated his life to serving others alongside his brother Cesar Chavez and wife Dolores Huerta as co-founders of the United Farm Workers. Richard was known for designing the UFW's iconic eagle, which symbolizes hope and has been a powerful symbol in the fight for farm workers' rights for almost five decades. He not only fought for labor rights but also worked to improve the quality of life for countless farm workers. Richard was also a family man, and President Obama had the honor of meeting him and hearing the stories he shared during a visit to the Oval Office. President Obama emphasized that the struggle for a more perfect union and better lives for all workers requires a daily commitment. He offered his thoughts and prayers to Richard's family and loved ones, and took comfort in knowing that his passionate work will continue to inspire others.
