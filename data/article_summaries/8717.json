Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech at Coppin State University in Baltimore, Maryland, announcing the largest investment in financing for community-based climate projects in U.S. history. The $20 billion investment will fund tens of thousands of climate and clean energy projects across America, with a focus on communities that have been historically left out and left behind. Harris emphasized the need to address the climate crisis and its impact on communities, particularly poor communities, rural communities, Native communities, and communities of color. She also highlighted the importance of public-private partnerships and working with community banks to ensure the funds reach those who know the needs and potential of their communities. The investment aims to create jobs, lower emissions, improve public health, and support the clean energy transition. Harris concluded her speech by expressing hope and optimism for a better, cleaner, and healthier future.
