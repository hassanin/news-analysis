The ruling in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia is seen as a victory for Americans concerned about the crisis at the southern border. The court rejected the attempt of special interest groups to block a rule that discourages abuse of the asylum system. The rule encourages migrants to seek asylum in other countries they have traveled through before reaching the United States, and makes those who fail to do so ineligible for asylum. This aims to prevent opportunistic claims and unlawful immigration. The large number of opportunistic asylum claims has worsened the border crisis and delayed relief for genuine asylum seekers.
