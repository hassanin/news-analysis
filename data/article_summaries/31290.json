President Donald J. Trump has issued an order prohibiting the acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (Lattice) by China Venture Capital Fund Corporation Limited (CVCF), among others. CVCF is a Chinese corporation owned by Chinese state-owned entities that manages industrial investments and venture capital. The President made this decision under section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended by the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007. This act allows the President to suspend or prohibit certain acquisitions that result in foreign control of a U.S. business if there is credible evidence that the foreign interest exercising control might take action that threatens national security. The decision was made after considering factors such as the potential transfer of intellectual property, the Chinese government's involvement in the transaction, the importance of semiconductor supply chain integrity to the U.S. government, and the use of Lattice products by the U.S. government.
