The Obama Administration is urging Congress to pass a bipartisan compromise to keep student loan interest rates low. The plan, similar to one proposed by the President, will cut rates on all new loans this year and save the average undergraduate borrower $1,500 over the life of their loans. The plan allows borrowers to benefit from current low interest rates and guarantees that they can lock in these rates for the duration of their loans. In the future, fixed rates will be determined annually based on market conditions. The plan also rejects proposals to raise student rates in order to reduce the deficit. Nearly 11 million borrowers will see their interest rates decrease, with undergraduate borrowers seeing rates drop from 6.8% to 3.86% and graduate borrowers seeing rates drop from 6.8% to 5.41%. The plan also includes protections against high rates, capping interest rates at 8.25% for undergraduate loans, 9.5% for graduate loans, and 10.5% for PLUS loans. The compromise plan ensures the stability of federal student loan programs and allows for continued investment in college affordability programs like the Pell Grant program.
