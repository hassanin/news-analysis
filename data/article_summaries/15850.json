In a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney announced that President Obama had decided not to release any photographs of the deceased Osama bin Laden. Carney stated that the President made this decision because the release of graphic photos could incite violence and be used as propaganda. He also emphasized that there was no doubt that bin Laden was dead, and that DNA testing and facial analysis had confirmed his identity. Carney mentioned that the President had consulted with his national security team and that the majority opinion was in favor of not releasing the photos. He also stated that the President's top priority is the safety and security of American citizens. Carney did not provide any new operational details about the raid, stating that the administration had already provided a significant amount of information. He also mentioned that the President's approval rating had increased after the news of bin Laden's death, but acknowledged that the President's approval on the economy was low. Carney did not provide any information on whether the President had spoken to members of the team that carried out the raid or whether the President planned to meet with Prince William and Kate Middleton during his upcoming visit to the UK.
