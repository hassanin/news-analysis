The article discusses the importance of every American's right to vote and the need to protect and expand access to voting. It highlights the efforts made throughout history to ensure voting rights for all citizens, but also acknowledges the current threats to these rights. Over 380 bills have been introduced across the country that aim to restrict voting options such as early voting and voting by mail. The article emphasizes the need to protect the fundamental right to vote and mentions two important bills in Congress that would do so: the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The author, who has been asked by President Joe Biden to lead the Administration's efforts on voting rights, expresses their commitment to engaging with the American people, voting rights organizations, community organizations, and the private sector to strengthen and uplift voting rights nationwide. The ultimate goal is to ensure that voting is accessible to all voters and that every vote is counted through a free, fair, and transparent process.
