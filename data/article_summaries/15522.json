President Obama will be hosting the White House Tribal Nations Conference on December 2, 2011. This conference aims to provide leaders from the 565 federally recognized tribes with an opportunity to interact directly with the President and representatives from his Administration. Each tribe will be invited to send one representative. This will be the third conference of its kind for the Obama Administration and is part of the President's commitment to strengthening the relationship between the United States and Indian Country. More information about the conference will be released at a later date.
