The White House Office of the Vice President has released a new Public Service Announcement (PSA) on dating violence as part of the Vice President's 1 is 2 Many campaign. The PSA is targeted towards men between the ages of 16 to 24, as young women in this age group experience the highest rates of violence from someone they know. The PSA features professional athletes and other male role models who deliver the message that dating violence is unacceptable. It will air this summer on ESPN Networks, Fox Sports Networks, MLB Network, and NFL Network. The PSA includes appearances from Joe Torre, David Beckham, Eli Manning, Jeremy Lin, Evan Longoria, Jimmy Rollins, and Andy Katz. The Vice President and other Senior Administration officials were present for the rollout of the PSA.
