The Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, had two phone calls with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. They discussed the security situation in eastern Ukraine, where militants from Russia have taken control of parts of the border. Biden praised Poroshenko's commitment to implementing a peace plan and emphasized that de-escalation depends on Russia recognizing Poroshenko as the legitimate leader of Ukraine, stopping support for separatists, and ending the provision of arms across the border. Poroshenko offered amnesty or safe passage back to Russia for separatists if they disarmed and left the occupied buildings. Biden also expressed support for trilateral discussions between Ukraine, Russia, and OSCE Special Representative Heidi Tagliavini.
