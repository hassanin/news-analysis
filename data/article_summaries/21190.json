In this letter, President Barack Obama informs the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate about a recent operation conducted by French forces in Somalia. The operation aimed to rescue a French citizen held hostage by al-Shabaab. While the United States provided limited technical support, they did not directly participate in the assault on the compound. US combat aircraft briefly entered Somali airspace but did not use weapons. The President states that he directed US forces to support the operation in line with national security interests and his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief. The letter is provided to keep Congress informed, as required by the War Powers Resolution. The President expresses his appreciation for Congress' support in this action.
