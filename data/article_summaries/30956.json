The article discusses the healthcare debate surrounding pre-existing conditions. The author argues that liberals are exaggerating the issue by using images of patients being left without coverage. The GOP plan, according to the author, will ensure that everyone can receive the care they need. The article explains that the latest compromise between conservatives and centrists maintains the rule of guaranteed issue and community rating, but allows states to apply for waivers to pursue other regulatory relief. These waivers would require states to set up high-risk pools, which would subsidize coverage for older and sicker patients. The author argues that high-risk pools are a fairer and more equitable solution to the problem of pre-existing conditions, as they prevent artificially higher premiums for everyone else. The article concludes by stating that the GOP plan will ensure that everyone can access the care they need, despite the panic surrounding pre-existing conditions.
