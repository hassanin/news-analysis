Antibiotic Awareness Week is a time to recognize the importance of antibiotics in improving and sustaining our lives. Antibiotics have revolutionized the treatment of illnesses, saving lives and enabling various medical practices to be performed safely. However, it is also crucial to be aware of the dangers of misusing and overusing antibiotics, as this can lead to antibiotic resistance. Improper use of antibiotics has contributed to the rise of antibiotic-resistant germs, resulting in infections that are difficult to treat. Each year, millions of people in the United States are infected, and thousands are killed by antibiotic-resistant infections. Therefore, it is vital to use antibiotics appropriately and only when necessary.

The Biden administration is committed to addressing antibiotic resistance through a strong public health response. They are working towards the goals outlined in the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, focusing on evidence-based activities to slow the spread of antibiotic resistance and tracking antibiotic use across the country. The administration is implementing interventions to strengthen antibiotic stewardship, analyzing data, and addressing disparities in antibiotic prescribing and use. It is also examining how healthcare access and quality of care impact antibiotic-resistant infections.

Every American has a role to play in combating antibiotic resistance. Simple changes in how antibiotics are used, such as using the right antibiotic, correct dosage, and proper duration, can help prevent and control infections. During Antibiotic Awareness Week, the administration calls upon the scientific community, medical professionals, educators, businesses, industry leaders, and all Americans to promote responsible antibiotic use and raise awareness about the dangers of misuse and overuse.

In conclusion, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. proclaims November 18 to November 24, 2021, as Antibiotic Awareness Week. He urges everyone to observe this week by advocating for responsible antibiotic use and increasing awareness of the risks associated with their misuse and overuse.
