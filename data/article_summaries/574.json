The Biden Administration is taking additional measures to combat the Delta variant and increase vaccination rates in the United States. These efforts include imposing requirements for federal employees and contractors to attest to their vaccination status or wear masks and undergo regular testing. Similar standards may also be applied to federal contractors, and private sector employers are encouraged to follow suit. The Department of Defense will explore making COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for military personnel, particularly in areas with low vaccination rates. Small and medium-sized businesses will be reimbursed for providing paid leave to employees and their family members for vaccination purposes. The President is calling on state and local governments to offer $100 incentives for individuals who get vaccinated, as financial incentives have proven effective in increasing vaccination rates. School districts are urged to host pop-up vaccination clinics, and federal pharmacies will prioritize working with schools and colleges to facilitate vaccination clinics. The goal is to ensure easy access to vaccines for all students.
