The AM Forward initiative aims to lower costs for American families by improving the competitiveness of small and medium-sized manufacturers in the United States. The Biden Administration recognizes that making more products in America with secure and resilient supply chains is key to reducing the cost of goods and services. The plan to fight inflation includes investing over $200 billion in new manufacturing facilities and creating record-setting job growth. Companies are bringing manufacturing jobs back to the US, contributing to the revival of American industrial might. The Bipartisan Innovation Act (BIA) and AM Forward are part of this effort, supporting additive manufacturing and strengthening supply chains. The BIA establishes a Supply Chain Office at the Department of Commerce, invests in foundational technologies, and supports regional tech hubs. The goal is to make technological advancements accessible to small and large companies alike, increasing productivity and resilience while lowering costs. AM Forward is a voluntary compact between large manufacturers and their smaller US-based suppliers, promoting the adoption of additive manufacturing. The initiative includes commitments to purchase additively produced parts, train workers, provide technical assistance, and develop common standards. The Biden Administration has also identified federal programs to support small and medium-sized manufacturers in adopting additive capabilities and increasing their competitiveness.
