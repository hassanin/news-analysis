President Obama has sent a message to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Somalia will continue beyond its anniversary date. The President highlights the deteriorating security situation, ongoing violence, acts of piracy and armed robbery off the coast of Somalia, and violations of the Somalia arms embargo as reasons for the continuation of the national emergency. The President believes that these issues pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
