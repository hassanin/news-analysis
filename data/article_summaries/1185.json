President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has issued an Executive Order addressing the situation in northern Ethiopia. The region has been marked by activities that threaten the peace, security, and stability of Ethiopia and the greater Horn of Africa region. The violent conflict in northern Ethiopia has led to a widespread humanitarian crisis, leaving millions of people in need of assistance and pushing the region towards famine. President Biden has declared a national emergency and authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to impose sanctions on individuals and entities responsible for actions that threaten peace, security, or stability in Ethiopia. These actions include corruption, human rights violations, blocking humanitarian supplies, targeting civilians, and attacking UN or African Union personnel. The Executive Order aims to address the crisis and support efforts towards a ceasefire and peace process, as well as protect democratic processes and institutions in Ethiopia.
