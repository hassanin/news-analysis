This article discusses a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Donald Trump regarding the reform of developing-country status in the World Trade Organization (WTO). The memo argues that the current dichotomy between developed and developing countries in the WTO allows some countries to gain unfair advantages in international trade. It states that many countries that claim developing-country status, such as China, have economic indicators that contradict this designation. The memo calls for reforms in the WTO to prevent self-declared developing countries from availing themselves of unwarranted benefits. If substantial progress is not made within 90 days, the United States may no longer treat certain WTO members as developing countries and may not support their membership in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The USTR will consult with relevant committees and consider various factors before taking such action. The USTR will also publish a list of self-declared developing countries that are believed to be inappropriately seeking the benefits of developing-country flexibilities.
