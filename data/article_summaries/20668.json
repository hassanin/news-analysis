The United States strongly condemns the use of violence against protesters in Egypt and extends condolences to the families of those who have been killed and injured. The US has repeatedly called on the Egyptian military and security forces to show restraint and for the government to respect the universal rights of its citizens. Violence will only make it more difficult for Egypt to achieve stability and democracy, going against the interim government's pledge to pursue reconciliation. The US also opposes a return to a State of Emergency law and calls on the government to respect basic human rights such as freedom of peaceful assembly and due process. The US urges the government and all parties in Egypt to refrain from violence and resolve their differences peacefully.
