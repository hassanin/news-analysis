Second Lady Karen Pence recently traveled to Orlando, Florida where she visited the Florida Hospital Cancer Institute and Nemours Children’s Hospital. At the Florida Hospital Cancer Institute, she met with staff involved in the Integrative & Creative Arts Therapies program, which offers music and art therapy services to oncology patients. Mrs. Pence participated in creating artwork with the patients. She then traveled to Nemours Children’s Hospital, where she observed a music therapy session and participated in a roundtable discussion with music therapists, a patient's family, and hospital staff. Mrs. Pence's chosen initiative is art therapy, which she calls "Art Therapy: Healing with the HeART." Art therapy is an integrative mental health and human services profession that uses art-making and creative processes to enrich the lives of individuals, families, and communities. Professional art therapists facilitate art therapy using psychological and counseling theories and techniques. For more information about the art therapy profession, visit arttherapy.org.
