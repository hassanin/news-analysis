The United States is committed to promoting transparency and accountability in the extractive industries through its participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The EITI is a global standard that aims to ensure the open and accountable management of extractive industry resources. With 51 countries implementing the standard, including the United States, the EITI promotes the disclosure of extractive industry revenues paid by companies and received by governments. This transparency helps improve governance, attract investment, and combat corruption and mismanagement in the extractives sector. The United States has supported the EITI by sitting on its international Board, making financial contributions, and promoting its recognition in multilateral fora. The U.S. government has also provided targeted bilateral support and assistance to strengthen EITI implementation at the country level. Domestically, the United States has formed a Federal Advisory Committee to improve transparency in the U.S. extractives industry, released two U.S. Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (USEITI) Reports, and launched an interactive data portal to enhance citizen understanding of extractive industries. Several U.S. states and indigenous tribes have voluntarily participated in the USEITI process, further expanding public access to local-level natural resource data. Overall, the United States believes that the EITI can contribute to citizen understanding of the extractives industry and ensure a fair return for the American people from the use of public resources.
