President Obama is urging Congress to pass comprehensive legislation to reform the credit card industry. He believes that credit card contracts have been deceptive and complicated, leading consumers to pay more than expected. Americans pay around $15 billion in penalty fees each year. The President calls for strong consumer protections, including banning unfair rate increases and abusive fees and penalties. He also emphasizes the need for clear and transparent language in credit card forms and statements. Additionally, he wants to ensure that consumers can shop for a credit card without being taken advantage of, by making contract terms easily accessible and promoting comparison shopping. Lastly, he emphasizes the need for accountability, with increased monitoring, enforcement, and penalties for violations of the law. The President supports the legislative efforts in both the House and the Senate, which include banning unfair rate increases, preventing unfair fees and interest rate charges, promoting market transparency, and providing protections for students and young people.
