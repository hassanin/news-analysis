The article discusses a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Barack Obama in 2011. The memorandum declares a national emergency in response to the significant threat posed by transnational criminal organizations to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. These criminal organizations have become increasingly sophisticated and dangerous, taking advantage of globalization and diversifying their activities. They corrupt governments, undermine democratic institutions, distort legitimate markets, engage in cybercrime, steal intellectual property, engage in drug trafficking, support dangerous individuals involved in arms smuggling and human smuggling, and have growing ties to terrorists.

To address this growing threat, the Executive Order issued by President Obama targets these transnational criminal organizations and their support networks by blocking their property and interests in property. The order also provides criteria for further blocking persons determined to be associated with these organizations. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, is delegated the authority to take necessary actions to carry out the order's purposes. All executive agencies of the United States Government are directed to take appropriate measures to implement the provisions of the order.
