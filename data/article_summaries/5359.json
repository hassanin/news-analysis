President Joe Biden has proclaimed September 5-11, 2021, as National Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Week. He recognizes the vital role that HBCUs play in molding Black leaders and helping America reach its full potential. HBCUs have been engines of opportunity for generations, fostering excellence and contributing to the progress of the nation. Despite progress, systemic racism persists in various aspects of society, such as education, labor, healthcare, and criminal justice. HBCUs have risen to the occasion, serving their students and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic and advocating for justice and equality. President Biden's administration is committed to supporting HBCUs and promoting equity and racial justice. They have proposed increased funding for HBCUs and established the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Opportunity, and Excellence through HBCUs. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to observe HBCU Week and acknowledge the contributions of these institutions and their alumni to the country.
