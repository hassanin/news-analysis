The United States is expressing deep concern over the additional charges facing Kian Tajbakhsh, an Iranian-American scholar who has been detained in Iran since July 9, 2009. The US believes the charges against Tajbakhsh are baseless and that his original sentence on October 20 was unjust. The US is calling on Iran to release Tajbakhsh and to respect the human rights of its citizens. The US also states that Iran cannot earn the respect of the international community when it violates universal rights and imprisons innocent people.
