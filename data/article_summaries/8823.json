Today, Jennifer Klein and Julie Chavez Rodriguez, White House officials, held a meeting with state legislative leaders from states that have banned abortion. The participants discussed efforts to protect access to reproductive health care in these states where reproductive rights are under attack. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Republican elected officials in many states have enforced abortion bans, including states with pre-Roe laws. Over a dozen states currently have abortion bans in effect, some with extreme punishments for health care providers. The meeting focused on anticipated attacks on reproductive health care access in upcoming legislative sessions and affirmative policies to support populations affected by these bans. The White House officials expressed gratitude for the leaders' efforts and partnership in protecting access to reproductive health care and reiterated the President's commitment to ensuring nationwide access, including by prioritizing a bill to codify Roe into law in the next Congress.
