The Obama-Biden Administration implemented the DACA policy in 2012, allowing young immigrants to stay and work in the US. However, after nine years, Congress still hasn't provided a path to citizenship for these individuals. A recent court ruling has caused uncertainty for hundreds of thousands of young immigrants. The Department of Justice plans to appeal the decision, and the Department of Homeland Security will propose a rule on DACA soon. However, only Congress can grant a permanent solution and path to citizenship for Dreamers. The American Dream and Promise Act is being urged to be passed urgently to provide security for these individuals.
