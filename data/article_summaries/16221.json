In a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney discussed several topics. He mentioned that thanks to the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies must spend at least 80 percent of premium dollars on healthcare and not overhead costs. He also highlighted a new report by the Kaiser Family Foundation that found that 15.8 million Americans will receive $1.3 billion in rebates due to the President’s health care law. Additionally, Carney mentioned that the President met with his national security team to review the threat picture as the anniversary of the bin Laden takedown approached. At the time, there was no credible information of terrorist organizations plotting attacks in the US, but the President directed his team to continue taking measures to protect the American people. Carney also addressed questions about the Secret Service investigation into agents and prostitutes, the student loan issue, and the White House’s position on Iran and the Sudan.
