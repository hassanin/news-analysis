On World Press Freedom Day, the White House acknowledges and appreciates the journalists around the world who play a crucial role in upholding democracy and holding authorities accountable. These journalists work tirelessly to ensure that public debates on important issues can take place freely and openly. However, many journalists face imprisonment and even risk their lives for their work, particularly in countries such as China, Iran, and Venezuela. The United States calls for the release of those imprisoned for exercising their freedom of expression, while also urging governments to create an environment in which journalists can work without fear. The statement also pays tribute to the journalists, including Americans, who have sacrificed their lives or freedom to report on the experiences of those living in war-torn regions. The White House pledges to continue efforts to secure the release of journalists like Austin Tice, who remain in captivity. It emphasizes that journalists deserve gratitude for their risks and sacrifices, as they contribute to the development of more peaceful, accountable, innovative, and successful societies.
