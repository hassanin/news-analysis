President Joe Biden has vetoed a resolution that sought to disapprove the rule entitled "Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards." The rule, implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency, aimed to further reduce the air quality impacts of heavy-duty engines, including their emissions standards, test procedures, and other requirements. The rule was expected to cut pollution, improve public health, and promote environmental justice across the country. By preventing premature deaths, childhood asthma cases, and missed school days, the rule would have provided significant health benefits to communities. However, the resolution aimed to weaken emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles and engines, which are major sources of pollutants that pose risks to public health. President Biden vetoed the resolution, highlighting the $36 billion in societal benefits that would be lost and the opportunity to address the pressing crisis of our time by leading in environmental protection.
