On November 2, 2020, President Donald Trump issued an executive order on education. The purpose of the order is to ensure that the rising generation understands the history and principles of the founding of the United States in 1776, in order to form a more perfect Union. The order acknowledges that recent polemics have vilified the Founders and the founding of the country, resulting in a distorted view of American history. The order emphasizes the need for a shared identity rooted in the founding principles and the importance of patriotic education. It establishes the President's Advisory 1776 Commission, which is tasked with producing a report on the core principles of the American founding, advising on the celebration of the 250th anniversary of American Independence, and promoting patriotic education. The order also prioritizes the American founding in available federal resources and emphasizes the celebration of Constitution Day.
