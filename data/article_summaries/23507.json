On World AIDS Day, the President emphasizes the need to stand with those affected by HIV/AIDS, remember those who have passed away, and renew the commitment to ending the pandemic. The United States is implementing a National HIV/AIDS Strategy, focusing on high-risk communities such as gay men, Latinos, and African Americans. Efforts include comprehensive prevention and care, HIV testing, and ensuring access to treatment through the Affordable Care Act. The President announces that the administration is on track to meet treatment and prevention targets, with over 5 million people currently receiving AIDS medication and a goal of treating 6 million by the end of 2013. Additionally, over 700,000 HIV-positive pregnant women have been provided with antiretroviral drugs to prevent transmission to their children. The President recognizes the support of other countries and the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria in achieving these goals. The statement concludes by urging remembrance of lives lost, celebrating progress made, and renewing the commitment to an AIDS-free generation.
