The United States strongly condemns the actions of the Belarusian government in undermining the democratic process and using excessive force against political activists, journalists, and civil society representatives. The US calls for the immediate release of all detained presidential candidates and protestors. The US does not consider the results of the presidential election announced by the Belarusian Central Election Commission to be legitimate, as the political environment leading up to the elections did not result in a free and fair outcome or a transparent vote count. There are concerns about the disruption of independent internet media and the US urges the Belarusian government to protect its citizens' right to free media. The further development of relations between the US and Belarus is contingent upon the Belarusian government's respect for human rights and the democratic process, and the recent actions taken by the government are seen as a step backwards in this regard.
