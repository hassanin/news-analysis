President Donald J. Trump's Administration has announced a grant of $3.7 billion to help rebuild Puerto Rico's water and wastewater treatment plants, pumping stations, dams, and reservoirs. This funding represents the 90% Federal share of the $4.1 billion fixed cost estimate for facilities operated by Puerto Rico's Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA). This is one of the largest Public Assistance grants in the history of FEMA. In addition to this, FEMA has also granted $9.6 billion for electrical infrastructure and $2 billion for education facilities in Puerto Rico. These grants exceed the total Public Assistance funding in any single federally-declared disaster other than Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy. The funding will be used to repair and replace transmission and distribution lines, electrical substations, power generation systems, office buildings, and make other grid improvements. The grant for education facilities will focus on restoring school buildings and educational facilities across the island. The funding is provided under FEMA's Public Assistance Alternative Procedures, allowing Puerto Rican officials to work with FEMA to determine the best way to meet their recovery needs. With this grant, the Trump Administration will have obligated over $40 billion for Puerto Rico's recovery from Hurricane Maria.
