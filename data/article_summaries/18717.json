The American Bar Association (ABA) has given Chief Judge Merrick Garland its highest rating, unanimously declaring him well-qualified for a position on the United States Supreme Court. The ABA, a nonpartisan legal organization, joins other respected voices in affirming Garland's judicial excellence. The statement also criticizes the Senate for not fulfilling its constitutional responsibility to consider Garland's nomination, noting that the nomination has been pending for 97 days, well beyond the average confirmation time of 67 days. The White House calls on the Senate to do its job and give Garland's nomination proper consideration.
