On March 15, 1995, President Biden declared a national emergency in response to the actions and policies of the Government of Iran, which were deemed to be a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. This national emergency has been renewed annually and is set to continue beyond March 15, 2022. The Government of Iran's activities, including the proliferation of missiles, support for terrorist groups, and regional aggression, are seen as an ongoing threat. This renewal is separate from the emergency declared in 1979 in connection with the hostage crisis. The notice of this renewal will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
