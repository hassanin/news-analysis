On January 23, 2018, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation regarding the implementation of safeguard measures on imports of large residential washers and certain washer parts. The proclamation was based on a report by the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) that found these imports to be causing serious injury to domestic industries. The safeguard measures include the imposition of a tariff-rate quota on imports of washers and covered washer parts for a period of three years, with annual reductions in rates of duty. Imports from Canada are excluded from these measures, while imports from Mexico are included. The proclamation also includes provisions for developing countries that are members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and sets out guidelines for potential modifications or terminations of the safeguard measures. The modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) outlined in the proclamation will come into effect on February 7, 2018, and will remain in effect for the specified period unless earlier reduced, modified, or terminated.
