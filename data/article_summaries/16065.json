Italy had a nuclear power research program in the 1960s to mid-1980s, but in 1987, it announced the end of its nuclear energy program. Italy signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1979, reaffirming its commitment to be nuclear weapons-free. The Società Gestione Impianti Nucleari (SOGIN) was created in 2001 to decommission and clean up nuclear facilities. At the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit, Italy announced its partnership with the United States to eliminate its excess highly enriched uranium (HEU) and plutonium. SOGIN has been working with the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration’s Global Threat Reduction Initiative to identify materials for transfer to the United States for disposition. Italy and the United States will continue to work together to complete the removal of this material by the Nuclear Security Summit in 2014.
