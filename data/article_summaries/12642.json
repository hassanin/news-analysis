President Obama has announced the launch of his Administration's Rural Tour, in which top officials will travel across the country to hold discussions on how to strengthen rural America. The tour will focus on issues such as rural broadband, economic development, infrastructure, education, energy, natural resources, and agriculture. The goal is to listen to the needs and concerns of rural communities and report back to the President on how the Administration can support them. The tour will involve multiple Cabinet secretaries and will include events in various states, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Virginia, and Louisiana.
