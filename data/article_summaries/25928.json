President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed May 2020 as National Mental Health Awareness Month. He acknowledges that the coronavirus pandemic has caused not only physical suffering but also mental and emotional hardship. The stress and worry over the health and safety of loved ones, forced isolation, and financial distress can lead to anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and even suicide. The President emphasizes the importance of fighting the stigmas surrounding mental illness and empowering those affected to seek care. He highlights the expansion of telehealth services to provide easier access to mental health treatments and resources. The President also mentions funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs to support veterans' mental health, as well as crisis counseling and training services through the Stafford Act. He addresses the issue of suicide prevention and the establishment of a national three-digit number for suicide prevention. The President mentions the PREVENTS initiative, aimed at preventing veteran suicide, and the #MoreThanEverBefore campaign to encourage reaching out to veterans in need. The President calls upon all Americans to support those suffering from mental illnesses, raise awareness, and commit to innovative prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.
