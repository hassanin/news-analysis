The article discusses the U.S.-Philippines Partnership for Growth (PFG), a high-level initiative focused on economic growth in countries committed to good governance. The PFG aims to address the most significant constraints to growth in the Philippines, which include governance and inability to capture revenue. The initiative leverages the resources and tools of partners, especially the private sector, to increase the effectiveness of policies and institutions necessary for development. The U.S. government provides funding of over $800 million over five years to support PFG projects. The U.S.-Philippines Joint Country Action Plan prioritizes creating a more transparent and predictable legal and regulatory regime, fostering a more open and competitive business environment, strengthening the rule of law, and supporting fiscal stability through better revenue and expenditure management. The Philippine government has made significant progress in implementing policy and institutional reforms, resulting in improvements in GDP growth, competitiveness, tax revenues, and sovereign debt ranking. The goal is to ensure that the growth generated is inclusive and sustainable.
