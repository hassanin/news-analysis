On November 14, 1994, the President declared a national emergency regarding the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and their means of delivery. This declaration has been amended multiple times to address the ongoing threat of weapons of mass destruction. The national emergency, which was set to expire on November 14, 2023, is now being extended for another year. This decision is based on the continued unusual and extraordinary threat posed by the proliferation of these weapons. The notice of this extension will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress. This action was taken by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on November 1, 2023.
