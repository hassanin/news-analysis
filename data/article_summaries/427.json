In a speech delivered in the State Dining Room, President Biden discussed his administration's efforts to promote fair competition in the economy. He highlighted the success of the American Rescue Plan in bringing the economy back from the pandemic-induced crisis and stated that the country is now on track for the highest economic growth in 40 years. He emphasized the importance of fair competition in capitalism and expressed concern over the lack of competition and increasing concentration in various sectors, such as agriculture, technology, and pharmaceuticals. The President mentioned the impact of this lack of competition on consumer prices, wages, and the ability of new businesses to enter the market. He announced that he would be signing an executive order to promote competition and outlined three specific actions: allowing the importation of prescription drugs from Canada, making hearing aids available over the counter, and addressing non-compete agreements that limit workers' mobility and bargaining power. President Biden called for the enforcement of antitrust laws and the elimination of unnecessary occupational licensing requirements. He concluded by stressing the importance of competition in driving economic growth and expressing optimism about the future. After the speech, President Biden answered questions from reporters about his call with President Putin and the issue of ransomware attacks originating from Russia.
