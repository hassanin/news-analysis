Carney stated that NATO was discussing options, including military options, and that ground troops were not a top priority at the moment.

He also mentioned discussions about arming rebels and the need for a representative government in Libya. On the budget negotiations, Carney stated that conversations were ongoing at the staff level and that progress was being made. He mentioned the importance of finding common ground and avoiding a government shutdown.
