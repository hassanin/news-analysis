President Donald J. Trump recently spoke at the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual convention in Nashville, Tennessee. He addressed the challenges faced by rural America, including slow employment growth, high poverty rates, and lack of broadband access. In response, he signed two Presidential Orders to expand access to broadband internet in rural areas. The first order instructs the Department of Interior to dedicate assets for rural broadband installation, while the second order streamlines the installation process by requiring standardized forms and contracts for installing antennas on federal buildings. Trump expressed his support for farmers and promised to continue working towards rural prosperity.
