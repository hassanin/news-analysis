President Biden will be discussing his vision for another American moonshot: ending cancer. He believes that when the nation comes together around ideas like fighting cancer, anything is possible. The President will announce new actions that the Biden-Harris Administration is taking, including the appointment of Dr. Renee Wegrzyn as the inaugural director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H). ARPA-H will support programs and projects to prevent, detect, and treat complex diseases such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, and cancer. 

Additionally, President Biden will sign an executive order establishing the Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Initiative to ensure that cutting-edge biotechnologies and innovations will be developed and manufactured in America. This initiative aims to save lives, create jobs, strengthen supply chains, and lower prices for American families. It also addresses the reliance on foreign materials for bioproduction and the off-shoring of critical industries.

The Cancer Cabinet, formed by the President and First Lady, has made progress towards ending cancer as we know it. They have unveiled priority actions to close the screening gap, address environmental exposure, decrease the impact of preventable cancers, bring cutting-edge research to patients, and support patients and caregivers. The Cancer Cabinet will announce the progress made in these areas.
