The US government has imposed sanctions on several companies and individuals for their involvement in activities related to Iran's nuclear program, support for terrorism, or aiding Iran's evasion of international sanctions. These measures are part of the US effort to maintain pressure on Iran. The US remains committed to working with its P5+1 partners to achieve a long-term, comprehensive solution that ensures Iran's nuclear program is exclusively peaceful. These actions are in line with the commitments made under the Joint Plan of Action, which provided limited relief of certain sanctions in exchange for Iran's steps to halt and roll back its nuclear program.
