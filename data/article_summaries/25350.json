President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation declaring March 18-24, 2018, as Vocational-Technical Education Week. This proclamation highlights the important role that vocational and technical education plays in preparing Americans for careers in critical sectors such as manufacturing, construction, and technology. The proclamation emphasizes the need for skilled workers to fill the millions of unfilled jobs in these industries and calls for increased access to affordable and high-quality education that leads to full-time work and long-term careers. The proclamation also calls on Congress to reauthorize and improve the Perkins Career and Technical Education program and reform the Federal Work-Study program. The goal is to train the workforce of today for the challenges and developments of tomorrow. The proclamation concludes by urging public officials, educators, librarians, and all Americans to observe Vocational-Technical Education Week with appropriate ceremonies and activities to highlight the benefits of vocational-technical education.
