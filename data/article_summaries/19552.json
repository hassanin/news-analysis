The United States, along with Burma, Japan, Denmark, and the International Labor Organization (ILO), has launched the Initiative to Promote Fundamental Labor Rights and Practices in Myanmar. The goal of this initiative is to modernize Burma's labor code, improve compliance with international labor standards, and foster dialogue between the government, business, labor, and civil society. The initiative will use a multilateral, multi-stakeholder approach to strengthen labor reform, enforcement, transparency, and domestic stakeholder consultations. The next steps include holding a stakeholder forum in Burma in early 2015 to provide input on the development of a labor reform plan and drafting the plan through the Labor Law Reform Cluster. The U.S. Department of Labor is providing funding to the ILO to bring on board a labor law expert to assist in developing the reform plan over the next six months. The initiative aims to promote fundamental labor rights, responsible business practices, and sustainable growth and development in Burma.
