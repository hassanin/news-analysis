Julie Chavez Rodriguez and Ambassador Susan Rice met with five Black Speakers of the House from state legislatures, including Speaker Chris Welch, Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross, Speaker Adrienne Jones, Speaker Joe Tate, and Speaker Carl Heastie. The meeting focused on the collaboration between the Biden-Harris Administration and state leaders in delivering for working families. The priorities discussed included expanding economic opportunity, advancing voting rights, gun violence prevention, criminal justice reform, and reproductive rights. The White House officials commended the Speakers for their leadership and highlighted the significant federal legislation that has been passed under President Biden, such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the American Rescue Plan Act. They emphasized the importance of federal-state partnership in implementing these provisions and the role of state leadership in advancing policies that Congress may not address.
