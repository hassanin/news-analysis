The White House has announced a new public-private partnership called the IT Training and Certification Partnership. This partnership will enable thousands of service members to earn industry-recognized information technology (IT) certifications before they transition from military service. The Administration will also announce a new grant program through the Department of Health and Human Services to help veterans with health care experience pursue professional nursing careers. The event will also feature roundtables to discuss initiatives to streamline the ability of service members and veterans to earn civilian certifications and licenses required for high-demand jobs in emergency medical services, healthcare, and transportation sectors. This announcement builds upon previous partnerships with the manufacturing sector and the establishment of the Department of Defense's Military Credentialing and Licensing Task Force. Industry leaders, such as Cisco, Microsoft, Oracle, and HP, have committed support to this initiative by providing training programs, exam vouchers, and job opportunities for veterans.
