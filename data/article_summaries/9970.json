The White House Office of the Press Secretary has announced the second round of grants awarded as part of the POWER Initiative's "POWER 2016" funding opportunity. These grants, totaling nearly $28 million, will support 42 economic and workforce development projects in thirteen states that are focused on building a strong economic future in coal communities. The projects target various industries such as manufacturing, information technology, agriculture, housing, and tourism and recreation. The POWER Initiative is a collaborative effort involving ten federal agencies that aims to assist communities and workers affected by job losses in the coal industry. The grants are part of President Obama's broader POWER+ Plan and are administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission and the U.S. Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration.
