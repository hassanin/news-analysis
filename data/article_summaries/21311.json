On Blind Americans Equality Day, the President acknowledges the achievements of blind and visually impaired Americans and reaffirms the commitment to advancing their social and economic integration. The administration has taken steps to improve accessibility for people with disabilities, such as signing the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act and working on compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The 75th anniversary of the Randolph-Sheppard Act is also recognized for providing job opportunities for blind Americans. The Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act, signed in January, requires electric and hybrid vehicles to make sounds to alert pedestrians, benefiting blind and visually impaired individuals. October 15 is recognized as "White Cane Safety Day" to honor the contributions of blind and visually impaired Americans. The President calls upon public officials, business and community leaders, educators, and Americans across the country to observe Blind Americans Equality Day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
