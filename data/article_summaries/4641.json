President Lyndon B. Johnson established community health centers over 50 years ago to provide affordable primary health care to underserved Americans. These health centers continue to play a vital role in the public health system, serving over 30 million people annually. However, many Americans still struggle to access necessary medical services, including Medicaid expansion, prescription drugs, mental health services, and preventive screenings. Health centers, funded by the federal government, address these challenges by providing medical services to communities of color, rural communities, and individuals living in poverty. They are governed by patient-majority boards, ensuring decisions are informed by those being served. The Biden administration has invested billions of dollars to strengthen the health center network, including funds from the American Rescue Plan. The administration aims to double the size of the Health Center Program and ensure access to affordable health care for all Americans. National Health Center Week is celebrated to honor the contributions of health centers and their staff in creating a stronger, healthier, and more equitable health system.
