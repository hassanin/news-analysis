The article discusses President Obama's proposals to improve and modernize the unemployment insurance system in the United States. The President's plan includes three core elements: protecting workers with wage insurance, strengthening unemployment insurance (UI), and making it easier for workers to retool and retrain. 

Under the wage insurance plan, workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own would receive replacement wages up to $10,000 over two years, replacing half of their lost wages. This would help experienced workers transition into new jobs and avoid long-term unemployment.

The plan also aims to address holes in the UI system by expanding coverage to part-time, low-income, and intermittent workers, as well as workers who leave work for compelling family reasons. It would also ensure that states provide a minimum of 26 weeks of coverage.

To make it easier for workers to retool and retrain, the plan includes incentives for companies to avoid layoffs through work-sharing and provides support for retraining programs. It also expands career counseling services for the long-term unemployed, discouraged workers, and part-time workers.

Overall, these proposals aim to strengthen the safety net and modernize the UI system to better support workers and their families during times of economic insecurity.
