President Obama commends the House of Representatives for voting in favor of trade deals that will benefit American workers and businesses. He emphasizes that his main priority is to grow the economy and create opportunities for hardworking Americans. The President believes that new trade agreements are necessary to encourage growth and job creation in the evolving 21st century economy. These agreements will level the playing field for American workers, open new markets for businesses, and ensure that global trade rules are set by the United States. The President argues that opposing these agreements only serves to maintain the status quo and hinder American workers' success. He states that Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) will protect workers' rights, the environment, and the internet while also cracking down on countries that violate trade rules. However, the President emphasizes the need for support to American workers affected by trade, urging the House to pass Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) to provide vital support to workers and their communities. President Obama concludes by thanking Representatives who have worked together to support American workers and urges the House to pass TAA so that workers and businesses can continue to thrive in the global economy.
