The White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) has released final guidance for federal agencies on how to consider the impacts of their actions on climate change in their National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reviews. The guidance is intended to help agencies make informed decisions about the impacts of climate change associated with their actions. It advises agencies to quantify greenhouse gas emissions whenever possible, encourages them to consider alternatives that would make affected communities more resilient to climate change, and reminds them to use existing information and science when assessing proposed actions. This guidance builds off of previous drafts and reflects feedback received from various stakeholders. The release of this guidance is part of the Administration's ongoing efforts to address climate change and improve the transparency, involvement of the public, and efficiency of environmental reviews.
