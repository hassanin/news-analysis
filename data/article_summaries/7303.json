On May 15, 2019, President Biden declared a national emergency in response to the threat posed by the unrestricted acquisition and use of certain information and communications technology and services transactions by foreign adversaries. This unrestricted acquisition or use enhances the ability of these adversaries to exploit vulnerabilities in information and communications technology or services, which could have catastrophic effects on the United States' national security, foreign policy, and economy. As a result, President Biden has decided to continue the national emergency beyond May 15, 2022, for one year, in order to secure the information and communications technology and services supply chain. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
