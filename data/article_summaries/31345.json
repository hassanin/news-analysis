High-ranking officials from the United States and China have engaged in intense and productive negotiations over the economic relationship between the two countries. The talks covered various issues, including technology transfer, intellectual property rights, trade barriers, cyber-theft, market-distorting forces, and reducing the trade deficit. Both sides showed willingness to engage and reached meaningful commitments, but more work needs to be done. President Trump has reiterated that the 90-day process agreed to in Buenos Aires represents a hard deadline and that tariffs will increase unless a satisfactory outcome is reached by March 1, 2019. Further talks are expected.
