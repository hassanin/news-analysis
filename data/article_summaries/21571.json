The article is a statement by the White House Press Secretary on the Republican budget proposal for FY2012. The President agrees that reducing the long-term deficit is important, but disagrees with the approach of the Republican plan. The President believes that any plan to reduce the deficit should reflect fairness and shared sacrifice, but the Republican plan cuts taxes for the wealthy and places a greater burden on seniors, families with disabilities, workers without healthcare coverage, and students relying on Pell grants. The President believes there is a more balanced way to achieve prosperity and calls for finding common ground between Democrats and Republicans.
