Last week, officials from the Biden-Harris Administration participated in a workshop on incorporating climate change into macroeconomic modeling. The workshop was organized by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and aimed to explore how current macroeconomic models account for climate change and identify avenues for connecting different modeling communities. The workshop included representatives from various sectors, including scholars, policymakers, and business leaders. The President has set an ambitious goal of transitioning to a net-zero economy by 2050, and to support this effort, the Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial Risk called on the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to improve the representation of climate risks in the Federal Budget. CEA, OMB, and an Interagency Technical Working Group are working together to develop new tools and models to better account for the economic impacts of climate change and the energy transition. This includes updating the accounting of climate risks in the Long-Term Budget Outlook. The White House is also fostering a global community of practice by convening private sector macroeconomic forecasters and representatives of partner governments and multilateral institutions. These initiatives aim to build a global knowledge base and develop an economic toolkit to facilitate the transition to a net-zero economy.
