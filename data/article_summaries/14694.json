In this statement from June 13, 2014, President Obama discusses the situation in Iraq. He mentions the significant gains made by the terrorist organization ISIL (also known as ISIS) and the inability of Iraqi security forces to defend against them. He emphasizes that while the threat is not new, additional support is needed to break the momentum of extremist groups and bolster the capabilities of Iraqi security forces. However, he also states that this is not solely a military challenge and that political efforts by Iraq's leaders to set aside sectarian differences and promote stability are crucial. The President mentions the responsibility of Iraq's neighbors to support this process and emphasizes the need for political outcomes to resolve differences peacefully. He also addresses the spillover of the Syrian civil war into Iraq and the need for a long-term international effort to rebuild countries and communities affected by sectarian war. The President mentions ongoing consultations with foreign countries to determine their support for the international effort. He expresses concern about the disruption of oil supplies but notes that major disruptions have not been seen yet. The President concludes by stating that any military action will be based on a political plan by the Iraqis and emphasizes the importance of long-term stability and prosperity for the country.
