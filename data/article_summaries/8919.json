Vaccination against COVID-19 is also encouraged to protect farmers and farmworkers. The proclamation recognizes the importance of supporting the well-being of farmers and farmworkers as they contribute to the prosperity of rural America and beyond. The Biden Administration is committed to creating a safe and healthy environment for every farmer, rancher, and farmworker, ensuring the nation's leadership in agricultural production and innovation, and securing the food supply and economy. The proclamation calls upon the people of the United States to reaffirm their dedication to farm safety and health and express appreciation and gratitude to farmers and ranchers for their vital contributions.
