The White House has launched the "Healthy Communities Challenge" to help uninsured Americans gain coverage through the Affordable Care Act. The challenge aims to engage communities with high percentages of uninsured individuals and encourage them to build outreach efforts to reach these individuals. At the end of the open enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services will compare the number of new signups in each participating community to the estimated number of eligible uninsured individuals to determine the most successful community. The winning community will receive a visit from President Obama. Chicago is one of the communities participating in the challenge. The article also provides information on health insurance coverage in Illinois, including the number of people covered through the Health Insurance Exchange and the affordability of plans. It emphasizes the importance of tax credits and the ability to choose from multiple health plan options. While progress has been made in reducing the uninsured rate, there is still work to be done in covering the uninsured population in Illinois and Chicago.
