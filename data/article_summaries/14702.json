On May 15, 2009, President Obama signed a disaster declaration for the state of Tennessee due to severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred on April 10, 2009. The declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in Benton, McMinn, Rutherford, and Sequatchie Counties. Federal funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. Terry L. Quarles has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made if requested by the state and further damage assessments warrant it. For more information, contact FEMA at (202) 646-4600.
