The President of the United States and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom have reaffirmed their commitment to working together for a more peaceful and prosperous future. They have revitalized the Atlantic Charter, which builds on commitments made eighty years ago and affirms their ongoing commitment to defending democratic values and institutions. The leaders pledge to work closely with partners who share these values and counter efforts to undermine alliances and institutions. The key points of the charter include defending democracy and open societies, strengthening international cooperation, upholding principles of sovereignty and peaceful dispute resolution, harnessing science and technology for security and economic development, maintaining collective security and countering modern threats, building a fair and sustainable global economy, prioritizing action on climate change and biodiversity, and strengthening global health defenses.
