President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has authorized the provision of up to $100 million in assistance to address urgent refugee and migration needs stemming from the situation in Afghanistan. This assistance will be provided through the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund and may be given on a bilateral or multilateral basis, including through contributions to international organizations and funding to nongovernmental organizations, governments, and US departments and agencies. This determination supersedes a previous presidential determination from June 11, 2021. The Secretary of State has been directed to submit this determination to Congress, along with a justification, and to publish it in the Federal Register.
