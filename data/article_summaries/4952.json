A new report from the Council of Economic Advisers and Office of Management and Budget highlights the rising costs of necessities for American families over the past three decades. While some services and goods have become cheaper, others, such as healthcare, prescription drugs, childcare, and education, have increased significantly, often faster than incomes. This, combined with income inequality, has put low- and middle-income families at greater risk. The Biden Administration's Build Back Better economic agenda aims to address these cost pressures through proposed investments. Families with young children would benefit from expanded child tax credits, universal preschool, improved childcare quality, and reduced out-of-pocket costs. Additionally, proposals to lower prescription drug costs, add dental and vision benefits to Medicare, and expand access to home- and community-based care through Medicaid would particularly help households with elderly members. These policy proposals, along with others from President Biden, aim to ensure that families can afford necessary expenses and share in economic prosperity.
