The article is a letter from President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate. In the letter, President Obama declares a national emergency to deal with the threat of nuclear proliferation posed by the accumulation of weapons-usable fissile material in Russia. He explains that the United States and Russia have agreements in place to convert highly enriched uranium (HEU) from Russian nuclear weapons into low enriched uranium (LEU) for use in commercial nuclear reactors. However, there are concerns that the payments due to Russia under these agreements may be subject to legal processes in the United States, which could put the implementation of the agreements at risk. Therefore, President Obama has issued an executive order to block all property and interests in property of the Russian government related to the implementation of these agreements to protect them from any legal processes. He emphasizes that the goal of the United States is to ensure that the fissile material removed from Russian nuclear weapons is used for peaceful purposes and is protected from diversion to activities of proliferation concern. The letter concludes by stating that all appropriate measures will be taken to further implement the agreements and carry out the provisions of the executive order.
