On May 12, 2022, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, S. 497, known as the "American Fisheries Advisory Committee Act," requires the Department of Commerce to establish an American Fisheries Advisory Committee. This committee will assist in the awarding of fisheries research and development grants. The second bill, S. 658, known as the "National Cybersecurity Preparedness Consortium Act of 2021," authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to collaborate with a consortium of nonprofit entities. The goal is to develop, update, and deliver cybersecurity training to support homeland security efforts. The President expressed gratitude to the senators and representatives who showed leadership in these bills' passage. Senators Sullivan, Murkowski, Warren, Markey, Cantwell, Rubio, and Warnock, along with Representatives Radewagen, Huffman, and Case, were specifically mentioned for their contributions.
