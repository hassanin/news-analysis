President Donald J. Trump has awarded the Legion of Merit, Degree Chief Commander, to King Mohammed VI of Morocco. This prestigious decoration is rarely awarded and can only be bestowed by the President to chiefs of state or heads of government of other countries. King Mohammed VI has been recognized for his leadership over the past two decades and his efforts in strengthening the partnership between Morocco and the United States. His vision and personal courage, including his decision to resume ties with the State of Israel, have had a positive impact on the Middle East and North Africa region, bringing about a new era of security and prosperity. The award was accepted by Morocco's Ambassador to the United States, Princess Lalla Joumala, in a private ceremony.
