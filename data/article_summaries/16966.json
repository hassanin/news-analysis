President Obama has launched the "Every Kid in a Park" initiative, which provides free admission to National Parks and other federal lands and waters for all fourth grade students and their families for a full year. This initiative aims to encourage children to visit and enjoy America's outdoor spaces, as many families lack access to safe outdoor spaces and children are spending more time indoors. The initiative will also provide transportation support to schools in need, distribute educational materials, and increase investment in youth engagement programs. Additionally, the President has designated three new National Monuments: Pullman National Monument in Illinois, Browns Canyon National Monument in Colorado, and Honouliuli National Monument in Hawaii. These monuments will protect significant sites in American history and unique natural resources. President Obama has used the Antiquities Act to establish or expand 16 national monuments, protecting over 260 million acres of public lands and waters.
