President Obama has announced new executive actions aimed at making student loans more affordable. These actions include a Presidential Memorandum that will allow an additional 5 million borrowers with federal student loans to cap their monthly payments at 10 percent of their income. The President is also urging Congress to pass legislation that would allow an estimated 25 million Americans to refinance their outstanding student loans at lower interest rates. The President is using his pen and phone to take action and help borrowers manage their student loan debt. The Department of Education and the Department of Treasury will also be working together to provide education and resources to help students and families understand and claim education tax benefits.
