President Biden will establish the White House Task Force to Address Online Harassment and Abuse, recognizing the need for government intervention in addressing online harms, particularly those affecting women, girls, people of color, and LGBTQI+ individuals. Vice President Harris will launch the Task Force by hosting a survivor and expert roundtable. The Task Force aims to provide recommendations to prevent and address technology-facilitated gender-based violence, focusing on the connection between online misogyny and radicalization to violence. Recommendations will include increasing support for survivors, expanding research, enhancing prevention efforts, and strengthening accountability for offenders and platforms. The Task Force will be co-chaired by the Gender Policy Council and the National Security Council and will involve various federal agencies. The internet has become a tool for abuse, harassment, and exploitation, with online harassment affecting one in three women under the age of 35 in the United States. The Task Force seeks to address various forms of technology-facilitated gender-based violence, recognizing its serious consequences, including psychological distress, self-harm, disruptions to education, economic loss, and even physical and sexual violence. Women and LGBTQI+ leaders, activists, and journalists often face sexualized online harassment and abuse, undermining human rights and participation in democracy. Recent mass shootings have also highlighted the link between online harassment, misogyny, and extremist acts. President Biden and Vice President Harris have been committed to combating gender-based violence, including online, and are taking strategic actions to address online harassment and abuse.
