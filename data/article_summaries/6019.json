In Germany today, President Biden will meet with G7 leaders and President Zelenskyy to show support for Ukraine and impose new sanctions on Russia. The G7 will issue a statement of support for Ukraine, which will include significant new sanctions commitments against Russia. The United States has rallied over 30 allies and partners to impose costs on Russia, resulting in a decrease in U.S. exports to Russia and a potential 40% decrease in Russia's imports. Russia's economy is struggling, with a decline in GDP, rising inflation, and difficulties in making bond payments. The goal is to weaken Putin's military-industrial complex, deprive Russia of resources, and hold the kleptocracy accountable. The United States and the G7 will implement significant commitments, including sanctions on individuals and entities, action on evasion, tariffs on Russian goods, and restrictions on Russia's participation in the global market. The focus is also on imposing costs on those responsible for human rights abuses and providing financial, humanitarian, military, and diplomatic support to Ukraine.
