The President has also granted numerous commutations to individuals serving time in federal prison who were sentenced under outdated laws and policies. Other reforms include reducing disparities in sentencing, launching the "Smart on Crime" initiative to avoid excessive mandatory minimums for low-level drug offenders, and encouraging diversion and drug court programs to prioritize treatment over incarceration. The Department of Justice has also taken measures to enhance the credibility and accountability of the justice system, such as providing criminal defendants with comprehensive pre-trial evidence, requiring the videotaping of interrogations, and prohibiting the waiver of the right to appeal based on ineffective assistance of counsel.
