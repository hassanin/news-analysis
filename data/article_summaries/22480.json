The First Lady of the United States is currently in London, where she will meet with local students and discuss how the UK and US are collaborating to improve access to education for adolescent girls worldwide. She will also host a roundtable meeting on Let Girls Learn, meet with Prime Minister Cameron, Mrs. Cameron, and Prince Harry. The US and UK have announced a new partnership to advance adolescent girls' education, with a focus on fragile countries. They aim to overcome barriers that prevent girls from receiving an education, as it has many positive outcomes such as higher earning power, lower birth rates, and improved health. It is important for world leaders to work together to prioritize education for adolescent girls.
