Admiral Tim Ziemer, the Senior Director for Global Health Security at the National Security Council, discusses the importance of the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) in a Foreign Policy article. GHSA is a five-year initiative launched in 2014 to increase countries' health security capacity to prevent and respond to outbreaks of infectious diseases. Over 60 nations are involved in GHSA, working together to close gaps that allow diseases to spread. Ziemer emphasizes the need for global preparedness, as diseases can now travel from one point to another within 36 hours. The United States has committed $1 billion to support partner countries and strengthen implementation of health regulations. Ziemer outlines three objectives for the upcoming GHSA meeting in Uganda: extending GHSA to 2024, encouraging partners to sustain and strengthen their commitments, and fostering partnerships to prevent future outbreaks. The goal is to create a healthier and more prosperous world.
