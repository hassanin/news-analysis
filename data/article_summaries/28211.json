President Trump met with representatives from the biggest steel and aluminum companies in the United States to discuss the state of the industries and potential actions to be taken. The companies expressed their support for tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, citing unfair competition and the need for a level playing field. The President agreed with their concerns and stated that tariffs will be imposed on steel and aluminum imports, which he believes will lead to the growth and expansion of the industries. The tariffs will be 25 percent for steel and 10 percent for aluminum.
