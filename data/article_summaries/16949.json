President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the state of Kansas, ordering federal aid to supplement recovery efforts after severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding occurred between May 4 and June 21, 2015. The declaration makes federal funding available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures in various counties. Laura S. Hevesi has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments.
