President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has made a determination regarding the supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran. After considering various reports and factors such as global economic conditions and the availability of strategic reserves, President Biden has determined that there is enough supply from other countries to allow for a significant reduction in the volume of petroleum and petroleum products purchased from Iran through foreign financial institutions. He will continue to monitor the situation closely, and the Secretary of State has been authorized to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
