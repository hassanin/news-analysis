The article discusses several agreements and initiatives between the United States and Mexico. 

First, the two countries have reached a resolution to the cross-border long-haul trucking dispute. This will establish a reciprocal program that allows both Mexican and US long-haul carriers to engage in cross-border operations under NAFTA. Mexico will suspend its retaliatory tariffs once a final agreement is reached and the program is normalized.

Second, a High-Level Regulatory Cooperation Council has been created to improve regulatory cooperation and enhance the competitiveness of North American producers. The council aims to make regulations more compatible and simple, increase regulatory transparency, promote public participation, improve the analysis of regulations, link regulatory cooperation to improved border-crossing and customs procedures, and increase technical cooperation.

Third, the United States and Mexico are committed to combatting global climate change and creating markets for clean energy technologies. They will work together to implement agreements reached in Canc√∫n, including on transparency, technology, adaptation, and forest preservation. The two countries have also achieved milestones under the Bilateral Framework on Clean Energy and Climate Change, such as cooperating on wind resource mapping and testing and design of wind turbines.

Lastly, the United States and Mexico are negotiating an agreement on transboundary reservoirs. Both countries are committed to the safe and responsible exploitation of these resources and aim to conclude the negotiations by the end of 2011.
