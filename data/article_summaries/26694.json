The United States and the Slovak Republic are celebrating several notable anniversaries, including 30 years since the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia and 75 years since the Slovak National Uprising against Nazi occupation. These milestones reflect Slovakia's determination to align itself with the Western community of nations. The two nations share values such as individual liberty, prosperity, the rule of law, democracy, sovereignty, and a commitment to peace and security. They believe that NATO is the best guarantor of transatlantic and European security and emphasize the importance of meeting defense spending targets.

Both countries support Ukraine's sovereignty, territorial integrity, and energy security, and call for continued sanctions against Russia until the Minsk Agreements are fully implemented. Energy security is seen as fundamental to national security, and they oppose the use of energy projects as geopolitical weapons. The United States and Slovakia also emphasize fair and reciprocal trade and seek to increase investment and strengthen their trading relationship. They are committed to developing and implementing telecommunications security principles and enhancing cybersecurity cooperation.
