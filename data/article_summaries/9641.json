The White House Visitor Center will display an exhibit titled "Thank you to the United States: Three Gifts to Presidents in Gratitude for American Generosity Abroad." One of the gifts showcased is the Ghazir Rug, also known as the "Armenian Orphan Rug," which was given to President Coolidge in 1925 as a recognition of the humanitarian assistance provided by the American people to displaced Armenian orphans. The rug represents the Garden of Eden and took 18 months to complete, containing 4 million knots. It measures 11.5 feet by 19 feet and is in excellent condition. The rug was returned to the White House in 1982 as a gift from President Coolidge's family and has been displayed only twice since then. This rug symbolizes the strong relationship between Armenia and the United States. The other two items in the exhibit are a SÃ¨vres vase commissioned by the "Young People of France" as a gesture of appreciation for feeding children in post-World War I France, and Flowering Branches in Lucite, which were sent to President Obama to acknowledge American support for Japan after the 2010 earthquake and tsunami. The White House Visitor Center is located at 1450 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, and is open to the public from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily.
