The article discusses the White House's support for the S. 3992, also known as the Development, Relief and Education of Alien Minors Act or DREAM Act. The Act aims to provide conditional immigration status to individuals who came to the United States as children and have contributed to the prosperity and security of the country. To qualify for the Act, individuals must have arrived before the age of 16, lived in the US for at least five consecutive years, be under 30 years old, demonstrate good behavior, not be inadmissible or deportable, and have graduated from high school, obtained a GED, or been admitted to a US higher education institution. Before applying for permanent residency, they must complete at least two years of college or military service. The White House urges the Senate to pass the DREAM Act, emphasizing the need for comprehensive immigration reform that holds everyone accountable. The Act aims to provide an opportunity for young individuals who have spent most of their lives in the US to pursue higher education or serve in the military and contribute to the country.
