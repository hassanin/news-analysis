President Joe Biden has announced his intent to nominate Shelly Lowe as Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and Dr. Maria Rosario Jackson as Chair of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). If confirmed, Lowe will be the first Native American to serve as Chair of the NEH, while Jackson will be the first African American and Mexican American to serve as Chair of the NEA. Both agencies were established by Congress in 1965 to support research, education, and development in the arts and humanities. They work to celebrate America's cultural heritage and promote equal access to arts and humanities resources and programs. Lowe is a member of the National Council on the Humanities and has held various leadership roles in higher education. Jackson has a background in strategic planning and policy research, and she currently serves as an Institute Professor at Arizona State University. Both nominees have extensive experience in their respective fields and are dedicated to advancing the arts and humanities across America.
