The Biden Administration is purchasing one billion at-home, rapid COVID-19 tests to distribute to Americans for free. Starting on January 19th, a half-billion tests will be available for online ordering and will be mailed directly to households. Each residential address can request up to four free tests. To ensure equity and access, a call line will be launched for those unable to access the website. The Administration is also working with community-based organizations to support the hardest-hit communities. In addition to the free tests, there are over 20,000 free testing sites across the nation, an increase in pharmacies participating in the federal pharmacy free testing program, and federal surge free testing sites. Millions of at-home tests have been delivered to community health centers, rural health clinics, and schools. Private health insurance companies will be required to cover at-home tests for free, and 10 million tests will be made available to schools each month. Since January 2021, the Administration has increased the overall testing supply, authorized more tests for use, and expanded testing locations.
