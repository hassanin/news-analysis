The article is a letter from former President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House, stating that the national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria will continue beyond May 11, 2016. The letter highlights the regime's brutal war on the Syrian people and their pursuit of chemical and biological weapons, support for terrorist organizations, and obstruction of the Lebanese government. These actions pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The letter also condemns the Asad regime's use of violence and human rights abuses and calls for a political transition in Syria towards greater freedom, democracy, and justice. The United States will consider changes in the composition, policies, and actions of the Syrian government in determining whether to continue or terminate the national emergency in the future.
