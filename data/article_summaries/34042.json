The Office of National Drug Control Policy's United States Interdiction Coordinator (USIC) has recognized exceptional performers from the interagency interdiction community. These annual awards acknowledge individuals and units that have shown exceptional innovation, tactics, aggressiveness, and results in the fight against drug trafficking into the United States. The winners of the 2017 USIC awards come from various federal, state, local, and tribal agencies. The awards program was established in 2003 to acknowledge the superior performance of front-line drug interdictors and those who support them in countering drug-related transnational organized crime. The selection criteria cover the entire interdiction continuum.
