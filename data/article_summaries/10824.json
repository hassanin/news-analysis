The Equal Futures Partnership is an initiative launched by former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Valerie Jarrett on behalf of the United States in 2012. The partnership encourages member countries to empower women politically and economically through legal, regulatory, and policy reforms. The goal is to ensure women lead and benefit from inclusive economic growth and fully participate in public life. The partnership includes countries such as Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Chile, Croatia, Denmark, and many others. Multilateral stakeholders, including UN Women and the World Bank, as well as businesses and non-profit institutions, also support the partnership. Each participating country works with key stakeholders to identify priorities, set achievable goals, exchange best practices, and report on progress. New member commitments include efforts to address the gender pay gap, workplace discrimination, female entrepreneurship, and women in leadership positions. The partnership collaborates with multilateral partners such as the World Bank and UN Women to strengthen and implement country efforts. Countries committed to promoting women's political and economic participation are welcome to join the partnership.
