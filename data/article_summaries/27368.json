President Donald J. Trump is taking steps to ensure the safety and security of schools. He aims to make schools as safe as airports, stadiums, and government buildings. This includes strengthening background checks and law enforcement operations. President Trump is also proposing the expansion and reform of mental health programs to identify and treat individuals who may pose a threat. Additionally, he is establishing a Federal Commission on School Safety, chaired by Secretary Betsy DeVos, to recommend policy and funding proposals for school violence prevention.
