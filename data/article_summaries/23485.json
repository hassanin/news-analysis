This article is a Presidential Memorandum from June 20, 2014, titled "Creating a Federal Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators." The memorandum emphasizes the importance of pollinators to the economy and the environment and highlights the significant loss of pollinators, including honey bees, native bees, birds, bats, and butterflies, in recent decades. The memo states that these losses pose a threat to food production systems, the agricultural sector, and the environment. The main causes of pollinator losses are identified as poor nutrition, loss of forage lands, parasites, pathogens, lack of genetic diversity, and exposure to pesticides. In response to this problem, the memorandum establishes the Pollinator Health Task Force, co-chaired by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and includes representatives from various executive departments and agencies. The Task Force is tasked with developing a National Pollinator Health Strategy within 180 days, which will include goals, milestones, and metrics to measure progress. The strategy will focus on research, education, public-private partnerships, and enhancing pollinator habitat. The memorandum also directs various federal departments and agencies to take immediate measures to support pollinators, such as planting pollinator-friendly vegetation and limiting the use of pesticides in sensitive pollinator habitats.
