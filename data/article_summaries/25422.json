The Department of Labor has reported that the number of workers receiving unemployment benefits is at its lowest level in 44 years. In the most recent month, only 1.73 million workers were receiving benefits, the lowest number since December 1973. This suggests that layoffs are rare and that laid-off workers are finding jobs more easily.
