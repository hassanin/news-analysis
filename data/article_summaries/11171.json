President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Missouri and authorized federal aid to assist with recovery efforts from severe storms, winds, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred between May 29 and June 10, 2013. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The affected counties include Barton, Callaway, Cape Girardeau, and many others. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for federal funding. Michael L. Parker has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Further designations may be made if requested by the state and deemed necessary based on damage assessments. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
