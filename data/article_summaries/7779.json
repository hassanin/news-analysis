President Joe Biden has issued an executive order outlining his administration's policy on refugee resettlement in the United States. The order emphasizes the importance of refugee resettlement as a humanitarian response to global crises and commits to rebuilding and expanding the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). The order also calls for improved security vetting and fraud detection measures, as well as a focus on the fair treatment of applicants without discrimination. It highlights the need for transparency, accountability, and family reunification in the administration of humanitarian programs. Additionally, the order addresses the Special Immigrant Visa programs for Iraqi and Afghan allies, urging their timely administration. It also includes steps to improve the efficacy, integrity, security, and transparency of USRAP, such as coordinating agencies and vetting partners, enhancing fraud detection measures, and expanding refugee adjudication capacity. The order further emphasizes the consideration of vulnerable individuals, the use of technology, and the exploration of public-private partnerships in refugee resettlement. It calls for a review of the Iraqi and Afghan SIV programs and the development of a plan to address concerns. The order also directs a review of policies and procedures related to USRAP, including mechanisms to synthesize country conditions, timely access to application records, and the provision of explanations for denial decisions. Furthermore, the order seeks to address processing backlogs, improve vetting processes, and examine the impact of climate change on migration. The order concludes with general provisions, emphasizing that it does not override existing authorities or create enforceable rights.
