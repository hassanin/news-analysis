In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims November as National Hospice Month. He highlights the importance of hospice care in providing dignity, medical services, emotional support, and spiritual resources to individuals facing life-limiting illnesses. Hospice care also helps families and caregivers in managing the challenges of caring for a dying loved one. The article mentions that the Affordable Care Act expands and protects hospice services covered under Federal health care programs. It eliminates the prohibition on concurrent care, allowing patients to receive hospice care while still receiving treatments to cure their disease. This change particularly benefits children enrolled in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. The article encourages all Americans to recognize the important work of hospice care and participate in activities that promote awareness of its role.
