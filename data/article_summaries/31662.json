In this article, President Donald J. Trump proclaims May 2018 as National Mental Health Awareness Month. He acknowledges the progress made in providing treatment and support for individuals with mental illnesses, but emphasizes that stigma and misconceptions about mental health still persist. He highlights that approximately one in five Americans experiences a mental illness, but only about one third of them seek treatment. To combat this, President Trump's fiscal year 2019 budget request includes $10 billion in new funding to address serious mental illness and the opioid epidemic. The budget also requests funding for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to ensure more adults with serious mental illness receive Assertive Community Treatment. Additionally, the budget maintains funding for the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant and includes investments to divert individuals with serious mental illnesses from the criminal justice system and into treatment. President Trump has appointed the first Assistant Secretary of Mental Health and Substance Use to improve the quality and availability of treatment. He has also launched the Interdepartmental Serious Mental Illness Coordinating Committee to coordinate services across multiple agencies. The goal is to eliminate the stigma of mental illness, increase awareness, and provide hope for recovery and healthier lives.
