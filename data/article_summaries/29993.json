The White House and federal agencies are working with Schema.org, a collaborative community founded by tech companies, to make sure that the most up-to-date public health guidance and information on COVID-19 testing facilities are easily accessible to the American people. Schema.org has released new standard tags for webpages containing COVID-19 information, and the White House has directed federal Chief Information Officers to incorporate these tags into federally maintained webpages. They are also encouraging the private sector, state and local governments, and the academic community to do the same. The goal is to help Americans find official public health announcements and information, as well as locate COVID-19 testing facilities in their communities. The White House has called on the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development program to provide instructions for marking up websites, and efforts are underway to develop additional tags for scientific and auxiliary information related to COVID-19. This initiative is part of the Trump Administration's commitment to ensuring that every American has access to timely and relevant public health updates.
