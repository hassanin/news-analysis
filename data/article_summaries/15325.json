President Obama has issued a memorandum to reduce unnecessary regulatory and administrative burdens for State, Tribal, and local governments. The goal is to focus resources on achieving better outcomes at lower cost, especially as many governments face budget shortfalls. The memorandum instructs the Director of OMB to lead a collaborative process with Federal agencies and governments to streamline procedures. Agencies are also required to work closely with governments to identify barriers in Federally-funded programs that prevent efficient use of tax dollars. The memorandum also directs OMB to review cost principles and audits for governments, standardize reporting and planning requirements, and facilitate modernization of information systems. Agencies must report back within 180 days on their actions. The memorandum builds on existing collaborations and initiatives proposed in the President's 2012 Budget to achieve better results at lower cost, such as the Partnership Fund for Program Integrity Innovation and Pay for Success pilots. Other proposals include a Workforce Innovation Fund, waiver authority for labor and education departments, and a "First in the World" competition for colleges and universities. These initiatives aim to reduce taxpayer costs and improve outcomes for constituents, supporting the nation's long-term economic strength and competitiveness.
