With less than a week remaining in the fiscal year, extreme House Republicans are risking a government shutdown that would have negative consequences across the country. This includes potential delays for travelers and forcing air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Officers to work without pay. More than 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 Transportation Security Officers, along with other FAA and TSA personnel, would be affected by this shutdown. Previous shutdowns have resulted in significant delays and longer wait times for travelers at airports. Additionally, the shutdown would halt air traffic controller training, potentially disrupting the industry in the long term. The reason for these transportation priorities being at risk is the extreme House Republicans' efforts to cut funding for vital programs instead of working in a bipartisan manner to keep the government open and address emergency needs. Their proposed continuing resolution includes devastating cuts to programs that many hardworking Americans rely on, such as rail safety inspections and the Transportation Security Administration. Furthermore, the resolution does not provide the urgent funding requested by President Biden to avoid disruptions to FAA air traffic operations.
