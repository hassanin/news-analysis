President Joseph R. Biden has proclaimed January 2023 as National Mentoring Month in the United States. In light of the challenges faced by young people due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the administration is emphasizing the importance of mentors in helping children navigate these complexities and succeed academically and socially. The American Rescue Plan has provided significant funding for schools to reopen safely and invest in tutoring, afterschool activities, summer learning, and enrichment programs. Additionally, the plan allocated $1 billion to AmeriCorps to expand national service projects, including the recruitment of new mentors, tutors, and student success coaches. The Department of Labor is also working to connect young people who have dropped out of high school with pre-apprenticeship opportunities in high-demand industries. Furthermore, the National Partnership for Student Success, a collaboration between the Department of Education, AmeriCorps, and the Johns Hopkins Everyone Graduates Center, aims to add 250,000 tutors and mentors across the country over the next three years. President Biden encourages Americans to explore these mentorship opportunities and consider becoming mentors or tutors. He also calls on school districts to utilize the funding provided by the American Rescue Plan to hire more mentors and tutors, particularly in subjects like science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The president urges colleges, universities, employers, unions, families, communities, and individuals to play a role in helping the next generation of Americans achieve their dreams.
