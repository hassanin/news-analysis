The Biden Administration is facilitating the air shipment of approximately 849,000 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Nestlé NAN EXPERTpro SensiPro infant formula from Australia to Fort Worth, Texas. This is part of Operation Fly Formula, which aims to speed up the import of infant formula and ensure its availability in stores. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has allowed Nestlé to export additional infant formula into the U.S., and Nestlé plans to bring approximately 42 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents into the market over time. The Biden Administration has also invoked the Defense Production Act, reopened a facility, and issued guidance to ensure an adequate supply of safe infant formula.
