First Lady Melania Trump visited Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall in Arlington, Virginia, to spend time with the spouses of senior Department of Defense and service leaders. She began her speech by wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and apologizing for her laryngitis. Melania then held up the book "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" and read a page from it. She invited a child named Adam to come up and read a page as well. Melania expressed that military children understand the true meaning of the holidays and that the most meaningful gifts are not material possessions, but rather friendships, time with loved ones, and the opportunity to serve one's community and country. She acknowledged the sacrifices military children make, such as supporting their parents during deployments and taking care of family members who may have returned with illnesses or injuries. Melania mentioned that the White House also decorates trees and lights, with 77 trees and millions of lights in total. She shared that there is a special room called "We the Children" that honors kids like the ones in attendance, showcasing their drawings and reflecting the magic they bring to the holidays. Melania expressed her gratitude to Toys for Tots for bringing everyone together and concluded her speech by wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and encouraging them to receive as much love as they give during the holiday season. She then introduced Samara Donahue, a military child with aspirations of becoming President of the United States. Melania expressed her support for Samara and invited her to address the audience. The event ended at 12:50 P.M. EST.
