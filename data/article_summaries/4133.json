The White House commemorated National Foster Care Month with a roundtable discussion featuring seven young people who have experienced the child welfare system. The meeting was led by various officials, including Assistant Secretary of the Administration for Children and Families January Contreras and White House American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling. The participants came from different states and discussed several important topics, including the need for increased mental health services and trauma support for children in foster care, the importance of kinship care and sibling connections, and the link between the child welfare system and the criminal justice system. They also highlighted the disproportionate impact of the system on children of color and LGBTQI+ youth. Administration officials emphasized President Biden and Vice President Harris' commitment to child welfare reforms, including a proposed $10 billion increase in funding for the fiscal year 2023 Budget. They also mentioned the administration's focus on equity, addressing the national mental health crisis, and the resources available to foster youth through the American Rescue Plan.
