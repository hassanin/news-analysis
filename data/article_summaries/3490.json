The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia L. Fudge and Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice have held a meeting of the Interagency Task Force on Property Appraisal and Valuation Equity (PAVE). This Task Force, created by President Biden in June, aims to address the misvaluation and undervaluation of properties owned by families and communities of color. The Task Force has been gathering input from various stakeholders, including the housing industry, civil rights organizations, advocacy groups, academic institutions, and philanthropic organizations. The discussion in the meeting focused on updating appraisal standards and guidance, coordinating regulatory action, and sharing data between agencies to support policy development, monitoring, and enforcement of fair housing laws. The Task Force will submit a final action report to the President in early 2022, which will include a description of the extent and causes of misvaluation and undervaluation of properties, as well as policy recommendations and consumer-facing actions to advance racial equity in the appraisal process. The Task Force consists of senior leaders from Cabinet and independent agencies within the federal government.
