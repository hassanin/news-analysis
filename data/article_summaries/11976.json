The United States has announced two new measures to pressure and isolate the Iranian government for its failure to meet international obligations. The first measure is a new Executive Order that imposes sanctions on the Iranian energy and petrochemical sectors. This is aimed at deterring Iran from establishing payment mechanisms to circumvent existing sanctions. The second measure is the imposition of sanctions on two financial institutions, Bank of Kunlun in China and Elaf Islamic Bank in Iraq, for facilitating transactions on behalf of Iranian banks linked to proliferation activities. These actions demonstrate the US commitment to hold Iran accountable and warn that increasing consequences will be imposed if Iran continues to defy its international obligations.
