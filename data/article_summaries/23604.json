The Obama Administration has reported that the recipients of Recovery Act funds have created or saved 640,329 direct jobs. These jobs were reported in reports covering approximately $160 billion, which is less than half of the funds put to work through September 30, 2009. The majority of the jobs were in the construction and education sectors. The reports were filed by state and local governments, private companies, colleges and universities, and community organizations. The reports will be posted publicly on Recovery.gov. The Administration is on track to meet its goal of creating and saving at least 3.5 million jobs through the Recovery Act. The states with the highest unemployment rates reported 25% more jobs created and saved per capita than the nation as a whole. The recipient reports provide detailed information about the funds received, how they were spent, and the direct job impact. The Recovery Act has helped to create or retain over a million jobs so far.
