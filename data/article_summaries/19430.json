The White House Press Secretary released a statement expressing support for the Senate's repeal of the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, which banned openly gay men and women from serving in the military. The statement highlighted that allowing gay individuals to serve openly will strengthen national security and uphold equality. The President is eager to sign the bill into law.
