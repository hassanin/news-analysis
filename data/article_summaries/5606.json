President Biden has declared a state of emergency in Louisiana due to the conditions caused by Tropical Storm Nicholas. This declaration allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate disaster relief efforts and provide assistance to alleviate the hardships faced by the local population. FEMA is authorized to mobilize equipment and resources to mitigate the impacts of the emergency. The assistance provided will include direct federal assistance and reimbursement for mass care, such as evacuation and shelter support, at a 75 percent federal funding rate. John E. Long has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas.
