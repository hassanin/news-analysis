The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the current monkeypox outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. This decision calls for a coordinated, international response to stop the spread of the virus. The Biden Administration has implemented a comprehensive strategy in the US, which includes increasing vaccine procurement, distribution, and production, expanding access to testing and treatments, and communicating with high-risk communities. However, more action is needed to aggressively combat the virus and protect affected communities in the United States.
