Vice President Mike Pence wrote an op-ed in The Denver Post advocating for President Trump's tax-cut plan. Pence argues that Colorado needs a tax cut, and Trump's plan will deliver more money to working families and create a brighter future for job creators. He criticizes the current tax system for taking too much money from working Americans and driving businesses overseas. Pence believes that the tax cuts for businesses will boost wages for workers and provide relief for working families in Colorado. He calls on Colorado's representatives and senators to support the tax-cut plan, emphasizing that tax reform has brought both parties together in the past and should do so again for the benefit of the state and the nation.
