This executive order, issued on April 18, 2017, focuses on promoting American products and protecting American workers. It defines "Buy American Laws" as statutes, regulations, and executive orders related to federal procurement or grants that require or prefer the purchase of goods produced in the United States. The order emphasizes the policy of the executive branch to maximize the use of American goods, products, and materials in federal financial assistance awards and procurements. It also aims to rigorously enforce immigration laws to protect the economic interests of American workers. The order requires agencies to assess and monitor compliance with Buy American Laws, minimize the use of waivers, and develop policies to maximize the use of American materials. The Secretary of Commerce and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget are directed to issue guidance to agencies on making assessments and developing policies. The impacts of free trade agreements on Buy American Laws are to be assessed, and a report with recommendations for strengthening implementation of Buy American Laws is to be submitted to the President. The order also emphasizes the judicious use of waivers and proposes reforms to the H-1B visa program to ensure that visas are awarded to the most skilled or highest-paid beneficiaries.
