President Donald J. Trump and Taoiseach Enda Kenny of Ireland met last week to discuss United States-Ireland economic and cultural ties as part of the White House's St. Patrick's Day celebration. They agreed on the importance of expanding the trade relationship between the two countries and finding new opportunities for collaboration on global issues. They also discussed the consequences and opportunities for Ireland following the UK's decision to leave the European Union. Additionally, they emphasized the importance of Northern Ireland's political parties finding a way forward on a shared regional government to sustain the peace process.
