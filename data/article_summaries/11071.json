President Obama has signed an executive order creating the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, with members from both parties. The commission will be led by former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles and former Republican Senate disciplinarian Alan Simpson. The goal of the commission is to generate consensus between both parties in order to address the country's fiscal challenges. The commission will make recommendations for achieving a primary budget balance by 2015 and improving long-term fiscal prospects. The commission will consist of a total of 18 members, with 12 members appointed by the leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives, and 6 members appointed by the President. The commission's recommendations will require 14 out of 18 votes to be reported to Congress by December 1, 2010. The President has emphasized the need for fiscal responsibility and has taken steps to reduce the deficit and reform healthcare.
