The members of the International Counter Ransomware Initiative (CRI) recently met in Washington, DC to reaffirm their commitment to building collective resilience to ransomware and to cooperate in disrupting ransomware attacks. They also aim to counter the illicit finance that supports the ransomware ecosystem and work with the private sector to defend against these attacks. The CRI supports the implementation of the UN framework for responsible state behavior in cyberspace and the consensus conclusions and recommendations of the UN Expert Group on Cybercrime. The members plan to establish a voluntary International Counter Ransomware Task Force (ICRTF) to develop tools and exchange cyber threat intelligence. They also aim to share information and take action to disrupt and hold accountable criminal ransomware actors. The CRI is dedicated not only to protecting its members but also helping other countries counter ransomware. They intend to establish mechanisms for notifying financial institutions of ransomware payments and work towards implementing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing controls. The private sector plays a crucial role in these efforts, and the CRI is collaborating with them to share information and set goals to prevent and respond to ransomware threats. Diplomatic engagement is seen as essential in the fight against ransomware, and the CRI plans to work with other partners and engage in regional efforts and multilateral frameworks. They also aim to strengthen resilience, improve disruption capabilities, increase law enforcement capacities, and support the development of legal frameworks through capacity-building programs and cyber exercises.
