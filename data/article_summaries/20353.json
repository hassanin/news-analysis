President Obama has signed eight small business tax cuts into law and pledges to sign eight more. The existing tax cuts include a new small business health care tax credit, a tax credit for hiring unemployed workers, bonus depreciation tax incentives, and an expansion of limits on small business expensing, among others. The proposed tax cuts include zero capital gains taxes on key investments in small businesses, an extension of the highest small business expensing limit ever, and a new deduction for health care expenses for the self-employed, among others. Republicans are using the pretext of helping small businesses to fight for an average of $100,000 in tax cuts for those with incomes over $1 million. The President's proposed tax cuts would directly help millions of real small businesses. The Small Business Jobs Bill, which includes these tax cuts, aims to provide tax relief and access to credit for small businesses to expand, grow, and hire. It also includes measures to support small businesses in accessing credit.
