The White House has announced that the American Rescue Plan's Child Care Stabilization Program has provided aid to over 200,000 child care providers, helping them keep their doors open and serving up to 9.5 million children. The program has also helped more than 1 million child care workers retain their jobs. A state-by-state analysis of the program reveals the number of providers assisted in each state. The grants provided through the program have helped cover operational costs and basic needs, such as wages, rent, utilities, and supplies. The program has prevented a wave of closures, ensuring that parents can continue working. Some states, like Maine, have even reported an increase in licensed child care capacity. The American Rescue Plan also includes support for working families to afford child care, such as flexible funding for states through the Child Care and Development Fund. The plan has raised income eligibility for support, served additional children, and waived copayments in states like New Mexico. In addition, the plan has increased the maximum Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and made it fully refundable, benefiting lower-income parents. The expansion of the Child Tax Credit has also provided financial aid to working parents. State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds are being utilized to support child care, such as covering co-payments and funding construction projects to expand capacity. Despite the assistance provided by the American Rescue Plan, the cost of child care has been a challenge for families even before the pandemic, and President Biden is committed to ensuring access to affordable quality child care.
