In this letter, President Barack Obama informs the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate about his decision to authorize targeted airstrikes by the U.S. Armed Forces in support of Iraqi forces' efforts to recapture the Mosul Dam from the terrorist group, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The President states that these military operations will be limited in scope and duration and are necessary to prevent the failure of the dam, which could endanger civilian lives and U.S. personnel and facilities, including the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. He asserts that these actions are in the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States and are conducted under his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. The President also mentions that these actions are being carried out in coordination with the Iraqi government and provides this report to fulfill his obligation to keep Congress informed under the War Powers Resolution. He expresses his appreciation for the support of Congress in this action.
