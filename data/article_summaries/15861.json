This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Ukraine. The national emergency was declared on March 6, 2014, due to the actions and policies of individuals undermining democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine, threatening its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and contributing to the misappropriation of its assets. The national emergency has been expanded through several executive orders to address the actions and policies of the Russian Federation, including the annexation of Crimea and the use of force in Ukraine. The national emergency is being continued for another year, as it is deemed to still pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
