On June 16, 2006, the President declared a national emergency in response to the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus, which posed a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. This included undermining Belarus's democratic processes, human rights abuses, and public corruption. On August 9, 2021, the scope of the national emergency was expanded due to the Belarusian regime's harmful activities and long-standing abuses, including suppressing democracy and human rights, and disrupting international civil air travel. The national emergency, initially declared in 2006 and expanded in 2021, is now being extended for another year beyond June 16, 2023. This extension is necessary as the actions and policies of certain members of the Belarusian government and the regime's harmful activities continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
