The President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, along with several industry leaders, has announced a commitment to double the number of engineering internships available in 2012. This is part of an effort to address the engineering shortage in the United States and graduate 10,000 more engineering students each year. The commitments will add approximately 6,300 additional opportunities for hands-on, technical job experience for engineering students. The goal is to train and retain the best engineers in order to stay competitive in the global market. The engineering gap threatens America's role as a leading innovator and hinders job creation and competitiveness in the global economy. The announcement was made at a regional listening and action session in Portland, Oregon, where Secretary of Energy Steven Chu joined business leaders and engineering school deans to discuss steps the private sector can take to increase the number of engineering graduates. 45 industry leaders have committed to doubling their internship opportunities, and five additional companies have committed to increasing their internships. The President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness was formed in 2011 to promote job creation, innovation, growth, and competitiveness in the United States economy.
