First Lady Jill Biden has announced The Military Children's Corner, a new art display at the White House dedicated to honoring and educating Americans about the experiences of military children. The display is part of Dr. Biden's Joining Forces initiative, which aims to support military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors. The art display features artwork from military children currently at military installations that Dr. Biden has engaged with during her time as First Lady. It also includes artwork from Sesame Street's character, Rosita, whose dad is a veteran. The Military Children's Corner is located in the East Colonnade of the White House and will be updated regularly with art from military-connected children around the world. This initiative builds on previous art installations at the White House, highlighting the unique experiences of military-connected families. Joining Forces focuses on the needs of military and veteran families in the areas of Economic Opportunity, Military Child Education, and Health and Well-Being.
