President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order to protect free speech on college campuses. The order aims to address the issue of universities becoming increasingly hostile to free speech and the First Amendment. Under the order, federal agencies will use their authority to ensure that public universities protect the First Amendment rights of their students or risk losing federal taxpayer dollars. The order also directs the Department of Education to propose a plan that will require colleges and universities to share a portion of the financial risk of student loan debt. The Trump administration plans to work towards providing relief for the over $1 trillion in student loan debt. The President emphasized the importance of freedom of speech on college campuses and encouraged students to continue standing up for their values and speaking their minds.
