In this article, President Barack Obama issues a Presidential Memorandum suspending limitations under the Jerusalem Embassy Act. The Act, passed in 1995, aimed to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. However, President Obama determines that, in order to protect national security interests, it is necessary to suspend the limitations set forth in sections 3(b) and 7(b) of the Act for a period of 6 months. The Secretary of State is instructed to transmit this determination to Congress along with a report, and the determination will be published in the Federal Register. The suspension will take effect after the transmission of the determination and report to Congress.
