The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, released a statement expressing disappointment in the Republicans' decision to block a small business jobs bill proposed by the President. The bill aimed to provide tax credits for small business owners who hire workers and give raises, as well as incentives for businesses to invest in America. The statement emphasized the President's efforts to support small businesses, including signing 18 small business tax cuts into law. Carney criticized Republicans for prioritizing politics over job creation and urged them to start working on behalf of the American people.
