President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Illinois and ordered Federal aid to help with recovery efforts after severe storms and flooding in April and May 2011. The declaration makes Federal funding available to affected individuals and counties for temporary housing, home repairs, low-cost loans, and other recovery programs. Hazard mitigation measures will also receive funding on a cost-sharing basis statewide. Gregory W. Eaton has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made later if requested by the State. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance online or by phone.
