The article discusses President Biden's executive order to protect and rebuild the career Federal workforce in the United States. The order revokes the creation of Schedule F, which was seen as undermining the civil service and its merit system principles. It also revokes several executive orders related to collective bargaining and transparency in union time use. The heads of agencies are instructed to review and suspend, revise, or rescind any actions related to these orders. The order also emphasizes the right to engage in collective bargaining and calls for recommendations to promote a $15/hour minimum wage for Federal employees. The order includes general provisions, such as not impairing the authority granted by law to executive departments and agencies, and implementing the order consistent with applicable law and subject to appropriations.
