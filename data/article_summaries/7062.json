In this letter, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. informs the Speaker (or President) that he has issued a proclamation under the National Emergencies Act and the Magnuson Act. The proclamation is in response to the policies and actions of the Russian government in their war against Ukraine, which the President deems as a national emergency due to its impact on international relations with the United States. The proclamation prohibits Russian-affiliated vessels from entering US ports, except for certain exceptions such as vessels transporting nuclear materials or in cases of force majeure. The Secretary of Homeland Security is authorized to create rules and regulations regarding the movement and anchorage of these vessels. The President encloses a copy of the proclamation with the letter.
