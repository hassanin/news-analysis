President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the state of New Hampshire, providing federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following severe storms and flooding in May 2011. The funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has appointed Craig A. Gilbert as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Further designations may be made based on damage assessments.
