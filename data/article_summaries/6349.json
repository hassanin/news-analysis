Vice President Kamala Harris has announced a series of collaborative initiatives between the United States and France to address global issues and emerging threats. The initiatives focus on space cooperation and international cooperation in cybersecurity. Both countries recognize the importance of space in providing benefits to humanity, such as tackling climate challenges, enabling exploration and scientific discovery, and ensuring economic development and security. The United States and France will seek greater cooperation in these areas based on their shared vision and more than 60 years of joint space activities. In terms of cybersecurity, the United States is committed to working with allies and partners, including France, to advance cybersecurity and uphold global norms in cyberspace. This announcement builds on the United States' ongoing efforts to improve cybersecurity, including rallying G7 countries to hold nations accountable for harboring cyber criminals, updating NATO cyber policy, and engaging with over 30 countries to combat cybercrime. These initiatives underscore the United States' commitment to collaborating with allies and partners to address the challenges of the 21st century.
