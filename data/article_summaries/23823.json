The First Lady will also open a panel discussion with experts in the field, such as Andrew Lloyd Webber and Cicely Tyson. The day will conclude with remarks from the First Lady and a performance featuring music from popular Broadway shows. This one-hour special, called Broadway at the White House, will air on TLC on Thanksgiving. 

On November 17th, as part of the Let Girls Learn initiative, the First Lady will welcome students from London's Mulberry School for Girls. She will also present the 2015 National Arts and Humanities Youth Program Awards to students representing 12 after-school programs from across the country and 1 international program.
