In a recent statement, the government criticized a district judge in Seattle for issuing an injunction that prevents the detention of undocumented immigrants until their immigration court proceedings are completed. The government argues that the decision goes against a statutory prohibition on granting class-wide injunctive relief and also deems a statute passed by Congress during the Clinton administration as unconstitutional. The government believes that the injunction undermines the rule of law and encourages smugglers and traffickers, ultimately leading to an overwhelming of the immigration system. They assert that no single district judge should have the authority to impose their open borders views on the country and call for the restoration of democracy and the protection of American voices as outlined in the Constitution.
