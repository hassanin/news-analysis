President Obama declared a major disaster in the state of Kansas due to a severe winter storm and record-breaking snowfall that occurred in March 2009. This declaration allows federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, snow removal, and emergency protective measures. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) named Michael L. Karl as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA.
