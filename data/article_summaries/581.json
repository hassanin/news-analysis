President Joe Biden has issued a broader pardon for marijuana possession and use offenses to address historic injustices and racial disparities in drug policies. Last year, he granted a blanket pardon for simple marijuana possession under federal and D.C. law. These pardons aim to help thousands of people by making it easier for them to find employment, purchase homes, and access education. President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are committed to reforming the criminal justice system and changing the nation's approach to marijuana. Additionally, President Biden has commuted the sentences of 11 individuals serving time for non-violent drug offenses, exercising his clemency power more than any recent predecessor. The administration will continue to work towards addressing inequities in federal drug policy and sentencing to ensure equal justice for all.
