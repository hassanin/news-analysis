In a joint statement, the Presidents of France, Russia, and the United States have called for a peaceful settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. They emphasize that only a negotiated settlement can bring peace, stability, and regional development. The use of force would only lead to more suffering and be condemned by the international community. Significant progress has been made with the latest version of the Basic Principles, which provides a foundation for a comprehensive peace settlement. The Presidents urge the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan to finalize the Basic Principles during their upcoming summit in June, and they offer their support in the drafting and implementation of a peace agreement.
