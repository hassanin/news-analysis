President Obama has announced the Better Buildings Initiative, a plan to make American businesses more energy efficient. The goal is to make commercial buildings 20% more energy efficient by 2020 through incentives for upgrades. This initiative is expected to save businesses $40 billion per year in energy bills. The plan includes reforming incentives and challenging the private sector to take action. The President's budget also proposes new tax incentives for building efficiency and financing opportunities for commercial retrofits. Additionally, there will be a "Race to Green" competition for state and municipal governments to streamline regulations and attract private investment. CEOs and University Presidents are being challenged to make their organizations leaders in saving energy. The plan also includes training programs for commercial building technology workers. The Better Buildings Initiative complements previous initiatives for government and residential buildings, including funding for building energy efficiency in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).
