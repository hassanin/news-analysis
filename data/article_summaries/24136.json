The White House Office of the Press Secretary has released a fact sheet announcing new support for My Brother's Keeper (MBK), an initiative launched by President Obama in 2014 to address opportunity gaps facing boys and young men of color. The fact sheet highlights the progress made by MBK, including the acceptance of the MBK Community Challenge by nearly 250 communities, and the commitment of over $1 billion in private sector and philanthropic grants. The fact sheet also outlines new federal commitments to support MBK, such as the establishment of the National Student Attendance, Engagement, and Success Center to prevent chronic absenteeism, and the creation of APIs to provide access to data on youth outcomes. Additionally, the fact sheet mentions recent federal commitments, such as new regulations to address racial and ethnic disparities in special education, and guidance and technical assistance materials to support youth transitioning from juvenile justice facilities. The fact sheet also highlights new private sector commitments, including an additional $25 million commitment by the California Endowment to support boys and young men of color in California, and the NBA's goal to recruit 25,000 new mentors for MBK. Finally, the fact sheet discusses upcoming investments by My Brother's Keeper Alliance, including the launch of a comprehensive online support platform and the development of data dashboard platforms.
