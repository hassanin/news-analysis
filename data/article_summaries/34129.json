During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders discussed the RAISE Act, a proposed immigration reform endorsed by President Trump. The act aims to implement a points-based system similar to those used in Australia and Canada, which would prioritize immigrants who speak English, can support themselves financially, and possess skills that would benefit the US economy. The act also seeks to limit family-based migration to spouses and minor children, and eliminate the practice of chain migration. Sanders also addressed questions about the President's phone calls with foreign leaders, his signing of the Russia sanctions bill, and the issue of lying from the podium. She concluded the briefing by reading a letter from a 10-year-old boy who offered to mow the White House lawn.
