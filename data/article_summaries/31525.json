President Donald Trump has issued a Presidential Memorandum directing a review of the Thirteenth Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation. The review aims to assess the principles and concepts of the compensation system for members of the uniformed services. The President emphasizes the need to recognize the sacrifices of military personnel and adequately reward their efforts, as well as encourage future generations to serve. The structure of the military compensation system has remained largely unchanged, except for recent changes to military retirement. The Executive Agent appointed for this review is responsible for ensuring the participation of representatives from other executive departments and agencies.
