The number of Americans filing for new unemployment benefits has reached a nearly five-decade low. Initial jobless claims declined to 203,000 in the last week of August, the lowest level since the end of 1969. This indicates a tight labor market in the US. Jobless claims have remained low in recent years due to a strong labor market and difficulty finding qualified employees. The unemployment rate fell to 3.9% in July, near its lowest level since April 2000. The second quarter saw the strongest economic growth since 2014, and the manufacturing industry is experiencing strong growth.
