The Biden Administration has facilitated the air shipment of 5 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of Danone Aptamil Gold Plus routine infant formula. These deliveries were transported from New Zealand to Chicago, Illinois on August 29 and September 2. The products will be distributed through retailers. This initiative, called Operation Fly Formula, aims to speed up the import of infant formula and ensure that it reaches stores, hospitals, and home health care providers faster. The Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the General Services Administration, and the Department of Defense are partnering to pick up overseas infant formula that meets U.S. health and safety standards. So far, Operation Fly Formula has transported over 83 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents to the U.S. The Biden Administration has also taken other actions to ensure there is enough safe infant formula, including invoking the Defense Production Act, reopening Abbott Nutrition's facility, and issuing FDA guidance for importing formula not currently produced for the U.S. market.
