President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster for the Tohono Oâ€™odham Nation and authorized Federal aid to assist with the recovery efforts following severe storms and flooding from October 1 to October 3, 2018. The Federal funding will be available to the Tribe and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures will also be eligible for Federal funding. Mark Wingate has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for the recovery operations in the affected areas. Further designations may be made in the future if requested by the Tribe and based on additional damage assessments.
