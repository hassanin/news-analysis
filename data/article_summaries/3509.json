The Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized de-escalating and ending the conflict in Yemen through diplomatic engagements. The UN-brokered truce that began in March 2022 has brought nearly 15 months of calm to Yemen, the quietest period since the war began almost a decade ago. U.S. officials, including Special Envoy for Yemen Tim Lenderking and Middle East Coordinator Brett McGurk, have been focused on expanding the truce and addressing other issues in the region. Saudi Arabia has been credited for its efforts to support the truce, including facilitating hajj flights for Yemenis. The United States remains engaged with all parties to consolidate the benefits of the truce and work towards ending the war through a Yemeni-led political process.
