The White House and the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) have launched the Startup in a Day initiative, a partnership with U.S. cities to develop online tools that simplify the process of starting a business. The initiative aims to reduce the time it takes for entrepreneurs to navigate the licensing and permitting system to less than one day. The White House also announced the date for the first-ever White House Demo Day, which will bring together entrepreneurs from across the country to share their success stories. The initiative includes a Startup in a Day pledge, executive actions, and a federal-municipal partnership. Several cities have already committed to launching Startup in a Day solutions within 12 months. The SBA will provide funding and support for the development of online tools, and the National League of Cities will provide implementation support to Startup in a Day cities. The initiative is part of the Administration's efforts to eliminate obstacles to small business creation.
