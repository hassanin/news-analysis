The White House announced on July 6, 2009, that the United States and Russia had signed a new strategic framework for military-to-military engagement. This agreement would allow for the resumption of bilateral activities that had been suspended since August 2008. The new framework aimed to deepen mutual understanding and raise military cooperation to a new level between the two countries. The work plan for 2009 included nearly 20 exchanges and operational events, such as strategic discussions, joint exercises, and visits between military academies. The United States and Russia, as global powers, have a responsibility to ensure peace and stability in the world, and reestablishing military-to-military bonds would enhance transparency and communication.
