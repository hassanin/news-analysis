On World Refugee Day, the United States recognizes the courage and humanity of refugees and honors the generosity of communities welcoming them. With the global number of refugees reaching an alarming high of over 82 million, the US has a moral obligation to ensure access to life-saving care, education, and livelihoods for refugees. The US reaffirms its commitment to humanitarian relief and pursuing lasting solutions, including through resettlement. Protecting refugees is part of the nation's identity, as it was founded by those fleeing religious persecution. Assisting refugees not only aligns with American values but also brings regional stability and contributes to global safety. The US has revised its annual refugee admissions cap to 62,500 for this fiscal year and plans to raise it to 125,000 next year. The administration is working to rebuild and improve refugee processing and expand capacity to admit refugees. The arrival of refugees strengthens communities and brings new life and ideas to the country. The US aims to continue being a beacon of liberty and refuge to the world, fulfilling its role in providing safety and humanitarian relief.
