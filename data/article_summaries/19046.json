The White House has launched the 2011 Campus "Champions of Change" Challenge, inviting college and university students to demonstrate how their student-led projects are improving their campus community and helping America progress. The challenge will announce the top five champions in the spring of 2012 and host an event at the White House. MTV and mtvU will also highlight the finalists. Students can participate by submitting an online application with essay questions and optional videos/photos showcasing their project's impact. The deadline to submit applications is December 9, 2011. The public will have a chance to vote on the projects, and the top five finalists will be named Campus Champions of Change. These champions will have the opportunity to work with mtvU and MTV Act to create features about their projects that will be aired on mtvU and MTV.com. The Champions of Change program is part of President Obama's Winning the Future initiative, which recognizes individuals and groups making a positive impact in their communities.
