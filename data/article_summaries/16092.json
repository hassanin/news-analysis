Mexico, the United States, and Canada have agreed to work together, along with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to convert the fuel in Mexico's research reactor. The goal is to replace the highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel with low enriched uranium (LEU), thereby eliminating all remaining highly enriched uranium from Mexico. This trilateral partnership aims to prevent and suppress nuclear terrorism and reduce the risks associated with illicit trafficking of nuclear materials. The project is also a step towards the replacement of Mexico's research reactor with a new low-enriched uranium fuelled reactor in support of its nuclear energy development. This effort will be completed under the auspices of the IAEA and will strengthen nuclear security on the North American continent. The leaders of the three countries expressed their commitment to nuclear security and praised Mexico's leadership in this area, highlighting the importance of collective action in achieving concrete results.
