President Donald Trump has proclaimed April 2019 as Second Chance Month in the United States. The proclamation aims to draw attention to the challenges faced by former inmates and promote opportunities for them to successfully reintegrate into society. The high rates of recidivism in the country, where a majority of prisoners are rearrested within a few years of their release, have significant financial and social impacts. The bipartisan FIRST STEP Act, signed into law by President Trump, includes reforms such as increased access to education and vocational training for inmates, pilot mentorship programs, and adjustments to sentencing rules. The law also emphasizes the importance of maintaining family and community ties during incarceration. The proclamation acknowledges the role of faith-based organizations, community groups, and employers in reducing recidivism and calls on all Americans to raise public awareness about preventing crime and providing second chances to individuals who have completed their sentences.
