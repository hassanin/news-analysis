President Biden has declared a major disaster in Louisiana due to severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred from May 17 to May 21, 2021. This declaration allows federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts. Affected individuals in certain parishes can receive grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis statewide. John E. Long has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Residents and business owners in the designated parishes can apply for assistance online or by phone. Further information can be obtained from FEMA.
