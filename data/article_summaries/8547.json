The article discusses the importance of healthcare as a right rather than a privilege for all Americans. It highlights the progress made in increasing access and reducing costs for healthcare coverage. Since November 1st, 14.5 million Americans have enrolled in quality and affordable health coverage, with over 10 million enrolling through HealthCare.gov, marking the highest numbers in an open enrollment period. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows that one in seven previously uninsured Americans gained coverage between the end of 2020 and September 2021, with lower-income Americans experiencing the highest rate of coverage gain. The article attributes this progress to the American Rescue Plan, which has made quality coverage more affordable, resulting in an average annual premium savings of $2,400 for families. Additionally, four out of five consumers have found coverage for under $10 a month. The article encourages residents of California, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Washington, DC, to take advantage of the extended enrollment period until January 31st. The administration vows to continue fighting to lower costs and expand healthcare coverage, including through the Build Back Better agenda.
