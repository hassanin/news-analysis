President Obama will host the 2014 White House Tribal Nations Conference on December 3. The conference aims to provide leaders from the 566 federally recognized tribes the opportunity to interact with the President and members of the White House Council on Native American Affairs. Each tribe will be invited to send one representative to the conference. This conference will be the sixth of its kind for the Obama Administration and is part of the President's commitment to strengthen the government-to-government relationship with Indian Country and improve the lives of Native Americans. More information about the conference will be released at a later date.
