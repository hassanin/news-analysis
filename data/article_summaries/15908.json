President Barack Obama has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate, stating that the national emergency with respect to Lebanon, which was declared in Executive Order 13441 in 2007, will continue beyond August 1, 2016. The President cites ongoing activities, such as arms transfers to Hizballah, as a threat to national security and foreign policy, contributing to instability in the region. Therefore, he determines that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
