President Donald J. Trump spoke with NASA astronauts Peggy Whitson and Jack Fischer, congratulating them on their accomplishments and contributions to human space flight. Whitson broke the record for cumulative time spent in space by a U.S. astronaut and holds the women's record for longest time in orbit during a single spaceflight. Trump recognized Whitson for spending 665 total days in space, a new record for American astronauts. The President has taken steps to refocus NASA on its core mission of space exploration and supports the commercial space flight industry.
