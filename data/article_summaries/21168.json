Vice President Biden has announced staff changes in his office, with his longtime aide Annie Tomasini leaving at the end of the year to take a position at Harvard University. She will be replaced by Amy Dudley, who previously served as Delaware Senator Ted Kaufman's press secretary. Vice President Biden expressed his appreciation for Tomasini's contributions and wished her the best. Dudley, a former staff writer for The Hotline and press secretary for Senator Kaufman, will join the Vice President's communications office, which is led by Communications Director Jay Carney, Press Secretary Elizabeth Alexander, and Assistant Press Secretary Liz Allen.
