The article discusses the issue of childhood obesity in the United States and the steps being taken to address it. It highlights that nearly one in every three American children is overweight or obese, and certain racial and ethnic groups are disproportionately affected. Childhood obesity is attributed to factors such as unhealthy eating patterns and lack of physical activity at home and school. The article emphasizes that obesity can lead to severe health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and asthma, and imposes significant costs on families, the healthcare system, and the economy. The First Lady's initiative, "Let's Move!", and the Task Force on Childhood Obesity are mentioned as efforts to combat this issue. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is also noted for its provisions to address childhood obesity, such as mandatory coverage for screenings and counseling on nutrition and weight loss. The article encourages Americans to visit LetsMove.gov for more information and resources on promoting healthy eating and physical activity. The historical examples of successfully addressing public health issues, such as polio and childhood hunger, are cited as evidence that collective efforts can overcome obstacles. In conclusion, President Barack Obama proclaims September 2010 as National Childhood Obesity Awareness Month and calls on Americans to take action to promote healthy lifestyles for children.
