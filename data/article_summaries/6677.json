The Biden-Harris administration has unveiled its Africa strategy, which emphasizes the importance of Africa to U.S. national security interests. The strategy was developed through consultations and input from various stakeholders, including African embassies, partners, and think tanks. The strategy focuses on four main objectives: fostering openness and open societies, delivering democratic and security dividends, advancing pandemic recovery and economic opportunity, and supporting conservation, adaptation, and a just energy transition. The administration aims to engage with African partners, work collaboratively, and give Africans a seat at the table to shape the global response and address challenges. The strategy also acknowledges the growing influence of Russia and China in Africa and emphasizes the need for transparency and accountability in engagements with African countries. The administration plans to host the African Leaders Summit in December 2022 to further strengthen partnerships with African governments, institutions, and citizens. Concrete actions under the strategy include initiatives on trade, urban development, digital innovation, and support for democratic transitions and conflict resolution. The strategy also addresses concerns about Russia's involvement in Africa, particularly the role of private militia groups like the Wagner Group, and highlights the importance of supporting African youth in leadership roles. The administration aims to balance military cooperation with diplomatic efforts and focuses on addressing root causes of conflict and extremism. The strategy also considers African requests, such as increasing trade commitments and African representation at the UN Security Council.
