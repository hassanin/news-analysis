President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Washington and has ordered federal aid to assist in recovery efforts from wildfires and mudslides that occurred between August 9 and September 10, 2015. The funding will be available to state, tribal, and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures will also receive federal funding. Thomas J. Dargan has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments and state requests.
