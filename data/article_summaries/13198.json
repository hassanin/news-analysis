The article is a speech given by the President of the United States, Barack Obama, on the situation in Libya. He begins by expressing gratitude to the military and diplomats for their efforts in Libya, as well as acknowledging their work in Japan, Iraq, Afghanistan, and in the fight against Al-Qaeda. He explains that the intervention in Libya was necessary because the Libyan people were being oppressed by their leader, Muammar Gaddafi. The international community took action to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly zone. The President emphasizes that the United States is not acting alone, but is part of a coalition of allies, including European and Arab countries. He also addresses critics who question the need for intervention and those who advocate for regime change, stating that the focus is on protecting civilians and that a broader military mission would be a mistake. The President concludes by expressing support for the aspirations of the Libyan people and the importance of promoting freedom and dignity worldwide.
