Senior administration officials provided a briefing on the upcoming Afghan parliamentary elections. They mentioned that the deployment of additional resources announced by President Obama in December has been completed, and the security operations in Afghanistan are at their highest operational tempo. The briefing also touched on the monthly assessments of the President's strategy, which includes a focus on both the security and governing situation in Afghanistan. The officials highlighted that the upcoming parliamentary elections will be the first Afghan-led elections since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. They explained that there are just under 250 seats in the lower house of the parliament, all of which will be up for election. Preliminary results are expected within several days of the voting, but certified final results will likely take weeks and are not expected until October 30th. The officials acknowledged that there will be challenges, as there are 10 candidates for every seat, and the losers may potentially complain about the results. They also noted that the Taliban will likely try to intimidate voters and candidates and contest the election event itself. However, they expressed confidence in the progress made by the Afghan national security forces in securing the voting sites. The officials emphasized that the Afghan-run Independent Election Commission and Electoral Complaints Commission have implemented reforms to mitigate the risk of fraud. They mentioned that over 6,000 individuals involved in fraud in the previous elections have been barred from participating this time. They also highlighted administrative checks and improvements in monitoring and observation processes. The officials acknowledged the security challenges and the limited campaigning in some areas but expressed confidence in the Afghan forces' ability to handle the situation. They mentioned that there are international commissioners in the Electoral Complaints Commission to ensure transparency and accountability. Overall, they emphasized the commitment of the Afghan people to their democracy and the support of the international community in this process.
