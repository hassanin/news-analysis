In this press gaggle, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest addresses several topics. He begins by acknowledging that it is International Day of the Girl and discusses the Let Girls Learn initiative, which aims to provide education to adolescent girls around the world. Later in the day, First Lady Michelle Obama will participate in two events related to Let Girls Learn.

Earnest also discusses the recent announcement by the intelligence community that Russia was behind the hacking attempts on U.S. political organizations. He states that the U.S. will ensure a proportional response to Russia's actions, although specific response options are not disclosed.

Regarding President Obama's engagement with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Earnest notes that Russia is increasingly isolated from the international community due to their actions in Syria. He mentions that Russia cancelled a planned trip to France after French President Fran√ßois Hollande expressed concern about the violence in Syria. Earnest states that the U.S. will continue to engage with Russia in multilateral settings but is no longer pursuing a cessation of hostilities agreement due to Russia's inability to live up to their end of the deal.

Earnest also addresses questions about leaked emails and the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. He emphasizes that the investigation was conducted without political interference and that the Obama administration did not attempt to influence it.

Regarding the recent controversy surrounding Donald Trump's comments about women, Earnest states that President Obama found the tape repugnant and agrees with others who have described the comments as sexual assault. He also comments on the state of the Republican Party, suggesting that the party's focus on opposing Obama rather than advancing a conservative agenda has led to the current situation.

Earnest concludes by mentioning that President Obama will be holding a campaign event for Hillary Clinton in Greensboro, North Carolina. He states that the President is confident but not complacent about the election, and that he will continue to ramp up his campaign activities in the remaining four weeks before Election Day.
