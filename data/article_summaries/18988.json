President Obama met with VA Secretary Robert McDonald and Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson to discuss ongoing efforts to improve care for veterans. The President emphasized the need to strengthen management and accountability at the VA, improve timely access to high-quality medical care, eliminate the disability claims backlog, and end veteran homelessness. Secretary McDonald discussed his roadmap for his first 90 days as VA Secretary, which aims to improve service delivery, rebuild trust with veterans, and set the course for long-term reform. They also discussed the implementation of the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act, including the temporary Veterans Choice Program which allows eligible veterans to receive care from private health care providers. The importance of recruiting top medical professionals to serve veterans was also discussed, with Secretary McDonald hosting events at universities and colleges to reach future medical practitioners.
