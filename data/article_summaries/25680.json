First Lady Melania Trump held a virtual roundtable to discuss the foster care system in the United States and the Administration's efforts to support safe and permanent families for children and youth. The discussion included advocates for foster children, young adults who have been in foster care, foster parents, and representatives from foster care and adoption organizations. The roundtable focused on increasing partnerships, resources, and transparency in the foster care system, especially given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on foster children and families. Participants shared personal experiences with the system and discussed lessons from the pandemic, innovations in child placement, trauma-informed training, and the importance of a loving family for each individual. The First Lady thanked everyone for their advocacy and emphasized her commitment to the issue, encouraging continued collaboration with the Administration to ensure the well-being of all children.
