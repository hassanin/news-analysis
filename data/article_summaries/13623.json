President Barack Obama has proclaimed May 2014 as National Building Safety Month. The proclamation recognizes the importance of buildings in our society and the professionals who work to keep them secure. The government has encouraged partnerships between the public and private sectors to develop new guidance and tools for increasing disaster-resistance and meeting building standards. The proclamation also calls on citizens, government agencies, businesses, nonprofits, and other interested groups to raise awareness about building safety and learn how they can contribute to building safety at home and in their communities.
