The article discusses a proclamation made by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. regarding the adjustment of imports of steel articles into the United States. The Secretary of Commerce conducted an investigation and found that steel articles imported into the US threaten national security. The President concurred with this finding and imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel articles imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico. However, the United States has reached an agreement with the United Kingdom (UK) to address the national security concerns posed by steel imports. The agreement includes measures such as a tariff-rate quota and cooperation on trade remedies and customs matters. As a result, imports of specified volumes of eligible steel articles from the UK will no longer threaten national security and will be excluded from the tariff. The UK is considered a special case due to the unique relationship between the US and the UK. The proclamation also contains details on the modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States and the provisions for other countries.
