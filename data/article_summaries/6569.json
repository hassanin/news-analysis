The President expresses disappointment with OPEC+'s decision to cut production quotas amid the negative impact of Putin's invasion of Ukraine. This decision will particularly affect lower- and middle-income countries already struggling with high energy prices. The President has taken steps to lower gas prices in the US, including releasing 10 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and directing the Department of Energy to explore ways to increase domestic production. The President also calls on US energy companies to close the gap between wholesale and retail gas prices. The Biden Administration will consult with Congress on reducing OPEC's control over energy prices and emphasizes the need for the US to reduce reliance on foreign fossil fuels. The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act allows for significant investment in clean energy and technology to enhance energy security.
