The article discusses the expiration of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act's (BFDA) ban on imports from Burma and the actions taken by President Obama in response. The President issued an Executive Order repealing the provisions of Executive Order 13310 that implemented the import ban on products from Burma. This move is in line with the administration's policy of promoting responsible economic engagement and encouraging reform that benefits the Burmese people. However, due to concerns regarding labor and human rights, the Executive Order reinstates restrictions on the importation of jadeite and rubies mined or extracted from Burma, as well as articles of jewelry containing them. The administration is also maintaining restrictions on activities and actors that contribute to human rights abuses or undermine Burma's democratic reform process. The announcement signifies a broader American engagement in Burma, including increased opportunities for trade and investment, development assistance, and support for political reform and national reconciliation.
