The White House is set to launch a national biotechnology and biomanufacturing initiative, with President Biden signing an executive order tomorrow. The initiative aims to drive federal investments in biotechnology to boost U.S. economic competitiveness and make the country more prosperous. The global biotechnology industry is expected to revolutionize manufacturing industries, with the potential to account for more than one third of global output by the end of the decade. The initiative will focus on research and development, domestic biomanufacturing capacity, biosecurity innovation, workforce training, and education programs. It also aims to create robust markets for bio-based products and address climate change. The executive order will be accompanied by significant investments, although specific figures have not been disclosed yet. The initiative is part of President Biden's agenda to ensure U.S. leadership in biotechnology and maintain national security.
