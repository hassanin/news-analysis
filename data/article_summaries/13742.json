The President emphasizes the importance of supporting crime victims and reaffirms their right to live free from violence. He acknowledges that while progress has been made in reducing crime rates, millions of people continue to be victimized each year. The President highlights the need to provide rights, services, and support for all victims, particularly underserved populations. He mentions the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which includes provisions to assist immigrants, Native American communities, and victims facing discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
