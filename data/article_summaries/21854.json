This memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama in 2014, addresses the issue of Icelandic whaling and the trade in whale meat and products. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell had previously certified that Iceland's trade in whale parts and products diminishes the effectiveness of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In response, the President directs relevant departments and agencies to raise concerns with Iceland's trade in appropriate international forums and seek additional measures to reduce such trade. He also instructs senior Administration officials to raise objections to commercial whaling with Icelandic officials and urge a halt to such action. The President further calls for efforts to encourage Iceland to develop nonlethal uses of whales, such as responsible whale watching activities and scientific research, and to re-examine bilateral cooperation projects based on Iceland's whaling policy. The Department of State is tasked with informing Iceland that the United States will continue to monitor Icelandic companies engaged in commercial whaling and trade in whale parts. Cabinet secretaries and senior officials are also instructed to evaluate the appropriateness of visits to Iceland in light of its whaling activities. Finally, the memorandum directs relevant departments and agencies to explore other options for responding to Iceland's continued whaling. The President expects progress on these actions within 6 months and requests reports from departments and agencies through the Departments of State, Commerce, and the Interior. The memorandum emphasizes the need to encourage Iceland to halt commercial whaling and support international conservation efforts.
