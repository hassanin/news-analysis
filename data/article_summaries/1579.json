In a COVID Response update, Acting Administrator Andy Slavitt and Dr. Rochelle Walensky provided an update on the pandemic. Slavitt highlighted the efforts to vaccinate the most at-risk populations, such as the elderly, healthcare workers, and essential workers. He also emphasized the need to increase vaccinations in racial and ethnic communities that have been disproportionately affected. Slavitt mentioned that the nation's efforts are focused on increasing vaccine supply, creating more vaccination centers, and mobilizing more vaccinators. He also mentioned the importance of the American Rescue Plan in further increasing vaccination efforts. Dr. Walensky provided an update on COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. While cases and hospital admissions have been declining, hospitalizations remain high. She also emphasized the importance of continuing to follow mitigation measures and getting vaccinated. Dr. Anthony Fauci addressed the question of whether only one dose of the vaccine would be sufficient. He explained that while a single dose does provide some protection, the second dose is necessary for a stronger and broader response, especially against variants. He also emphasized the importance of vaccinating as many people as possible to prevent the spread and evolution of variants. During the Q&A session, they discussed topics such as the number of variant cases, the potential effectiveness of vaccines against variants, the relaxation of protocols by some states, and the upcoming CDC guidelines for school reopenings. They also highlighted the ongoing communication and collaboration with governors to address these issues.
