The Biden-Harris Administration has released its first-ever national strategy dedicated to the Pacific Islands. The strategy aims to strengthen ties between the United States and the Pacific Islands, promote unity and connectivity among the Pacific Islands region, address climate change and other challenges, and empower the people of the Pacific Islands through trade, investment, education, and development opportunities. The strategy aligns with the Indo-Pacific Strategy of the United States and the goals of the Pacific Island Forum's 2050 Strategy.
