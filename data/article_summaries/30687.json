The United States has commended the government of Lebanon for its progress in addressing challenges such as an influx of refugees and the influence of Iran and Hezbollah. Lebanon has passed budgets for two consecutive years, increased its armed forces deployments, and defeated ISIS. The country is also planning to strengthen its economy through its Capital Investment Plan and reforms to combat corruption, increase transparency, and improve accountability and fiscal management. The United States supports Lebanon's efforts to strengthen its state institutions and develop an open, free economy. American companies are looking forward to the opportunities that the Capital Investment Plan will bring.
