The article discusses the benefits of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) for Iowa's agriculture industry. The author, Under Secretary Bill Northey, states that USMCA is a better and improved agreement compared to the previous North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Iowa, being a major producer of corn, soybeans, pork, and eggs, will benefit from the agreement as it maintains and strengthens markets for these products, especially with Mexico. USMCA also addresses agricultural biotechnology, provides access for dairy farmers into Canada, updates rules for processed fruits, and maintains tariff-free access for beef. The author urges members of Congress to pass USMCA after the August recess.
