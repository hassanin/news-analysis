President Biden visited Lake Charles, Louisiana, to discuss his American Jobs Plan and the need for infrastructure investment. He highlighted the importance of rebuilding America's infrastructure in a way that is resilient to climate change and creates good-paying jobs. The President emphasized that infrastructure investment is not just about fixing roads and bridges, but also about investing in clean energy, modernizing schools and hospitals, and expanding broadband access. He outlined his plan to pay for these investments by raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy, while ensuring that hardworking middle-class families are not burdened. The President stressed the importance of bipartisan cooperation and expressed his willingness to compromise, but also made it clear that he is not willing to do nothing and that America needs to act now to rebuild and create a more competitive future.
