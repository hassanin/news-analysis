During a press gaggle aboard Air Force One en route to La Crosse, Wisconsin, Eric Schultz, the White House Deputy Press Secretary, discussed President Obama's proposal to extend overtime pay to nearly 5 million workers earning less than about $50,440. Schultz mentioned that the proposed rule would help promote higher take-home pay and allow workers to better balance their work and family obligations. The President also plans to discuss other efforts to help working families, such as increasing the minimum wage and expanding access to paid leave. Schultz highlighted the contrast between the President's approach and the policies promoted by Republicans, who want to roll back these efforts. Schultz also mentioned that the President will meet with the Governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker, on the tarmac upon arrival. The President will make an argument for middle-class economics and discuss the importance of fairness and a level playing field for American workers and companies. Schultz also discussed the recent BP settlement, stating that it would help repair the damage done to the local economies of the Gulf and ensure that the region remains economically important. He did not comment on whether the settlement was enough. Schultz also mentioned that the President's focus is on the last 18 months of his presidency and the economic progress that has been made. He did not provide any specific reactions to the Hillary Clinton emails or the situation at the Navy Yard. Schultz stated that the P5+1 coalition remains united in negotiations with Iran and that there are still complicated issues to be resolved. He did not provide any new information on July 4th security preparations or foreign leader calls.
