On January 18, 2016, the President and First Lady, along with Cabinet Secretaries and other Senior Administration Officials, participated in community service projects and events to honor Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service. The President and First Lady volunteered at Leckie Elementary School in Washington, D.C., where they assembled a garden bed, planted vegetable seeds, and packed bags with books for those in need. Cabinet Members and Senior Administration Officials also participated in service events in various locations across the country. Some of the projects included painting murals, collecting and sorting food and clothing items, and cleaning up parks. The day was an opportunity for Americans to come together and meet the needs of their communities while re-committing to service throughout the year.
