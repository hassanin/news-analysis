President Obama and APEC Leaders have agreed to intensify their efforts in combatting corruption and bribery across the Asia-Pacific region. They have encouraged APEC Member Economies to enhance cross-border cooperation in fighting public corruption, business bribery, money laundering, and illicit trade. To support these actions, a new network of anticorruption authorities and law enforcement agencies (ACT-NET) will be created. APEC Leaders have also adopted the APEC Principles on the Prevention of Bribery and Enforcement of Anti-Bribery Laws, as well as the APEC General Elements of Effective Voluntary Corporate Compliance Programs. These principles aim to prevent bribery, improve the enforcement of bribery laws, and promote ethical business environments for small and medium enterprises. The United States, through the enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), is taking a firm stand against public corruption both domestically and internationally. The U.S. Government continues to prioritize the prevention and prosecution of corruption to preserve public funds, drive development and economic growth, and maintain national security. The United States has also been a leader in developing international legal frameworks and providing funding for capacity building to fight corruption globally.
