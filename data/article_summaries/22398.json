The article discusses the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Côte d'Ivoire. The situation in Côte d'Ivoire, which has resulted in the massacre of civilians, human rights abuses, political violence, and attacks against peacekeeping forces, has been addressed by the United Nations Security Council. Although progress has been made in terms of democratic freedoms and economic development since President Alassane Ouattara took office, the situation still poses a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
