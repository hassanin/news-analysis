President Barack Obama has proclaimed September as National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among American men, with over 230,000 expected to be diagnosed this year. The mortality rate for prostate cancer has fallen since the mid-1990s, but it still remains a significant threat, with an estimated 29,000 men expected to die from the disease this year. Increased awareness is important in helping men make informed choices about their health. The exact causes of prostate cancer are still unknown, but there are well-established risk factors such as age, family history, and race. The Obama Administration continues to invest in research to prevent and treat prostate cancer, with a focus on reducing side effects and understanding the impact on African-American men. The Affordable Care Act provides more options for quality, affordable health coverage, and protections against denial of coverage due to pre-existing conditions. The proclamation encourages citizens, government agencies, private businesses, non-profit organizations, and other groups to participate in activities that increase awareness and prevention of prostate cancer.
