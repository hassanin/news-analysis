The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attack at a mosque in Egypt's North Sinai province. They offer condolences to the families of the victims and stand with the people and government of Egypt against terrorism. They emphasize that there should be no tolerance for groups that claim to act in the name of a faith but attack places of worship and kill innocent people. The international community must continue to work together to defeat terrorist groups and discredit their extremist ideology.
