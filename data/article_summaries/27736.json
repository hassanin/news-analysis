On September 4, 2018, the President signed into law the "Pro bono Work to Empower and Represent Act of 2018" or the "POWER Act." This new law requires the chief judge of each judicial district to hold a public event at least once a year to promote pro bono legal services for survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. The goal is to empower these survivors and provide them with the necessary legal support.
