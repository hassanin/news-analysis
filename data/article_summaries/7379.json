The Small Business Administration (SBA) has announced several reforms to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) in order to provide more targeted relief to small businesses, particularly those that have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Biden-Harris administration aims to extend resources to help small businesses survive, reopen, and rebuild. The reforms include:

1. A two-week exclusive application period for businesses with fewer than 20 employees, allowing them to have sole access to PPP funds.
2. Revisions to the program's funding formula, which will better cater to sole proprietors, independent contractors, and self-employed individuals.
3. Increased support for minority-owned businesses by setting aside $1 billion specifically for these businesses and their access to the PPP.
4. Elimination of restrictions that prevented small business owners with prior non-fraud felony convictions or those who are delinquent on their federal student loans from receiving PPP loans.
5. The inclusion of non-citizen small business owners who are lawful U.S. residents in the eligibility criteria for PPP loans.

Furthermore, the Biden-Harris administration is committed to ensuring an equitable distribution of relief by implementing measures to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse. They will strengthen oversight and provide clear guidance to lenders to ensure that taxpayer dollars are utilized effectively and efficiently. These reforms aim to address the challenges faced by small businesses, especially those owned by Black and Brown individuals, and help them recover from the economic impacts of the pandemic.
