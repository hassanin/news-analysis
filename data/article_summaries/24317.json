The United States is committed to working with African countries to address peace and security challenges on the continent. They are expanding their cooperation with governments in Africa to combat terrorism and violent extremism, and are providing funding and assistance to support counterterrorism and security initiatives throughout Africa. They are also engaging in programs that promote dialogue, trust, and partnerships between security forces, law enforcement actors, government officials, community leaders, and civil society. In addition, the United States is working to build African peacekeeping capacity and save lives through the African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership (APRRP), which aims to rapidly deploy peacekeepers in response to emerging conflicts. They are also implementing other commitments, such as the Early Warning and Response Partnership (EWARP) and the Security Governance Initiative (SGI), to improve conflict prevention, crisis management, and security sector governance in Africa.
