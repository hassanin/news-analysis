The Biden administration is planning to distribute at-home COVID-19 rapid tests to the American people for free. The tests will be available for online ordering and distribution, with 500 million tests being made available. Testing is considered a critical tool to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19, and at-home rapid tests are recommended in situations such as experiencing symptoms, close contact with someone who has COVID-19, or gathering indoors with at-risk or unvaccinated individuals. Health insurance will cover the cost of at-home tests starting from tomorrow. The administration has taken significant action to expand testing capacity, including streamlining the FDA authorization process and increasing manufacturing. The U.S. is conducting more lab-based tests per capita than many other countries. The website for ordering the free tests will be live on January 19th, with tests typically shipping within 7 to 12 days. The program will limit the number of tests sent to each residential address to four, but there are other ways to access tests, such as through pharmacies and free testing sites. The administration is working to ensure that the program reaches hard-hit and high-risk communities, including communities of color and people with disabilities. The cost of purchasing and distributing the 1 billion tests is estimated to be around $4 billion, and the administration is committed to expanding testing further if needed. The tests have been tested for their accuracy in detecting the Omicron variant.
