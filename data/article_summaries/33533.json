President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Georgia and ordered Federal aid to supplement State, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by Hurricane Michael. Federal funding will be available to affected individuals in certain counties for temporary housing, home repairs, and low-cost loans for uninsured property losses. State, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, can also receive federal funding for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures. Manny J. Toro has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week until further notice. For more information, media should contact the FEMA News Desk.
