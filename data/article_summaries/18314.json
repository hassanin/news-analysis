President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama extend their best wishes to those celebrating Kwanzaa. They acknowledge the week-long celebration of African American culture and highlight Kwanzaa's seven principles: unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith. The Obamas emphasize that these principles not only define the essence of the holiday but also represent shared values that unite Americans. They hope for a prosperous and healthy new year as families and communities come together to light the Kinara.
