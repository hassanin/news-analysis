Senior Administration officials, including Commerce Secretary Raimondo, Deputy Defense Secretary Hicks, National Security Advisor Sullivan, and National Science Foundation Director Panchanathan, held a briefing with Members of Congress to discuss the need to invest in American-made semiconductors and research and development for economic and national security protection. They highlighted that the US currently produces only 12% of global semiconductor output due to decades of disinvestment, making the country vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. A significant interruption in semiconductor supply could cause severe damage to the US economy and undermine technological competitiveness and military advantages. The House and Senate have passed bills to invest in research, domestic manufacturing, and semiconductor production, including $52 billion in new funding authorized in the CHIPS Act. These investments are crucial for economic resilience and national security. The officials urged Congress to quickly pass legislation and send it to the President for his signature.
