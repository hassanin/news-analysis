They emphasized the need for continued preventive measures, such as mask-wearing, physical distancing, handwashing, and improved ventilation, especially during the holiday season. The press conference concluded with a reminder to follow travel restrictions and protocols for international travel. Overall, the officials stressed the importance of individual actions in protecting oneself and others from COVID-19.
