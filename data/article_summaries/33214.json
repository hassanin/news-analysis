President Donald Trump delivered remarks at the American Legion's 99th National Convention and signed the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. He praised the sacrifices made by veterans and emphasized the need for unity in overcoming challenges. The American Legion, a veterans' organization, played a role in passing the Forever GI Bill and advocates for veterans. The recently-signed legislation aims to streamline the process for veterans appealing their disability benefits claims, reducing waiting times and providing timely updates. Various veterans' organizations supported and worked with the Trump Administration on this legislation.
