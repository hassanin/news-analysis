The Bureau of Labor Statistics' May Employment Situation report shows that the US economy added 2.5 million jobs last month and the unemployment rate fell from 14.7% to 13.3%. The job gains were in sectors such as leisure and hospitality, construction, education and health services, retail trade, and manufacturing. These job gains surprised forecasters, as many states were only beginning to reopen their economies during the survey reference periods. A poll conducted in April showed that the majority of laid-off workers expected to be rehired by their most recent employers once stay-at-home orders were lifted, and this survey result is reflected in May's employment data. The report also highlights that there were 15.3 million people on temporary layoff in May, with an additional 4.9 million people temporarily out of work but still counted as employed. The increase in average weekly hours worked suggests pent-up demand, which could lead to further job growth. Despite the positive job gains, initial Unemployment Insurance claims remain elevated. However, the number of people receiving UI has declined, indicating that laid-off Americans are returning to work. The report also notes that there was not an elevated level of workers dropping out of the labor force, and other indicators of labor market strength, such as gasoline demand and workplace visits, have been recovering. While the May jobs report is positive, there is still room for growth, as the unemployment rate is still higher than before the pandemic. However, with more states easing restrictions, strong attachments between laid-off workers and their employers, and growing labor demand, it is expected that the American economy will add even more jobs in June.
