She emphasized that the plan will provide much-needed relief to American families and small businesses, particularly those in hard-hit areas and minority-owned businesses. Harris also highlighted the plan's provisions for childcare, unemployment benefits, housing assistance, and healthcare. She acknowledged the challenges faced by essential workers and the importance of equitable vaccine distribution. Harris urged the group to continue advocating for systemic improvements and to strive for a better future, rather than simply returning to normal. She closed by thanking the leaders for their commitment and expressing optimism for the future.
