President Donald J. Trump has declared a state of emergency in the U.S. Virgin Islands due to the emergency conditions caused by Hurricane Maria. This declaration authorizes the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to coordinate disaster relief efforts. The aim is to provide assistance to the local population and take necessary emergency measures to save lives, protect property, and ensure public health and safety. FEMA is authorized to provide equipment and resources to alleviate the impacts of the emergency, including debris removal and emergency protective measures. These efforts will be funded by the federal government at a rate of 75 percent. William L. Vogel has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas.
