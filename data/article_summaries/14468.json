President Obama has announced a plan to expand wireless access in the United States, with the goal of reaching 98% of Americans. The plan includes freeing up spectrum through incentive auctions, investing in research and development of emerging wireless technologies, and creating a nationwide, interoperable wireless network for public safety. The initiative is expected to reduce the national deficit by nearly $10 billion. The President made the announcement at Northern Michigan University, where local businesses have benefited from broadband access and the university's WiMAX network has enabled distance learning. The plan also includes a $5 billion investment to ensure that rural areas have access to high-speed wireless services. Additionally, the President proposed a $3 billion Wireless Innovation Fund to support research and development in areas such as public safety, education, energy, health, transportation, and economic development. The President's plan aims to cut the deficit by $9.6 billion over the next decade through spectrum auctions. The Administration has already made progress in expanding broadband access through investments from the Commerce and Agriculture Departments.
