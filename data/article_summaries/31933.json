Lighthizer and Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin from the United States, and Vice Premier Liu He from China. The delegations had the opportunity to meet with President Xi Jinping to discuss their discussions. The talks focused on various issues, including forced technology transfer, intellectual property rights, cyber theft, agriculture, services, non-tariff barriers, and currency.
