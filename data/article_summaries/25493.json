This executive order, issued by President Donald Trump on April 25, 2017, aims to promote agriculture and rural prosperity in America. It establishes the Interagency Task Force on Agriculture and Rural Prosperity, which includes various government officials from different departments. The task force is responsible for identifying legislative, regulatory, and policy changes to enhance agriculture, economic development, job growth, infrastructure improvements, technological innovation, energy security, and quality of life in rural communities. The task force will also coordinate with other reviews of regulations and policies. Within 180 days, the Secretary of Agriculture, in coordination with the task force, is required to submit a report to the President recommending changes that the task force considers appropriate. This executive order revokes a previous executive order related to rural development. It is important to note that this order does not impair the authority of executive departments or agencies, and its implementation is subject to applicable law and available appropriations.
