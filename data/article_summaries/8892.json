The article is a memorandum from President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to the Secretary of State regarding the determination with respect to the efforts of foreign governments regarding trafficking in persons. The memorandum outlines the actions that will be taken by the United States government in relation to various countries. It states that the United States will not provide nonhumanitarian, nontrade-related assistance to certain governments until they comply with the minimum standards outlined in the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. The memorandum also instructs the United States Executive Director of each multilateral development bank to vote against any loan or utilization of funds for these governments. It further states that certain countries will receive a partial waiver of restrictions for specific types of assistance if it is deemed to be in the national interest of the United States. The memorandum also addresses the Governments of Curacao and Sint Maarten, directing that certain actions be taken against them until they comply with the minimum standards or make significant efforts to do so. The memorandum concludes by authorizing the submission of this determination to Congress and its publication in the Federal Register.
