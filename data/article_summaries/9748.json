The article discusses the APEC Leaders' agreement to explore pathways to achieve a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP). They believe that trade and investment liberalization and facilitation are essential for APEC's core objective and that regional economic integration is crucial for achieving this goal. They state that now is the time to translate FTAAP from an aspirational to a more concrete vision and instruct APEC to take concrete steps towards its realization. They emphasize that an FTAAP should be comprehensive, high-quality, and address "next generation" trade and investment issues. The article also mentions that APEC should contribute to the pursuit of an FTAAP by continuing its work on sectoral initiatives such as investment, services, e-commerce, and trade facilitation. They also highlight the importance of considering the changing global economic and trade architecture, the progress towards achieving free and open regional trade and investment, the non-binding nature of APEC, and the support for the multilateral trading system. APEC aims to create a more economically integrated community where goods, services, and business people can move seamlessly across borders. They also emphasize the importance of providing economic and technical cooperation activities to help APEC members, particularly developing economies, improve their capacity for trade and investment liberalization and facilitation.
