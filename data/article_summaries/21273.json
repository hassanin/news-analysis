All 28 NATO members have decided to extend NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen's tenure for an additional year, through 2014. President Obama welcomes this decision and commends Rasmussen for his strong leadership of the security alliance. The United States looks forward to continuing to work with him and NATO allies and partners to strengthen and revitalize NATO for the 21st century. Rasmussen will lead the Alliance in fulfilling commitments made at the Chicago Summit, including transitioning in Afghanistan, reshaping alliance capabilities, and advancing opportunities for global partners to cooperate with NATO.
