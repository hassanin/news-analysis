According to the article, Americans are returning to work at a record pace, resulting in the lowest number of Americans on unemployment insurance since 1970. The number of new claims for unemployment insurance has also dropped to its lowest level since 1969. This progress is attributed to an economic strategy focused on growing the economy from the bottom up and middle out, starting with the American Rescue Plan. Effective management of pandemic resources has led to a high vaccination rate and the reopening of 99% of schools. While there is still work to be done in reducing costs for families, the article suggests that the US economy is well-equipped to handle the challenge of inflation. The government plans to lower costs by promoting domestic production, rebuilding supply chains, addressing long-standing cost issues, and ensuring competition in markets to protect consumers.
