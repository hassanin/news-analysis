The United States has praised South Africa for taking steps to restore market access for US poultry, pork, and beef products. The two countries have collaborated to address concerns, and as a result, South Africa has met all the requirements to remain eligible for African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) benefits. The President has issued a proclamation revoking the impending suspension of these benefits. The US and South Africa are committed to strong economic growth and opportunities for their citizens, and they intend to continue working together to enhance their trade and investment relationship.
