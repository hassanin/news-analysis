Vice President Joe Biden expresses his support for the Solidarity Sabbath Initiative, which aims to mobilize leaders worldwide to oppose anti-Semitism and ensure the security of Jewish communities. He highlights recent attacks on Jews in various locations and emphasizes the persistence of anti-Semitism in many places. Biden believes that the denunciation of Jews has been excused as political critique, and too many leaders have remained silent or even supported bigotry and violence against Jewish communities. The Solidarity Sabbath initiative encourages leaders, ambassadors, and government officials in over twenty countries to attend services at local synagogues to demonstrate their solidarity and opposition to hatred. Biden shares his personal experiences of learning about the viciousness of anti-Semitism from his father and Tom Lantos, the only Holocaust survivor to serve in the US Congress. He highlights that unchecked anti-Semitism not only threatens Jews but entire societies. Biden concludes by extending a peaceful Sabbath greeting to those observing the Solidarity Sabbath around the world.
