On Holocaust Remembrance Day, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation honoring the victims of Nazi persecution and reflecting on the Holocaust. He acknowledged the 75th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, where Polish Jews resisted their Nazi captors. The Holocaust, also known as the Shoah, was the result of the Nazi regime's attempt to eradicate the Jewish population in Europe. The President condemned the brutality of the Nazis and the failure of Western leaders to confront them early on, which led to the persecution and murder of millions of people, including Jews, Roma, disabled individuals, and other minorities. Trump called on Americans to remember the lives lost, pay tribute to those who resisted the Nazis, and learn from the Holocaust to prevent such atrocities in the future. He asked the people of the United States to observe the Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust, April 12-19, 2018, through appropriate study, prayers, and commemoration.
