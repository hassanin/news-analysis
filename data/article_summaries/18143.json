President Obama expresses his disappointment in the unanimous Republican blockade in the Senate of the DISCLOSE Act, a piece of legislation aimed at controlling the influx of special interest money in elections. He believes that this decision allows special interests and U.S. corporations, including foreign-controlled ones, to spend unlimited money on campaign advertisements without disclosing their financing. President Obama argues that this victory for special interests comes at the expense of the American people, as they no longer have the right to know who is financing these ads. He warns that this decision brings us closer to a time when lobbyists wrote the laws and special interests controlled Congress. Despite this setback, President Obama pledges to continue fighting to keep democracy in the hands of the American people.
