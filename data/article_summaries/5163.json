President Biden addressed the public after his recent overseas trip, where he attended the United Nations Climate Conference, met with leaders of ASEAN countries and Indo-Pacific allies, and participated in meetings with G20 leaders. He emphasized the strength of the American economy and the impact of legislative achievements such as the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, and CHIPS and Science Act. The President highlighted the positive effects of these achievements, including job growth, decreasing inflation at the grocery store, lower prices for goods like clothes and appliances, and reduced gas prices. He also discussed upcoming benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act, such as lowered costs for prescription insulin for seniors with diabetes on Medicare and free recommended vaccines for seniors on Medicare Part D. Additionally, the President mentioned the extension of lower rates for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act and tax credits for making homes more energy-efficient, including installing solar panels and heat pumps. He emphasized the financial and environmental benefits of these initiatives. President Biden expressed his commitment to listening to labor and business leaders and working together to strengthen the American economy. The meeting was then handed over to Brian Deese, Director of the National Economic Council.
