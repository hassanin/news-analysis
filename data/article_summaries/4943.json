Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland and Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice held the first meeting of the White House Council on Native American Affairs in the Biden-Harris Administration. The Council will work on issues such as climate change, Tribal homelands and treaties, economic development, energy and infrastructure, health, education, public safety and justice, and international Indigenous issues. Ten Cabinet Secretaries and other government officials discussed strengthening the Nation-to-Nation relationship, improving tribal consultation, and formalizing the working committees of the Council. The White House also announced a Tribal Leaders Summit in late 2021, where leaders from federally recognized Tribal Nations can interact directly with the President and high-level Administration representatives. The Council was established in 2013 but was inactive during the previous administration. President Biden reinstated it within his first 100 days in office. Participants in the virtual meeting included agency leadership and senior White House officials.
