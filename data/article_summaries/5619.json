President Biden and Australian Prime Minister Albanese met in San Diego to discuss their countries' alliance and the recent AUKUS agreement. They emphasized their shared commitment to joint security efforts and expanding the maritime domain of democracies. They also discussed climate change, regional stability, and economic coercion. President Biden clarified that the agreement is about nuclear power, not nuclear weapons, and that it has been approved by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Prime Minister Albanese expressed gratitude for the leadership shown by the Biden administration and highlighted the economic benefits of the agreement. The leaders also mentioned their upcoming meetings and visits, including the Quad meeting in Australia and the hosting of APEC by the United States. The press asked about the sustainability of AUKUS and the choice of Australia as a partner, to which President Biden affirmed Australia's reliability and humorously stated that he didn't ask to borrow any money.
