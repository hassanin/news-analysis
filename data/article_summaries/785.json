President Biden has issued a Presidential Determination pursuant to Section 303 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended. The determination states that airbreathing engines, advanced avionics position navigation and guidance systems, and constituent materials for hypersonic systems are essential to national defense. It also acknowledges that without Presidential action, the United States industry cannot be expected to provide the necessary investment for these capabilities in a timely manner. Therefore, the President has determined that purchases, purchase commitments, or other actions under Section 303 of the Act are the most cost-effective and practical method for meeting this critical production capability. The determination also waives certain requirements of the Act to expand domestic production capability for these supply chains, citing the need to avert a shortfall that would severely impair national defense capability. The Secretary of Defense is authorized and directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
