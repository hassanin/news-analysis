The United States condemns the ongoing air assault by Syrian government forces on civilians, including the use of SCUD missiles and barrel bombs in and around Aleppo. Over the weekend, more than 300 people, including children, were killed in these attacks. The Syrian government is urged to fulfill its obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance. A comprehensive political solution is needed to end the crisis in Syria, and the United States is committed to advancing this settlement.
