The US government has announced that it has authorized and recommended an updated COVID-19 vaccine for everyone aged 6 months and older. This means that there are now immunizations available for all three major seasonal respiratory viruses: COVID-19, flu, and RSV. The government is urging all Americans to stay up-to-date on their vaccines as vaccination against COVID-19 remains the most important protection against serious illness, hospitalization, and death.
