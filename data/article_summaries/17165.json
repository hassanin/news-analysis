In a statement regarding the January employment report, Christina Romer, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, acknowledges that while unemployment remains a severe problem, there are encouraging signs of gradual labor market healing. The unemployment rate fell from 10.0 percent to 9.7 percent, despite a modest rise in the labor force. The broadest measure of the unemployment rate, which includes all persons marginally attached to the labor force and workers working part-time for economic reasons, also declined. However, the unemployment rate is still unacceptably high, particularly for certain demographic groups such as teenagers and black or African American workers. Overall payroll employment declined by 20,000 in December, with variations across industries. Manufacturing employment rose for the first time since January 2007, while employment in construction and state and local government declined. The statement also highlights the need for continued efforts to move in the right direction and replace job losses with robust job gains.
