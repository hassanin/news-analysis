Vice President Joe Biden has announced the reopening of a former GM factory in Wilmington, Delaware, by Fisker Automotive. The factory will produce long-range, plug-in, electric hybrid vehicles as part of the administration's commitment to jumpstart the production of fuel-efficient vehicles in America. Fisker Automotive selected the Wilmington assembly plant for its primary global production facility based on its size, production capacity, and access to shipping ports, rail lines, and skilled workforce. The Department of Energy has provided a $528.7 million conditional loan to Fisker Automotive, with $359 million going towards reviving manufacturing at the Boxwood Plant in Delaware. The plant will support Fisker Automotive's Project NINA, the development and build of a mass-market plug-in hybrid sedan. The company aims to build 75,000-100,000 of these vehicles every year by 2014. The remaining loan amount will support engineering integration in Michigan and California, as well as the development of manufacturing processes for the Wilmington facility. This announcement is seen as a testament to the efforts to create new jobs, invest in a clean energy economy, and reduce carbon pollution. The Fisker loan is the fourth conditional loan commitment made by the Department of Energy under the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) loan program. The Department plans to make additional loans under this program to auto manufacturers and parts suppliers in the coming months. Additionally, plug-in hybrids and other electric vehicles will play a role in the smart grid infrastructure being developed in the United States, allowing for charging during times of low electricity demand and utilizing renewable resources.
