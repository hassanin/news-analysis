The White House strongly condemns the terrorist attack in Hilla, Iraq, which killed at least 80 people and injured many more. The attack targeted pilgrims, including Iranians, who were returning from a religious observance. The United States extends its sympathies to the victims' families and to Iraq. The attack was intended to fuel sectarian tensions, but the United States remains committed to its partnership with Iraq and is determined to defeat ISIL.
