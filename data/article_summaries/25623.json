The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is holding its first National Leadership Summit on Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in Washington, D.C. The summit brings together representatives from over 35 states, federal partners, tribes, industry groups, and other organizations to discuss how the EPA should handle PFAS in communities and communicate associated risks. PFAS are man-made chemicals with stain-resistant, waterproof, and nonstick properties that have been widely used since the 1940s. However, concerns have been raised about their presence in the environment and potential health risks. States like Michigan, New York, West Virginia, and North Carolina have found PFAS in their drinking water, prompting calls for action from the EPA. The EPA has issued health advisories for certain PFAS chemicals and is developing toxicity values for others. They are also planning to meet with affected communities and draft a National PFAS Management Plan. These actions demonstrate the EPA's commitment to protecting public health and ensuring clean and safe drinking water for all Americans.
