President Biden is traveling to Baltimore to kick off a major infrastructure project funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The project aims to replace the 150-year old Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel, which is the largest rail bottleneck on the Northeast Corridor between Washington, D.C. and New Jersey. The new tunnel will create 30,000 jobs, improve reliability, lower commuting times, and enhance safety and resilience. The project is expected to cost approximately $6 billion, with $4.7 billion coming from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The new tunnel will be named after Frederick Douglass, a civil rights leader and abolitionist. The tunnel replacement will increase capacity and speed, eliminating nearly seven hours of train delay for the average weekday. The project is part of President Biden's larger focus on implementing game-changing infrastructure projects across the country.
