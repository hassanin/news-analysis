The author, Lea Thoele, shares her unconventional path to becoming a White House intern. She initially worked as a waitress at a bakery when a stranger approached her and asked if she liked politics. After a conversation about the news, the stranger, who turned out to be the president of a major policy think tank, offered her business card and asked for her resume. Lea received an internship offer from the think tank, which she completed before later receiving an email about the Fall 2017 White House Internship Program from the same woman. Despite doubting her chances, Lea applied and was surprised to be accepted. She emphasizes the importance of seizing opportunities, even if they seem unlikely, and putting in one's best effort. Lea encourages readers to pursue opportunities, as a chance encounter with a stranger can lead to life-changing opportunities. The article also mentions that the Summer 2018 White House Internship Program application is now open.
