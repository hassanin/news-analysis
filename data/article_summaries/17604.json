The United States is taking action in response to Russia's violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The State Department is implementing visa restrictions on officials and individuals involved in threatening Ukraine's sovereignty. President Obama has also signed an Executive Order authorizing sanctions on those undermining democratic processes in Ukraine. These actions are in addition to previous measures taken, such as suspending bilateral discussions with Russia and suspending military engagement. The US is prepared to consider further steps and sanctions if necessary. However, the US also seeks a diplomatic solution and calls on Russia to engage in direct dialogue with Ukraine, withdraw military forces, and support the deployment of international observers. The US reaffirms its commitment to collective defense commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty and will provide additional support to NATO missions.
