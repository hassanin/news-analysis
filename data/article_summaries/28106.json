In this letter, President Donald Trump responds to Senator Charles Schumer, criticizing him for his handling of the COVID-19 crisis in New York. Trump accuses Schumer of focusing too much on the impeachment proceedings and not enough on helping the people of New York. He also suggests that Schumer's lack of action may lead to other politicians, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, running against him in the primary. Trump claims that he has been working with Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill DeBlasio to address the crisis, while Schumer has been absent. He concludes by stating that he never realized how ineffective Schumer is as a Senator until he became President.
