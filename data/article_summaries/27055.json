Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price hosted a listening session at the White House to hear from individuals who are facing a lack of choice in healthcare plans due to insurers pulling out of Obamacare marketplaces. Citizens from Ohio, Iowa, and Missouri shared real-life stories of how Obamacare has negatively impacted themselves, their families, their businesses, and their communities. These stories highlight the limited options of healthcare plans available and the high premiums and deductibles. Examples included a small business owner who couldn't keep employees due to the advantage given to large corporations under Obamacare, an insurance agent who had to deny insurance to friends and neighbors due to high costs, and a doctor who had to choose between his practice and his children's medical care. These examples demonstrate the tolls Obamacare has taken on the American people, and the frustration and desire for change among the American people. Secretary Price reaffirmed the Administration's commitment to reduce Obamacare's burdens and provide the highest quality healthcare system.
