Administration officials will be visiting over 35 communities across the country to survey the progress of the Recovery Act and push for additional job creation measures. The officials will be joined by governors, mayors, and members of Congress in meetings and events held in over 25 states. President Obama will mark the one-year anniversary of the Recovery Act with an event at the White House, where individuals who have benefited from the Act will be present. The Vice President is spending the day in Saginaw, MI, hearing from local residents about how the Recovery Act is helping the community. Administration officials will discuss the President's job creation proposals and how they will build on the progress of the Recovery Act. The Recovery Act, signed into law in 2009, is a combination of tax relief, financial assistance, and infrastructure projects aimed at cushioning the impact of the economic downturn and laying a foundation for recovery. The program has already created about 2 million jobs and is on track to support over 3.5 million jobs by the end of 2010.
