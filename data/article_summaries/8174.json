The Biden-Harris Administration has announced that the United States will limit its use of anti-personnel landmines. The US will align its policy on the use of these weapons outside of the Korean Peninsula with key provisions of the Ottawa Convention, an international treaty that prohibits the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of anti-personnel landmines. Additionally, the President will prohibit the development, production, and acquisition of these landmines prohibited under the Ottawa Convention. The Department of Defense will also seek alternatives to these landmines that would be compliant with the convention. The decision comes in response to the devastating impact of anti-personnel landmines in the context of Russia's war in Ukraine, where they have caused harm to civilians and civilian objects. The United States has invested over $4.2 billion in promoting international peace and security through conventional weapons destruction programs since 1993.
