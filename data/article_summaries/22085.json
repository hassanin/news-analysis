Dr. Dorothy Height, known as the godmother of the Civil Rights Movement, has passed away. She dedicated her life to fighting for equality after being denied entrance to college due to a quota on African American women. Dr. Height led the National Council of Negro Women for 40 years and was the only woman at the highest level of the Civil Rights Movement. Even in her final weeks, she continued to advocate for a more inclusive and open society. President Obama and the First Lady express their condolences to those who knew and loved Dr. Height.
