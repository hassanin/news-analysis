The article discusses a proclamation issued by President Donald J. Trump on June 22, 2020, regarding immigration in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The proclamation highlights the significant disruptions caused by the pandemic, including a sharp increase in unemployment rates. The President suspended the entry of certain immigrants for a period of 60 days to prevent further competition for scarce job opportunities. The proclamation also addressed the risks posed by nonimmigrant visa programs, such as H-1B, H-2B, J, and L visas, which could displace American workers during the economic recovery. The entry of additional workers through these programs was deemed a threat to employment opportunities for Americans affected by the economic downturn. The proclamation includes exceptions for lawful permanent residents, spouses and children of U.S. citizens, temporary workers essential to the food supply chain, and aliens whose entry is in the national interest. The article also mentions that the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Labor will provide guidance and take necessary actions to reduce the risk of introducing COVID-19 into the United States and protect U.S. workers, respectively. The proclamation is effective from June 24, 2020, until December 31, 2020, but may be continued as necessary.
