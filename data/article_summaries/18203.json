President Obama has announced the recipients of the 2013 Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the award by President John F. Kennedy. The recipients include baseball player Ernie Banks, journalist Ben Bradlee, former President Bill Clinton, and chemist Mario Molina, among others. The awards will be presented at a ceremony at the White House later this year.
