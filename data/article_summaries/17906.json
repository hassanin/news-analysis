The United States welcomes President Kiir's decision to accept and sign the peace agreement in South Sudan. However, the US does not recognize any reservations or addendums to the agreement. Implementing this agreement will require commitment and resolve from all parties involved, as well as South Sudan's regional and international partners. The US will support South Sudan in the implementation process and work with international partners to sideline those who obstruct peace. The US is grateful for the role played by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development and the African Union in securing the agreement. Together, they must help South Sudan implement the agreement, prevent famine, stand against those who block peace, and hold accountable those who have committed atrocities. The US stands in solidarity with the people of South Sudan in their efforts to build a peaceful future.
