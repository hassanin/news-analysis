Today marks the 57th anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid, two programs that have provided affordable health care coverage to millions of Americans. Approximately 140 million Americans, including seniors, pregnant women, families, and people with disabilities, benefit from these programs. However, Republicans in Congress are proposing to potentially cut Medicare and Medicaid every five years, which would leave these 140 million Americans without the peace of mind of accessible and affordable health care.

In response, Congressional Democrats, along with the speaker of the article, are fighting to strengthen these programs to ensure that no American has to choose between health care and basic necessities. They are pushing for the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which will maintain the improvements made to the Affordable Care Act under the American Rescue Plan. These improvements have saved an average of $800 per year on health insurance premiums for 13 million Americans and protected 3 million Americans from becoming uninsured.

Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act will enable Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, potentially benefiting millions of seniors and other beneficiaries. The legislation also sets a cap of $2,000 per year on out-of-pocket drug costs, resulting in significant savings for Medicare beneficiaries with chronic illnesses like cancer.

Congressional Democrats have long advocated for these changes and are now determined to pass the Inflation Reduction Act to strengthen the health and financial security of millions of Americans. The speaker urges Congress to swiftly pass this legislation to lower health care costs for millions of Americans.
