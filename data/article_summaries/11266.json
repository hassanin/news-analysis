The President has issued a notice to continue the national emergency with respect to Lebanon. This emergency was declared in 2007 due to certain individuals undermining Lebanon's sovereignty and democratic processes. The actions of these individuals contribute to political and economic instability in Lebanon and pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The President has determined that the continuing arms transfers to Hezbollah, including sophisticated weapons systems, further undermine Lebanese sovereignty and stability. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 2007 will continue for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
