President Biden has appointed Robert Fenton, the Regional Administrator for FEMA Region 9, as the White House National Monkeypox Response Coordinator. Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, the Director of the CDC Division of HIV Prevention, has been named as the White House National Monkeypox Response Deputy Coordinator. Fenton and Daskalakis will be responsible for leading the strategy and operations to combat the current monkeypox outbreak in the United States. They will focus on increasing the availability of tests, vaccinations, and treatments, with a particular emphasis on equitable distribution. Both Fenton and Daskalakis have extensive experience in federal emergency response and public health leadership, including their roles in the Biden Administration's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. They have worked on improving vaccine accessibility for underserved communities and closing the equity gap in adult vaccination rates. Fenton and Daskalakis will coordinate and manage response efforts across the White House and all federal departments and agencies, working with local, state, national, and international stakeholders. Since the first case of monkeypox was confirmed in the United States in May, the Biden-Harris Administration has implemented a comprehensive strategy to combat the virus, including vaccine distribution, testing expansion, and communication efforts. Fenton and Daskalakis will lead the administration's ongoing response and further accelerate its efforts to mitigate the spread of monkeypox, protect at-risk individuals, and provide care for those affected by the virus.
