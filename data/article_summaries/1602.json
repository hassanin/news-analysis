Australia and the United States have announced a commitment to enhance bilateral cooperation on climate, critical minerals, and clean energy. The Climate, Critical Minerals, and Clean Energy Transformation Compact will establish climate and clean energy as a central pillar of the Australia-United States Alliance. The framework aims to coordinate policies and investments to support clean energy and critical minerals supply chains, develop markets for established and emerging technologies, and meet the energy needs of the Indo-Pacific. The two countries will establish a dedicated forum on Clean Energy Industrial Transformation to set the core objectives of the Compact and will work towards identifying concrete actions within 12 months. Additionally, a ministerial-level Australia-United States Taskforce on Critical Minerals will be established to deepen collaboration on critical minerals and materials essential to clean energy and defense supply chains. The Compact also highlights the commitment to climate mitigation, adaptation, and resilience in the Indo-Pacific and beyond, with a focus on climate security, information sharing, and dialogue among defense, diplomacy, and development counterparts. The United States welcomes Australia's bid to host the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties in 2026 and both countries pledge to collaborate on initiatives to accelerate the global energy transition and enhance resilience and adaptation. The Compact does not create rights and obligations under international law but represents the political commitments of both governments.
