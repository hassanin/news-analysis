President Donald J. Trump has issued a Presidential Memorandum stating that the domestic production capability for Neodymium Iron Boron Rare Earth Sintered Material and Permanent Magnets is essential to national defense. Without Presidential action, the United States industry would not be able to provide this production capability adequately and in a timely manner. The memorandum directs the Secretary of Defense to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
