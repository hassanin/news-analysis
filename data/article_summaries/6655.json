The US government has announced that it will impose severe economic costs on governments and groups that hold Americans hostage or wrongfully detain them abroad. The Department of State and the Department of the Treasury have implemented sanctions against four individuals and two security services in Russia and Iran. These sanctions block the property and interests in property of the designated individuals and entities that are in the possession or control of US persons. The move aims to cut off these actors from the legitimate financial system. The announcement emphasizes that holding Americans hostage or wrongfully detaining them is unacceptable, and urges the immediate release of those affected.
