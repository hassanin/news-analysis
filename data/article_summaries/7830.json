The article is a speech transcript given by Vice President Kamala Harris at the Mayflower Hotel. Harris spoke about the importance of freedom and the fight for foundational principles. She expressed gratitude to organizations such as EMILYs List, Planned Parenthood, and NARAL for their endorsements and discussed the work they have done together. Harris also mentioned the historic progress made in achieving equality and freedom, but acknowledged the current national agenda that is attacking hard-won rights and freedoms. She specifically addressed the impact of the Supreme Court's decision on abortion rights and the plans of extremists in Congress to ban abortion nationwide. Harris emphasized that the people of America, along with Planned Parenthood, NARAL, and EMILYs List, will not accept such a ban. She highlighted the importance of reproductive rights and legislation that restores the protections of Roe v. Wade, noting that the majority of Americans agree with this stance. Harris also discussed the importance of empathy and lifting others up as qualities of a true leader. She concluded by introducing Dr. Serena Floyd, the Medical Director for Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, D.C., who is on the frontlines of the fight for reproductive rights.
