Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change, Carol Browner, met with BP executives Bob Dudley, Lamar McKay, David Nagel, and Karen St. John to discuss containment, redundancy, claims, and scientific monitoring. The meeting with Dudley was important as he has a new role in Gulf restoration. Browner emphasized the President's commitment to the Gulf region and stated that they will not be satisfied until the leak is stopped, the oil is contained and cleaned up, and the people of the Gulf can resume their lives and livelihoods. She also made it clear that BP's work and response will be judged based on these goals, with no exceptions.
