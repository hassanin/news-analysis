The Acting OMB Director, Russ Vought, held a press briefing to release President Trump's Fiscal Year 2021 Budget. The budget aims to balance the budget within 15 years by proposing $4.6 trillion in deficit reduction. It includes $741 billion for defense, investments in border security and immigration enforcement, funding for NASA's return to the Moon and Mars, and a $1 trillion infrastructure package. The budget proposes reforms to lower drug prices, address wasteful spending, and implement work requirements for Medicaid and other welfare programs. It also includes cuts to foreign aid and the EPA. The budget assumes a 2.8% economic growth rate and does not factor in the impact of the coronavirus or changes in monetary policy. The budget has faced criticism from Democrats who argue that it cuts Medicare, Medicaid, and other welfare programs. The budget also includes $2 trillion in mandatory savings and reform proposals. The President was actively involved in the budget process and is particularly excited about nuclear modernization and the Yucca Mountain policy. It is uncertain whether the budget will pass in Congress.
