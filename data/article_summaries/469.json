The article discusses the importance of passing the Equality Act in the United States. It highlights the fact that millions of Americans, particularly LGBTQ+ individuals, lack basic non-discrimination protections in many states. The absence of federal non-discrimination laws allows for discrimination in areas such as housing, education, and credit based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The Equality Act aims to provide long overdue civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ Americans by amending the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to explicitly include sexual orientation and gender identity. The bill also addresses the discrimination faced by transgender individuals, especially transgender women of color, in areas such as housing, employment, and healthcare. Additionally, it recognizes the mental health inequities and increased risk of suicide among LGBTQ+ youth due to discrimination and bullying. The Equality Act not only focuses on LGBTQ+ rights but also aims to expand protections for people of color, women, people with disabilities, and people of faith in public accommodations.
