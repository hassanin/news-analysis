Today, Vice President Kamala Harris convened state legislators and advocates in Boston, Massachusetts to discuss the fight to protect reproductive rights and freedoms. Governor Charlie Baker (R-MA) was also present. The participants highlighted the steps taken by Governor Baker and Massachusetts state legislators to protect reproductive health care and emphasized the urgency for other states to take action following the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade. The Vice President commended the leaders for their bipartisan efforts in defending reproductive health care, including expanding access and protecting patients and providers. She praised Massachusetts as a national model for protecting reproductive rights on the state level and urged the leaders to support state legislators across the country who are fighting for abortion protections. The Vice President emphasized that reproductive rights are not a partisan issue, stating that a majority of Americans believe women should have the right to make decisions about their bodies and lives without government interference. The state leaders expressed gratitude to the Vice President for the Administration's leadership on reproductive care and expressed their willingness to work together to advocate for women's health. This event in Massachusetts marks the seventh state that the Vice President has visited to convene state legislators on the issue of protecting reproductive health care. She has also convened legislators from Montana, Indiana, Florida, South Dakota, and Nebraska in Washington D.C., and has engaged with various stakeholders, including healthcare providers, constitutional law experts, faith leaders, state attorneys general, disability rights leaders, and advocates, over the past three months.
