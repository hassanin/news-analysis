The Georgia Supreme Court has upheld an abortion ban that has severely limited the reproductive freedom of women in Georgia and threatened doctors with imprisonment for providing care. This decision, along with similar bans, has had a dangerous impact on women across the country. Women have been denied necessary medical care, forced to travel long distances for treatment, and faced complications that affect their ability to have children in the future. Republican officials are now pushing for a national abortion ban, which would criminalize reproductive health care in every state. President Biden and Vice President Harris are committed to restoring the protections of Roe v. Wade through federal law.
