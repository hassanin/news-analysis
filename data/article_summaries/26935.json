The Vice President, Mike Pence, has commended the Supreme Court for upholding a part of the Indiana law that requires the remains of aborted babies to be treated with respect and dignity. This ruling also prevents organizations from selling fetal remains. Pence expressed hope that the Supreme Court will review other state laws that ban abortion based on sex, race, or disability. He believes that legal protections against discrimination should be extended to unborn Americans. Pence's Press Secretary, Alyssa Farah, stated that many countries prohibit selective abortion and the United States should do the same.
