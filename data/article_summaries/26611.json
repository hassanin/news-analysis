Melania Trump, the first lady of the United States, and Jim Carroll, the primary drug adviser to the president, have reaffirmed their commitment to ensuring that the American people and youth can live in strong, safe, and healthy communities that are drug-free. In partnership with the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and the first lady's Be Best campaign, they aim to prevent youth substance use and raise awareness about the consequences of illicit drug use. Their approach focuses on primary prevention, which involves educating individuals about the risks of drug use and stopping drugs from entering communities.
