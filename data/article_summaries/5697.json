Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at the South Court Auditorium, emphasizing the importance of the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit for working families. She shared a letter from a mother in Pennsylvania who expressed the need for a little help to make ends meet. Harris stated that these tax credits are already making a difference and are on track to cut child poverty in America by 40 percent. She urged eligible individuals to check if they qualify for these credits on the ChildTaxCredit.gov website and reminded those who have already received the Child Tax Credit to still file their taxes to receive the second half of what they are owed. Harris called for a collaborative effort to spread the word about these credits, involving state and local governments, faith-based organizations, community groups, and individuals. She concluded by reiterating the impact of these measures on working families and the nation as a whole.
