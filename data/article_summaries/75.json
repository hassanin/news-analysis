President Joe Biden has proclaimed October 8-14, 2023, as National School Lunch Week. The proclamation highlights the importance of providing healthy meals to children and recognizes the work of school nutrition professionals in feeding 30 million students each school day. School lunches have been crucial for many students, providing a balanced meal and contributing to better academic performance and reduced childhood obesity. The administration has prioritized the well-being of American families and children, expanding the Child Tax Credit, modernizing the Thrifty Food Plan, and convening the first White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health in over 50 years. The national strategy aims to end hunger and reduce diet-related diseases by 2030, including the goal of expanding access to healthy, free school meals for 9 million more children. Progress has already been made, with programs providing families money to buy groceries during the summer and schools offering healthy meals to all students at no cost. Efforts are also being made to support schools in cooking meals from scratch and purchasing food from local farmers and ranchers. The President calls on Congress to restore the enhanced Child Tax Credit to help families afford healthy food at home. The proclamation emphasizes that no child should go to bed hungry and that access to nutritious meals at school is essential for children to thrive. It acknowledges and honors the farmers, ranchers, teachers, school nutrition professionals, and staff who make these lunches possible.
