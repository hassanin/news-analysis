The article discusses the participation of over 500 chefs in First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move! campaign to combat childhood obesity. These chefs have joined the Chefs Move to Schools program, which aims to educate children about food and nutrition. The article emphasizes the importance of good nutrition in schools, as children consume a significant portion of their daily calories there. The Let's Move! campaign aims to involve all sectors in improving children's health and provides tools for schools, families, and communities to promote physical activity and healthy eating. As part of the campaign, the Obama Administration plans to reauthorize the Child Nutrition Act, increase the number of schools participating in the Healthier US School Challenge, and improve the nutritional quality of school meals. Major school food suppliers have committed to meeting recommendations for healthier meals, and the School Nutrition Association plans to increase education and awareness about obesity. Additionally, various school leadership organizations have set goals to meet the Let's Move! initiative and Healthier US School Challenge standards. The efforts of these organizations will impact 50 million students and their families nationwide.
