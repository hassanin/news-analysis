President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring July 28, 2011, as World Hepatitis Day in the United States. The proclamation raises awareness about viral hepatitis, a disease that affects millions of Americans and can lead to lifelong health issues. It highlights the importance of preventing new infections, ensuring treatment reaches those in need, and eliminating the transmission of hepatitis B from mothers to their children. The proclamation also emphasizes the need to reduce the stigma surrounding hepatitis and make testing, information, counseling, and treatment available to all. The Affordable Care Act covers services such as hepatitis immunizations and screenings, and the administration has released a comprehensive Action Plan for the Prevention, Care, and Treatment of Viral Hepatitis. The proclamation encourages citizens, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and communities to participate in activities that increase awareness about hepatitis and its prevention.
