This article is a message from President Barack Obama to the Congress regarding the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The President intends to declare a list of sites, locations, facilities, and activities in the United States to the IAEA, as required by the U.S.-IAEA Additional Protocol. The President certifies that each site, location, facility, and activity has been examined by relevant departments and agencies, and appropriate measures have been taken to protect national security information during IAEA inspections. The enclosed draft declaration provides a detailed description of the sites, locations, facilities, and activities, and the provisions of the U.S.-IAEA Additional Protocol under which they would be declared. The IAEA classification of the declaration is "Highly Confidential Safeguards Sensitive," but the United States regards it as "Sensitive but Unclassified." Information reported or acquired by the United States Government under this title or the U.S.-IAEA Additional Protocol is exempt from disclosure under United States Code.
