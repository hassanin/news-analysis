President Donald J. Trump has released his legislative goals to rebuild the United States' crumbling infrastructure. The plan includes six principles: stimulating infrastructure investment, investing in rural America, increasing state and local authority, eliminating regulatory barriers, streamlining permitting, and investing in the country's most important asset - its people. The goal is to rebuild failing infrastructure, develop innovative projects, and create good-paying jobs for Americans. The plan aims to generate at least $1.5 trillion in investments for infrastructure development.
