As the Holy Month of Ramadan approaches, the United States is engaging in proactive diplomacy with its friends and partners in the Middle East region. The goal is to create a more secure and integrated region by using a combination of deterrence against adversaries and diplomacy to reduce tensions and de-escalate conflicts. This approach was exemplified by Secretary of State Blinken's attendance at a historic meeting in Israel, where a group of countries agreed to form permanent working groups to improve security and livelihoods in the region. The UAE and Israel also concluded a Free Trade Agreement, showcasing the new opportunities emerging in the region. Secretary Blinken reaffirmed President Biden's commitment to ensuring equal measures of freedom, dignity, security, and prosperity for Israelis and Palestinians during his visit to Ramallah. Additionally, King Abdullah II of Jordan hosted the first-ever visit by an Israeli head of state, President Isaac Herzog, and played a crucial role as custodian over the Holy Sites in Jerusalem. The United States stands with its friends facing terrorist threats, offering assistance to Israel in the wake of recent attacks. Ending the war in Yemen has been a consistent focus, and a 60-day truce has been announced, ceasing military operations and easing restrictions on the flow of goods and people into and out of Yemen. President Biden commended Saudi Arabia and Oman for their leadership in finalizing this initiative, hoping it will establish a foundation for political talks and a lasting settlement. While working towards peace, the United States remains committed to supporting the defense of its partners, including the UAE and Saudi Arabia, and has imposed new sanctions on Iran's missile procurement network. Overall, diplomacy is creating opportunities for a more peaceful and prosperous region, while efforts to deter and counter threats continue.
