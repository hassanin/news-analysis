The Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence, delivered a speech at the 49th Annual Washington Conference on the Americas. He discussed the theme of the conference, which is "disruption and transformation" in the Americas. Pence highlighted the profound transformation that has taken place in Latin America over the last two years, with the Trump administration working to build a safer and more prosperous Western Hemisphere. He mentioned the efforts to provide development financing, expand access to affordable energy, and promote free trade. Pence also emphasized the importance of strengthening security ties and fighting against illegal drugs. 

However, Pence identified the regime of Nicol√°s Maduro in Venezuela as the single greatest disrupter of peace and prosperity in the region. He condemned the actions of the Maduro regime, such as the arrest of journalists and the violent suppression of protests. Pence emphasized that the struggle in Venezuela is between dictatorship and democracy, and called for Maduro to step down. He highlighted the suffering of the Venezuelan people, including economic collapse, food shortages, and high crime rates. Pence also criticized the support that Maduro receives from countries like Iran, Russia, and Cuba. He announced that the United States Navy will deploy the USNS Comfort to provide medical assistance to the region and expressed the United States' commitment to helping the Venezuelan people. Pence called on other nations to stand with Venezuela in its fight for freedom and democracy.
