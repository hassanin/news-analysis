The President signed into law several bills designating various facilities of the United States Postal Service and the Department of Veterans Affairs. These bills include designating post offices in South Carolina, New York, Guam, and California, as well as an outpatient clinic in California. The bills also include the "Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act," which allows borrowers to separate previously jointly consolidated student loans. The President thanked the representatives, senators, and others for their leadership in these efforts.
