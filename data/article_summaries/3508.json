President Joe Biden spoke at Irvine Valley College in Irvine, California, discussing the progress being made to bring down healthcare costs. He highlighted the issue of high prescription drug prices and the impact it has on families. Biden mentioned the Inflation Reduction Act, which gives Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices and caps out-of-pocket costs for seniors. He also addressed the issue of insulin prices and announced an executive order to find additional ways to lower prescription drug costs for seniors. Biden criticized Republicans for opposing the Inflation Reduction Act and warned that if they regain control, healthcare prices will go up and programs like Medicare and Social Security will be cut. He emphasized the importance of sticking together as a nation and expressed optimism about America's future.
