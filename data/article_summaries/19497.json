The article discusses a message from the President of the United States to the Congress regarding Iceland's whaling activities. The Secretary of the Interior has certified that Iceland's trade in whale meat and products diminishes the effectiveness of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This is the third certification of Iceland for their whaling activities. Iceland's commercial harvest of fin whales, mainly exported to Japan, has increased in recent years and exceeds sustainable catch levels advised by the International Whaling Commission (IWC). These actions jeopardize the survival of the fin whale, which is listed as a threatened species. The President has directed relevant U.S. agencies to raise concerns with Iceland in international forums, meet with Icelandic officials to urge a halt to commercial whaling, and encourage nonlethal uses of whales in Iceland. The President has also directed departments and agencies to report on their actions within six months. Trade measures on Icelandic products are not being imposed at this time, but the situation will continue to be monitored. The President believes that continued focus on Icelandic whaling activities is necessary to encourage Iceland to halt commercial whaling and support international conservation efforts.
