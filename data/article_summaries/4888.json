The White House has announced the creation of the Worker Organizing and Empowerment Task Force, with Vice President Kamala Harris as the chair and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh as the vice chair. The task force aims to protect workers' rights and promote unionization, as well as address income inequality. The decline in union membership over the years has contributed to wage stagnation and increased inequality. The task force will work to increase union density and empower workers across all federal agencies. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of protecting workers' rights and has accelerated the need for action. Secretary Walsh emphasized the economic benefits of organized labor and the need to restore fairness in the organizing process. The task force will collaborate with various federal agencies to support workers' rights and collective bargaining.
