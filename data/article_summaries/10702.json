President Obama signed an Executive Order creating the White House Council on Women and Girls. The council's mission is to provide a coordinated federal response to the challenges faced by women and girls, ensuring that all Cabinet and Cabinet-level agencies consider how their policies and programs impact women and families. The council will be chaired by Valerie Jarrett, Assistant to the President and Senior Advisor, and will include cabinet-level federal agencies. The Executive Director of the Council will be Tina Tchen, Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of Public Liaison at the White House. The council will work to enhance, support, and coordinate existing programs for women and girls, while also serving as a resource for agencies and the White House. Its priorities include improving women's economic security, establishing a balance between work and family, preventing violence against women, and improving women's healthcare. The council will meet regularly and includes members from various government departments, agencies, and offices. The President may also designate additional heads of other Executive Branch departments, agencies, and offices to join the council.
