President Biden will visit a family farm to announce actions his administration is taking to support American farmers, reduce food prices, and address global food shortages caused by pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and Putin's price hike. Putin's invasion of Ukraine has cut off a critical source of wheat, corn, barley, oilseeds, and cooking oil, leading to disruptions in global supply chains for fertilizer. These actions, combined with pandemic-related disruptions, have caused global food prices to increase nearly 13 percent. American farmers have been crucial in the fight against Putin's price hike, with agricultural exports reaching a record-breaking $177 billion in President Biden's first year in office. The President has previously mobilized American farmers by allowing the sale of E15 gasoline, and he will now announce new actions to provide farmers with the necessary tools and resources to boost production, lower food prices, and support rural communities. These actions aim to grow new markets for American-grown food and create jobs.
