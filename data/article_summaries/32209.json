President Donald Trump has signed the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act into law. However, the President has raised concerns about two provisions in the Act. The first provision establishes the Adams Memorial Commission, which is responsible for planning and establishing a permanent memorial in Washington, D.C., to honor President John Adams. The Commission includes members of Congress, but the President believes that they should not participate in matters involving the execution of laws, in order to maintain separation of powers. The second provision amends the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and directs the Secretary of the Interior to adopt the recommendation of a regional migratory bird Flyway Council in establishing hunting seasons for certain migratory birds. The President is concerned about the appointment and removal process of the Flyway Councils, as they are not composed of officers of the United States. Despite these concerns, the President will not treat the provision as limiting his discretion to reject the recommendation of a Flyway Council when establishing hunting seasons.
