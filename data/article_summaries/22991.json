Vice President Biden has been tasked with leading a new national mission to cure cancer, which he refers to as a "moonshot." He believes that research and therapies are on the verge of incredible breakthroughs, and he aims to accelerate progress towards finding a cure. The initiative will focus on areas such as cancer immunotherapy, genomics, and combination therapies, and will also work towards improving access to treatments for patients. The Vice President plans to increase resources for cancer research and break down silos to bring together all stakeholders in the fight against cancer. The goal is to double the rate of progress and make a decade's worth of advances in just five years. The Vice President will lead a combined effort by governments, private industry, researchers, physicians, patients, and philanthropies to target investment and increase access to information in the cancer community. The Federal government will provide support through funding, incentives, and coordination. The initiative also aims to improve communication among doctors, revolutionize data sharing, and give patients access to their own data. Vice President Biden will be meeting with experts to discuss cancer research and treatment, and will convene meetings with relevant agencies to improve federal investment in cancer research. The Vice President believes that this mission can inspire a global commitment to end cancer and inspire a new generation of scientists.
