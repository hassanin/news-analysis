On National Atomic Veterans Day, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. recognizes the brave service of America's Atomic Veterans. These veterans participated in nuclear testing between 1945 and 1962, served in the Armed Forces in or around Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or were held as prisoners of war in or near Hiroshima or Nagasaki. Despite their service, Atomic Veterans were not allowed to discuss the nature of their service, including with their families. Many developed serious health conditions due to radiation exposure but were unable to seek medical care or disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Decades later, the Nuclear Radiation and Secrecy Agreements Act was repealed, allowing these veterans to qualify for select VA benefits and services. However, many Atomic Veterans passed away without receiving the healthcare they deserved. President Biden is committed to ensuring that all veterans and their families have timely access to services, medical care, and benefits. On National Atomic Veterans Day, Americans are called upon to honor the Atomic Veterans and their sacrifices.
