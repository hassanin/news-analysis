The Biden-Harris Administration is taking significant steps to advance clean energy and create jobs in the United States. They have focused on offshore wind, solar, transmission lines, and other clean energy projects. Seven federal agencies are announcing various initiatives and plans to demonstrate the administration's commitment to cleaner and cheaper energy. These actions include conducting reviews of wind energy areas off the coasts of California, exploring potential wind energy areas in the Gulf of Mexico and other locations, and advancing lease sales in specific regions.

The administration is also fast-tracking clean energy projects on public lands, such as solar, wind, and geothermal energy projects. They are working closely with community stakeholders to ensure environmentally sound practices. Additionally, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes funding to build thousands of miles of new transmission lines, critical for unlocking clean energy resources and providing affordable and reliable electricity.

To support these efforts, the Department of Energy is launching a coordinated transmission deployment program, aimed at nationwide buildout of long-distance, high-voltage transmission lines. The program focuses on regulatory reform, improved permitting processes, and increased collaboration between federal agencies and stakeholders.

The administration is also prioritizing clean energy deployment in rural communities, providing financing for agricultural producers, rural small businesses, and grid upgrades. The Department of Agriculture is creating a new Rural Energy Pilot Program to support underserved rural communities in deploying community-scale clean energy technologies. This program will also assist economically distressed rural communities in developing clean, affordable, and reliable power.

Furthermore, the American Rescue Plan is driving economic recovery and supporting clean energy industries. The Economic Development Administration has announced finalists for the Build Back Better Regional Challenge, which supports regional industry clusters promoting equitable economic growth and workforce development. These finalists include projects focused on clean energy generation, offshore wind for hydrogen production, and clean energy job training and innovation.

The administration is also helping local governments streamline approvals for rooftop solar installations through the Solar Automated Permit Processing (SolarAPP+) tool. This online platform has reduced permit review times to less than one day in pilot locations and is being expanded to other communities across the country.

Overall, the Biden-Harris Administration is taking comprehensive actions to advance clean energy, create jobs, and combat climate change. These efforts are part of their commitment to transitioning the United States to a clean energy future.
