The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) has analyzed the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) estimate of the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) and focused on its effect on Medicaid. The CEA's analysis provides important information about the BCRA's impact on federal Medicaid spending. Contrary to media reports of significant Medicaid "cuts," the BCRA actually results in at least $265 billion more federal Medicaid spending between 2018 and 2026, compared to 2017 levels. This spending could potentially be as high as $554 billion if the CBO's assumption that people will drop Medicaid coverage due to the repeal of the individual mandate is incorrect. The reported "cuts" are primarily reductions in the rate of federal Medicaid spending growth, based on the CBO's assumption that more than half of non-expansion states will adopt the Medicaid expansion by 2026. Overall, the BCRA aims to put Medicaid on a sustainable trajectory.
