In this presidential memorandum, President Barack Obama determines that there is an unforeseen emergency that requires immediate military assistance to Chad and France in their efforts to secure Mali from terrorists and violent extremists. He further determines that these requirements cannot be met under the authority of the Arms Export Control Act or any other provision of law. Therefore, he directs the drawdown of up to $50 million in defense services from the Department of Defense for these purposes, under the authorities of section 506(a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The Secretary of State is authorized and directed to report this determination to Congress, arrange for its publication in the Federal Register, and coordinate the implementation of this drawdown.
