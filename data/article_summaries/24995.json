The White House has announced the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Burma. Despite progress made by the Burmese government in areas such as the release of political prisoners and improving labor standards, concerns remain regarding the ongoing conflict and human rights abuses in the country. The Burmese military operates with little oversight and often acts with impunity. The United States remains committed to supporting Burma's reform efforts and working towards a sustained and irreversible democratic transition.
