President Obama commends the bipartisan effort in passing a responsible and long-term budget agreement that supports the values of the American people, promotes economic growth, and creates jobs. The agreement focuses on strengthening the middle class through investments in education, job training, and research, as well as prioritizing national security. It also avoids harmful cuts to Medicare and Social Security, ensuring the protection of seniors. The funding for this agreement is balanced and responsible, including measures to ensure that hedge funds pay their fair share of taxes. The two-year funding will help prevent future government shutdowns and crises that harm the economy. President Obama emphasizes that this agreement demonstrates that Washington has the ability to assist in America's progress rather than hinder it. He looks forward to signing it into law and urges Congress to continue working on spending bills that prioritize America's needs without being distracted by ideological provisions. This approach will help support workers, businesses, and the overall growth of the economy, creating opportunities for all Americans.
