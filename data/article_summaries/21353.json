The White House is expressing deep concern over the recent conviction of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev in Russia. They are troubled by the alleged due process violations and abuse of the legal system. The statement highlights that selectively applying the law to these individuals undermines Russia's reputation as a country committed to the rule of law. The Obama administration stands with those in Russia who are dedicated to strengthening the rule of law and universal values. Failure to uphold these values hinders Russia's modernization and its relationship with the United States. President Obama has discussed this case with President Medvedev, emphasizing the importance of strengthening the rule of law. The White House will closely monitor the next stages of this case, including the fairness of the sentences and the appeals process.
