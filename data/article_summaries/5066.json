President Joe Biden has declared a major disaster in Mississippi and ordered federal assistance to aid in the recovery efforts following Hurricane Ida. The declaration makes federal funding available to individuals, businesses, and governments in several affected counties. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other recovery programs. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has appointed Brett H. Howard as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. Further designations and assistance may be provided based on damage assessments.
