In his State of the Union address, the President emphasized the need for strong oversight and criminal enforcement of pandemic fraud. He announced the appointment of a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud within the Department of Justice. The previous administration was criticized for undermining the watchdogs responsible for preventing the wastage and abuse of relief funds. Scammers took advantage of emergency loans intended for small businesses, and criminal syndicates intercepted benefits meant for Americans in need. Identity theft cases surged by 3,000% from 2019 to 2020. The COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force has already initiated over 1,000 criminal cases to recover billions of dollars. The administration is working with the oversight community to implement fraud prevention tools for areas like small business loans and unemployment insurance. With the appointment of a Chief Pandemic Prosecutor, the Department of Justice aims to intensify efforts to crack down on fraudulent individuals and recover stolen relief funds for the American people.
