The Maritime Transportation System (MTS), which contributes to a quarter of the US GDP, is identified as a top priority for national defense, homeland security, and economic competitiveness. The plan aims to strengthen maritime commerce efficiency and reliability by addressing cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities over the next five years.
