This article is a memorandum from President Barack Obama to the heads of executive departments and agencies. The memorandum addresses the issue of lobbyists serving in privileged positions within the executive branch and the undue influence of special interests. President Obama mentions that his administration is committed to reducing this influence and changing the culture of special interest access. He refers to Executive Order 13490, which places limits on lobbyists serving in government positions related to their prior lobbying activities. He also mentions the aspiration of keeping federal agencies' advisory boards free of federally registered lobbyists. President Obama directs the heads of executive departments and agencies not to make any new appointments or reappointments of federally registered lobbyists to advisory committees and other boards and commissions. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is instructed to issue proposed guidance within 90 days to implement this policy, with the final guidance to be issued after public comment. The memorandum concludes by stating that it does not create any right or benefit enforceable by any party against the United States or its entities.
