The article discusses a Presidential Memorandum issued by former President Donald Trump regarding Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) for certain Venezuelans. The memorandum states that the autocratic government of Nicolas Maduro has violated the freedoms of the Venezuelan people, leading to a humanitarian crisis and mass migration. The Trump administration has imposed sanctions on Maduro and recognized Juan Guaid√≥ as the interim president of Venezuela. Due to the deteriorating conditions in Venezuela, which pose a national security threat to the US, the memorandum directs the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to defer the removal of Venezuelan nationals in the US for 18 months, with certain exceptions. It also authorizes employment for those whose removal has been deferred.
