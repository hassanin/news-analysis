In this article, Secretary Ben Carson discusses the need for a welfare system of opportunity in America. Despite low unemployment rates, there is still a high number of people enrolled in welfare programs. Carson argues that too many Americans are stuck in a cycle of poverty and that the welfare system should promote work, free enterprise, and stable families. He emphasizes the importance of measuring outcomes and not just participation in welfare programs. The executive order signed by President Trump is seen as a positive step towards a more dynamic and innovative welfare system.
