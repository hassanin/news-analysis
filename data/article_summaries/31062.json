President Trump announced in a speech on May 8, 2018 that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). He stated that the deal was a "horrible, one-sided deal" that allowed Iran to continue enriching uranium and supported its other malign activities. Trump argued that the deal did not address Iran's development of ballistic missiles, its support for terrorism, or its destabilizing activities in the Middle East. He also mentioned that Iran had recently been revealed to have pursued nuclear weapons in the past, contradicting its claims of a peaceful nuclear program. Trump stated that the United States will reinstate nuclear sanctions on Iran and impose the highest level of economic sanctions. He emphasized that the United States will not be held hostage to nuclear blackmail and will not allow Iran to gain access to nuclear weapons. Trump also mentioned that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on his way to North Korea for preparations for a meeting with Kim Jong-un, expressing hope for a successful deal. He concluded by sending a message to the people of Iran, stating that the future of Iran belongs to its people and expressing readiness to negotiate a new deal that benefits Iran and its people.
