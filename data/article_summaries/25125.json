President Trump has signed four executive orders aimed at reducing prescription drug prices and increasing access to life-saving medications. These orders are expected to restructure the prescription drug market and make medications more affordable and accessible for all Americans. The signing of these orders builds on the progress made in 2018, where prescription drug prices saw their largest annual decrease in over 50 years. Average basic premiums for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans have also fallen by 13.5% since 2017, saving beneficiaries $1.9 billion in premium costs. The President's actions have been praised by Americans who have shared personal stories about the burden of high medical costs and the importance of affordable medication.
