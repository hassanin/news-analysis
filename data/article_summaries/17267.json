The White House Office of the First Lady, along with Epicurious, the Department of Education, and the Department of Agriculture, announced the winners of the Healthy Lunchtime Challenge. This nationwide recipe challenge promotes healthy lunches as part of the First Lady's Let's Move! initiative. The winners, representing all U.S. states, three territories, and the District of Columbia, will attend a Kids' "State Dinner" at the White House on July 18. The event will feature a healthy lunch with a selection of the winning recipes, followed by a visit to the White House Kitchen Garden. The challenge invited parents or guardians to work with their children ages 8-12 to create a lunchtime recipe that is healthy, affordable, original, and delicious. The recipes had to adhere to the guidance of USDA's MyPlate to ensure they met the criteria of a healthy meal. Over 1,500 entries were received, featuring wholesome ingredients such as salmon, black beans, and ground turkey. The winners were chosen by a panel of judges, and the full list of winners and recipes can be found online. A free downloadable and printable e-cookbook of the winning recipes will also be available in July. First Lady Michelle Obama expressed her excitement about hosting the winners and showcasing their healthy creations.
