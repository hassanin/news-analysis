President Donald Trump has signed into law the "North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act of 2017" in an effort to promote human rights and freedom in North Korea. However, the legislation contains provisions that could be interpreted as requiring the President to adopt a specific foreign policy or engage in negotiations with foreign governments and international organizations. As a result, President Trump is directing his administration to implement these provisions in a manner that aligns with his constitutional authority to conduct foreign affairs.
