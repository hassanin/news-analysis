The Ninth Circuit has blocked a federal judge's order protecting pregnant women in need of emergency medical care from Idaho's abortion ban. This decision puts women's health at risk and threatens doctors with prosecution for providing emergency care. The Biden-Harris Administration is deeply concerned and believes that too many women are suffering the consequences of delayed care, jeopardizing their health and lives. The President and Vice President are committed to fighting for reproductive rights and urge Congress to pass a bill that restores the protections of Roe v. Wade into federal law.
