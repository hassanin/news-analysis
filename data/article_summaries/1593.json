The historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law aims to rebuild crumbling roads and bridges, replace lead pipes, provide high-speed internet to every family in America, and support American manufacturing jobs. The law will allocate nearly $100 billion in funding to states, territories, tribes, and local governments, with an additional $50 billion in funding opportunities. Over 4,000 projects have been announced, including airport improvements, port upgrades, and superfund cleanup sites. The Biden-Harris administration will partner with non-federal entities to deliver these infrastructure projects and create jobs. President Biden will highlight the impact of these investments in his State of the Union Address, pledging to start repairs on 65,000 miles of roads and 1,500 bridges. The law also addresses transportation, high-speed internet, and climate and clean energy initiatives.
