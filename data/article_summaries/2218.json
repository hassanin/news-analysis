In this article, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. reports on a series of attacks perpetrated by militia groups affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) against United States personnel and facilities in Iraq and Syria. On March 23, 2023, an unmanned aerial system attack resulted in the death of an American contractor and the injury of six others, including five US service members. In response to these attacks and ongoing threats, the United States conducted targeted strikes on facilities in eastern Syria that were used by groups affiliated with the IRGC.

President Biden directed these strikes in accordance with his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive, as well as to protect US citizens and advance national security and foreign policy interests. The military action was conducted in compliance with international law and the United States' inherent right of self-defense. The President is prepared to take further action if necessary to address future threats or attacks. The report is provided to Congress in accordance with the War Powers Resolution.
