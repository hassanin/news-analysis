On May 21, 2009, President Obama welcomed the Super Bowl Champion Pittsburgh Steelers to the White House for a service event with the USO. Approximately 50 Wounded Warriors from Walter Reed Army Medical Center and National Naval Medical Center, along with their families, were also in attendance. The President delivered brief remarks before the Steelers players, service members, and their families worked with the USO to assemble care packages for troops. The Operation USO Care Package program, which started in 2003, has assembled over 1.6 million care packages. The USO sends around 25,000 packages a month to deployed service members. At this particular event, all guests were expected to pack 3,000 care packages to be sent to troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. The stage participants included Art Rooney II, Coach Mike Tomlin, Super Bowl MVP Santonio Holmes, and team captains Ben Roethlisberger, Hines Ward, James Farrior, and Jeff Reed. Expected attendees also included the Pittsburgh Steelers and their staff, Secretary Vilsack, Secretary Shinseki, Senator Bob Casey, Senator Arlen Specter, members of the House of Representatives, Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl, and PA County Executive Dan Onorato.
