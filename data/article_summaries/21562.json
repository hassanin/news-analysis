The article states that President Barack Obama has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the former Liberian regime of Charles Taylor will continue beyond July 22, 2013. Despite Liberia's progress in promoting democracy and the recent conviction of Charles Taylor for war crimes, the actions and policies of Taylor and others, particularly their unlawful depletion of Liberian resources and removal of funds and property, still pose a threat to the United States' foreign policy. Therefore, Obama has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
