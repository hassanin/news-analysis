Jill and the person speaking send their warm greetings to those celebrating Eid al-Adha. They mention that the traditions and rituals associated with Eid and Hajj hold special significance this year due to the challenges posed by COVID-19. They highlight that the American people are proud to contribute to the global fight against COVID-19 by donating over half a billion vaccines to countries, including Muslim-majority nations. They emphasize the need for collective efforts to save lives and end the pandemic. They also mention that the Hajj serves as a reminder of Islam's commitment to equality and the shared roots of the world's Abrahamic faiths. The United States is committed to working with the international community to recover from the pandemic, and many Muslim Americans are eager to perform the pilgrimage next year. They conclude by wishing everyone celebrating a safe and wonderful holiday.
