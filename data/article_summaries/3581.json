The article discusses the importance of affordable and quality health coverage for all Americans. It highlights the success of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in providing millions of Americans with coverage and the recent Special Enrollment Period opened by the Biden administration. During this period, 2.8 million more Americans gained access to reliable health coverage through HealthCare.gov and state-based marketplaces. The article also mentions the expanded premium subsidies included in the American Rescue Plan, which have lowered the cost of health care for many families. Premiums have decreased by an average of $67 per month, and over four in ten Americans found a quality plan for $10 or less per month. Additionally, out-of-pocket spending has decreased, with the median deductible for new enrollees dropping by over 90%. However, the article emphasizes that there is still work to be done to further reduce health care costs. The Build Back Better Agenda proposed by President Biden aims to lower prescription drug costs, provide health care premium tax cuts, and extend coverage to millions more Americans. The article concludes by urging Congress to act quickly to expand access and lower health care costs.
