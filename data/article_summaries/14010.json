On October 15, 2010, President Obama signed two bills into law. The first bill, S. 1510, called the "United States Secret Service Uniformed Division Modernization Act of 2010," transfers the provisions for pay and work hours for members of the U.S. Secret Service Uniformed Division from the District of Columbia Code to the United States Code. It also authorizes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to determine and adjust basic pay rates for members of the Uniformed Division, and allows the Secret Service to hire individuals with exceptional qualifications at a higher rate of pay. 

The second bill, S. 3196, known as the "Pre-Election Presidential Transition Act of 2010," authorizes the General Services Administration to provide certain services and facilities to the main contenders for President and Vice President of the United States before a general election. These services and facilities are meant to assist the contenders in their preparations for assuming official duties.
