The White House has announced a series of initiatives to combat patent trolls and strengthen the patent system to foster innovation. These initiatives include promoting transparency in patent ownership, making patents clear and understandable, protecting small businesses from abusive litigation, expanding outreach and focused study, strengthening enforcement of exclusion orders, and promoting innovation for global development. The White House is also introducing three new executive actions to encourage innovation and improve the quality and accessibility of the patent system. These actions include crowdsourcing prior art, providing more robust technical training for patent examiners, and offering pro bono assistance to inventors who lack legal representation. The White House is calling on Congress to pass patent reform legislation to further combat patent trolls.
