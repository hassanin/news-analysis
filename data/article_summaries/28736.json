The Trump Administration has finalized a price transparency reform in American healthcare, which requires health insurance companies to disclose the prices they pay for covered services and prescription drugs to the public. Additionally, insurance companies are now required to disclose the estimated cost that patients will have to pay before receiving care. This action fulfills President Trump's commitment to bring transparency to healthcare costs and give patients better visibility into their care expenses.
