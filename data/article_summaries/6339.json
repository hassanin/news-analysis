Last week, senior White House officials held a meeting with leaders from legacy Black civil rights organizations. The officials emphasized the Biden-Harris administration's commitment to justice and equity for the Black community and all Americans, especially in the face of recent attacks on progress. They discussed strategies to combat hate-fueled violence, promote inclusion, and protect voting rights through legislation. The officials also provided an update on the equitable implementation of President Biden's Investing in America agenda. The civil rights leaders shared their recommendations on advancing racial equity, updating their efforts to protect voting rights, and addressing the risks of artificial intelligence. They also discussed strengthening diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in both the public and private sectors. The meeting included representatives from the civil rights organizations and White House officials.
