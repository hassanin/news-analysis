President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Wisconsin, providing federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts following a severe winter storm and snowstorm that occurred from January 31 to February 3, 2011. The declaration allows for federal funding to be available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, repairs or replacements of damaged facilities, and emergency protective measures in several counties. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has appointed Gregory A. Easton as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA at (202) 646-3272.
