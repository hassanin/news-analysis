During National Dyslexia Awareness Month, the US government is renewing efforts to support people with dyslexia and gain a deeper understanding of the disability. Dyslexia is a brain-based learning disability that affects an individual's ability to read and process language. It is one of the most prevalent language-based learning disabilities, affecting as many as one in five Americans. Undiagnosed cases of dyslexia can have negative effects on a person's self-confidence, learning, and development. Failing to identify dyslexia early on can create an achievement gap between dyslexic readers and their peers as early as the first grade. Many young Americans with dyslexia do not receive the resources they need, resulting in lower rates of literacy, higher rates of dropping out of school, unemployment, and incarceration. The US government is dedicated to working with schools and families to improve early identification of dyslexia and provide evidence-based solutions to children affected by the condition. Through research and work, the aim is to break down the barriers created by dyslexia and support individuals with the disability. Melania Trump also encourages Americans to learn more about dyslexia and raise awareness of the disorder. The goal is to ensure that every person suffering from dyslexia reaches their full potential and has the opportunity to pursue the American Dream.
