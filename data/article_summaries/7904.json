President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13818 will continue beyond December 20, 2021. The declaration was made to address the prevalence and severity of human rights abuse and corruption originating from outside the United States. These issues pose a threat to international political and economic systems, undermine democratic institutions, and have devastating impacts on individuals. The continuation of the national emergency is deemed necessary to protect national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States.
