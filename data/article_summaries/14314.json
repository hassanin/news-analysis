The First Lady, Michelle Obama, will be participating in a series of events throughout the month of March to support adolescent girls' education around the world. These events are in celebration of the first anniversary of Let Girls Learn and Women's History Month. Globally, over 62 million girls, more than half of whom are adolescents, are not in school due to various barriers. The First Lady will be welcoming young girls from Girl Up to tour The Girls' Lounge's "Let Girls Learn" bus at the White House on March 8th, in celebration of International Women's Day. She will also be attending an event at Union Market with U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power to mark the one year anniversary of Let Girls Learn and announce new private sector commitments in support of the initiative. On March 10th, the First Lady, along with Mrs. Sophie Gr√©goire Trudeau of Canada, will participate in a spousal program at the United States Institute of Peace to raise awareness for global girls' education. On March 16th, Mrs. Obama will address attendees at the SXSW Music Conference in Austin, Texas, to discuss Let Girls Learn and how students can take action on issues related to girls' education. During the President and First Lady's trip to Cuba and Argentina, Mrs. Obama will highlight Let Girls Learn and meet with young people to discuss education advocacy and community leadership. On March 29th, she will attend the 2016 Secretary of State's International Women of Courage Award, which recognizes women around the world who have shown exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for peace, justice, human rights, gender equality, and women's empowerment.
