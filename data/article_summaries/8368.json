The Biden-Harris Administration is taking executive action to address climate change and create jobs. President Biden will be signing several executive orders to tackle the climate crisis, promote clean energy, build sustainable infrastructure, and restore scientific integrity. The administration aims to achieve a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035 and a net-zero economy by 2050. The actions taken also prioritize the empowerment of American workers, the revitalization of the energy sector, conservation of natural resources, and environmental justice for impacted communities. Additionally, a presidential memorandum on scientific integrity will protect scientists from political interference and ensure evidence-based decision-making. The administration will also re-establish the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology to provide expert advice on policy related to science, technology, and innovation.
