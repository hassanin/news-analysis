The United States strongly condemns the recent attacks on innocent civilians attending church services in Kenya. These attacks, along with other recent incidents, demonstrate a lack of respect for human life and dignity. The perpetrators must be brought to justice. Peace and stability are crucial for Kenya's progress, and the US supports those who recognize the country's diversity as a strength. The US extends condolences to the victims' families and stands with the Kenyan people.
