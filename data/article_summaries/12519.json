Vice President Joe Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to discuss the implementation of President Poroshenko's peace plan. The Vice President praised Ukraine's unilateral declaration of a ceasefire and expressed concern that separatist leaders have not reciprocated. He also commended President Poroshenko's commitment to holding round-table discussions with civic leaders in eastern Ukraine. President Poroshenko informed the Vice President that Russian-backed separatists continue to attack Ukrainian forces, including with artillery, after the ceasefire declaration. The Vice President reiterated that the United States is working with its G-7 partners to prepare economic sanctions against Russia if Moscow does not take actions to stop the flow of arms and militants across the border and urge the separatists to lay down their arms.
