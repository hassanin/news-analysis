Maine has become the thirteenth state, along with the District of Columbia, to pass paid family and medical leave legislation. President Biden commended the leadership of Governor Janet Mills, Speaker of the House Rachel Talbot Ross, Senate President Troy Jackson, Representative Kristen Cloutier, Senator Mattie Daughtry, and other legislative sponsors, as well as state and community leaders, for making this achievement possible. Paid family and medical leave is seen as a way to improve the lives of working families and strengthen the workforce and economy. The Biden-Harris Administration supports a national paid family and medical leave program and applauds states like Maine for their progress on this issue.
