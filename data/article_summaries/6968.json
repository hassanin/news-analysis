President Biden is committed to creating an economy that works for every American, including families in Puerto Rico. In the past, the Child Tax Credit (CTC) only applied to families in Puerto Rico with three or more qualifying children, leaving only 10% of families eligible. However, the American Rescue Plan (ARP) signed by President Biden changed this, providing the largest Child Tax Credit nationwide and ensuring that families and children in Puerto Rico are fully benefited. Now, 97% of Puerto Rico families with children are eligible for the expanded CTC. The law also permanently changed the structure of the CTC, ensuring that every child in Puerto Rico will receive the credit on the same basis as all other American children. This will provide parents in Puerto Rico with more financial support and help reduce child poverty. Additionally, the ARP expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in Puerto Rico, potentially providing around $1 billion annually in benefits to low- and moderate-income working individuals and families. To encourage families in Puerto Rico to file their taxes and receive these benefits, First Lady Dr. Jill Biden, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, House Chairwoman Nydia Velazquez, Deputy Secretary of Treasury Wally Adeyemo, and American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling are holding a virtual event with various non-profit organizations. They are urging families to file their taxes by April 18th to take advantage of this critical aid. Overall, the ARP's expansions of the CTC and EITC are estimated to provide over $1 billion in tax relief per year for Puerto Rico families and benefit hundreds of thousands of children.
