During a press briefing aboard Air Force One, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan discussed the upcoming AUKUS partnership announcement between the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom. The leaders of the three countries will meet in San Diego to discuss the multi-phase process of the partnership, which includes training Australian personnel, rotational deployment of US and UK submarines in Australia, and the delivery of Virginia-class submarines to Australia. Sullivan emphasized that the AUKUS partnership reflects the US commitment to its core alliances in the Indo-Pacific region and the strategy of linking allies in the Atlantic with allies in the Pacific. He also mentioned the US-China relationship, stating that the US welcomes competition but does not seek conflict or a new Cold War. Sullivan also addressed other topics, such as President Xi's involvement in global affairs, the Iran-Saudi Arabia talks, and North Korea's recent submarine-launched ballistic missile tests. Additionally, Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre provided updates on the flooding in California and the President's planned gun reform event. She also addressed questions about the recent banking intervention and the President's engagement with economists and outside experts.
