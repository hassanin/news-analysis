President Biden has declared a major disaster in the state of Maine due to severe storm and flooding that occurred from October 30 to October 31, 2021. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. Federal funding will be available for emergency work, as well as the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in Knox, Waldo, and York counties. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also be eligible for cost-sharing funding. William F. Roy has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations, with the possibility of additional designations in the future based on further damage assessments.
