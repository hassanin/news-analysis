Hurricane Michael, a dangerous Category 4 storm, is about to hit the Florida Panhandle and is expected to move through Georgia and the Carolinas. The storm surge estimates are between 9 and 14 feet, and winds are expected to reach over 145 miles per hour. FEMA and other agencies are prepared for the storm and have search and rescue teams ready. The storm is projected to cause significant damage, particularly along the coast, and power outages are expected. The storm will also bring additional rainfall to South Carolina and North Carolina, exacerbating the flooding caused by Hurricane Florence. President Trump is closely monitoring the situation and has been in contact with state and local authorities. He expressed concern for those who were unable to evacuate due to financial reasons and said that the government is doing everything it can to help those affected by the storm. In a separate discussion, President Trump commented on the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, saying that the situation is a terrible thing and that the U.S. is taking it very seriously. He stated that he has spoken with the Saudi government at a high level and that the U.S. wants to get to the bottom of what happened. The President also mentioned that the U.S. is considering how to respond to India's purchase of the S-400 missile defense system from Russia.
