President Biden and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco announced additional steps the Administration is taking to combat gun crime. The President nominated Steve Dettelbach as the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), citing his experience as a former U.S. Attorney and career prosecutor. The Administration also issued a final rule to address the proliferation of "ghost guns," unserialized firearms that are increasingly recovered at crime scenes. The rule bans the manufacturing of easily accessible ghost guns and requires commercial manufacturers and sellers of these kits to become licensed and include serial numbers. Additionally, the rule mandates that federally licensed dealers and gunsmiths serialize any unserialized firearm they receive. The rule also clarifies that firearms with split receivers are subject to regulations requiring serial numbers and background checks. Furthermore, federally licensed firearms dealers are now required to retain key records until they shut down their business or licensed activity, instead of being allowed to destroy them after 20 years. These actions are part of President Biden's comprehensive gun crime reduction strategy, which includes executive actions and a call to Congress for funding and essential legislation to reduce gun crime.
