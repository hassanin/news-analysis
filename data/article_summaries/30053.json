In this op-ed piece, Sonny Perdue, the Secretary of Agriculture, argues that President Donald Trump is right to call out other countries for unfair trade practices. He states that American farmers have been disproportionately affected by retaliatory tariffs, and the Department of Agriculture is working to help them mitigate the damages. Perdue believes that instead of imposing tariffs, China should stop its unfair behavior. He concludes by stating that the Trump administration's support for farmers sends a clear message that China cannot bully the United States.
