President Donald J. Trump issued a proclamation on January 17, 2021, reaffirming his commitment to addressing educational inequity and promoting school choice. The proclamation highlights the fact that despite spending more money per pupil than other industrialized countries, a significant number of American students struggle with reading and math. The current system assigns students to schools based on where they live, limiting the choice of families who cannot afford to move or pay for private school tuition. This disproportionately affects racial minorities and distressed communities, perpetuating a cycle of poverty. President Trump calls for equal access to quality education for all students, regardless of their zip code. He has issued an Executive Order on Expanding Educational Opportunity through School Choice, providing in-person options for low-income parents during the pandemic. President Trump urges Congress to pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act, which would give over 1 million children the freedom to attend the school that best fits their needs and create tax credits for those who donate to local scholarship funds. He also calls for the passage of the School Choice Now Act, ensuring that every state can fund scholarship programs for elementary and high school students. President Trump believes that empowering families with the freedom and resources to make the best decisions for their children will lead to their success. He declares January 24 to January 30, 2021, as National School Choice Week.
