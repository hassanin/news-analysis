First Lady Melania Trump traveled to Arizona and visited a United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facility and a nonprofit social services center that is a grantee of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). She participated in a roundtable discussion with CBP Commissioner, border patrol agents, a member of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Removal Operations, the United States Marshal for Arizona, his deputy, and a local rancher. They discussed their experiences working along the border and the efforts made to keep America safe. Melania Trump toured the CBP facility, including areas where adult illegal immigrants and minors are housed. She was also briefed on the Joint Intelligence and Operations Center, which supports the Joint Task Force-West (JTF-W) in combating threats along the southwest border. In Phoenix, she visited Southwest Key Campbell, a shelter for unaccompanied alien children, where she met with staff and toured classrooms, game rooms, and a daycare room. Melania Trump expressed gratitude to law enforcement and care providers and called on Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform.
