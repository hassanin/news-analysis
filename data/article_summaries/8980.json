President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency regarding securities investments that finance certain companies of the People's Republic of China (PRC) will continue beyond November 12, 2022. The PRC is utilizing US capital to support the development of its military, intelligence, and security apparatuses, posing a threat to the United States. The PRC's military-industrial complex, which involves civilian Chinese companies supporting its military and intelligence activities, remains a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. The use of Chinese surveillance technology outside the PRC and its facilitation of repression or human rights abuses also pose threats to the United States. Therefore, President Biden has determined it is necessary to extend the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13959 and expanded in scope by Executive Order 14032.
