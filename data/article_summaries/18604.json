The President has issued a notice regarding the continuation of the national emergency regarding export control regulations. This emergency was declared in 2001 due to the expiration of the Export Administration Act of 1979. Since the Act has not been renewed by Congress, the national emergency must continue beyond August 17, 2010. The President is invoking the authority provided by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act to continue the national emergency for one year. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
