The White House has announced the release of Federal Agency Strategic Sustainability Performance Plans, which aim to achieve environmental, economic, and energy goals outlined in the Executive Order on Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy and Economic Performance. This is the first time agencies have developed and submitted Sustainability Plans. The plans prioritize sustainability actions based on positive return on investment and aim to meet energy, water, and waste reduction targets. The Federal government, being the largest energy consumer in the US economy, spent over $24.5 billion on electricity and fuel in 2008 alone. The Executive Order also requires agencies to set a 2020 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, increase energy efficiency, reduce fleet petroleum consumption, conserve water, reduce waste, support sustainable communities, and promote environmentally-responsible products and technologies through Federal purchasing power. Progress will be measured and reported online to promote accountability. Previous goals announced include a 28% reduction in direct greenhouse gas pollution and a 13% reduction in indirect greenhouse gas pollution by 2020. These goals could result in a cumulative reduction of 101 million metric tons of CO2 emissions.
