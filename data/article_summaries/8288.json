National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and officials from the National Security Council and State Department will travel to Brasilia, Brazil to meet with representatives of the administration of President Bolsonaro and members of the incoming administration of President-elect Lula da Silva. The discussions will focus on addressing common challenges such as combatting climate change, safeguarding food security, promoting inclusion and democracy, and managing regional migration. These meetings follow President Biden's call with President-elect Lula in October 2022, where they committed to maintaining open communication during the transition.
