President Donald Trump is using natural gas exports as a tool for trade policy, aiming to increase sales to China and other parts of Asia in order to create jobs and reduce trade deficits. The goal is to promote more liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports and not just use LNG as a geopolitical weapon against nations such as Russia. The Trump administration hopes this shift will help US LNG companies secure sales contracts in energy-hungry nations in Asia, addressing the trade deficit with China. The Obama administration was generally supportive of LNG development and exports, but did not prioritize it as a trade strategy. Trump sees LNG as a way to address bilateral trade deficits.
