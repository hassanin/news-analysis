Yesterday, the White House held a meeting with Latino leaders to discuss their priorities and how the Build Back Better agenda and pathway to citizenship would benefit Latino families. White House officials explained how the President's plan would lower healthcare costs, increase access to healthcare coverage, and provide two years of free college. The officials also expressed the President's desire to see a pathway to citizenship pass through reconciliation or other means. The Latino leaders shared what their organizations have done during the pandemic to support their communities and advocated for additional resources. They praised the administration's efforts in combating the pandemic but also expressed concerns about the need to vaccinate communities, including the healthcare benefits of a pathway to citizenship. The meeting is part of the White House's activities for Hispanic Heritage Month, which included a virtual discussion with Latino leaders in the President's Cabinet.
