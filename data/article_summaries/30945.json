President Trump gave remarks in the Rose Garden of the White House on November 21, 2017. He began by wishing everyone a happy and blessed Thanksgiving on behalf of Melania, Barron, and the Trump family. He then announced that he would be granting a presidential pardon to a turkey, continuing a long-standing American tradition. The turkey, named Drumstick, was raised on a farm in Minnesota and will be sent to "Gobbler's Rest," an enclosure on the campus of Virginia Tech. President Trump also mentioned that two other turkeys from Pennsylvania would be donated to a charity called Martha's Table, which provides meals to those in need. He expressed gratitude to the men and women in uniform, as well as the citizens of the country, and emphasized the importance of unity and trust among fellow Americans. Finally, he concluded his remarks and proceeded with the pardon.
