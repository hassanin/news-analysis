Since President Biden took office and implemented his Investing in America agenda, there has been significant growth in clean energy jobs and investments in the clean power sector. Private companies have announced plans for about 94 GW of new clean power generation projects, representing an estimated $133 billion in investment as of August 2023. These investments have led to the addition of 21,000 jobs in power generation and supply, with more than half of these job gains occurring between August 2022 and March 2023. Job growth has been particularly strong in electricity transmission and distribution, as well as in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power generation. The Department of Energy's U.S. Energy and Employment Report (USEER) also shows that clean energy job growth outpaced job growth in the energy sector overall, with clean energy jobs accounting for 40 percent of overall energy jobs in 2022. The report also highlights progress in increasing the representation of women in the energy workforce and the benefits of strong unions in the energy sector. The Biden administration's investments in clean power generation and its focus on creating good jobs and empowering workers are expected to support further innovation and job growth in the energy sector.
