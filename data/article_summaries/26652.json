In March 2019, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. The Golan Heights was taken by Israel in 1967 to protect itself from external threats, and today, acts by Iran and terrorist groups in southern Syria make it a potential launching ground for attacks on Israel. This proclamation acknowledges Israel's need to protect itself from Syria and other regional threats and recognizes the Golan Heights as part of the State of Israel.
