President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have announced the creation of a joint Task Force for Energy Security to reduce Europe's reliance on Russian fossil fuels and enhance European energy security. The task force will be led by representatives from the White House and the European Commission and will work towards ensuring energy security for Ukraine and the European Union (EU) in the coming winters. Additionally, the task force aims to support the EU's objective of reducing its dependence on Russian fossil fuels. It will focus on two main goals: diversifying liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies in line with climate objectives and reducing the demand for natural gas.
