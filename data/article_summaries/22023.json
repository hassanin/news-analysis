This executive order establishes the President's Advisory Council on Doing Business in Africa. The council aims to promote economic growth and job creation in the United States and Africa by encouraging U.S. companies to trade with and invest in Africa. The council will consist of private sector corporate members from various industries, appointed by the Secretary of Commerce. Its functions include advising the President on strengthening commercial engagement between the U.S. and Africa, creating jobs through trade and investment, developing strategies for U.S. private sector involvement in Africa, and facilitating infrastructure development and agricultural partnerships. The Department of Commerce will provide funding and administrative support for the council, and it will function for two years unless extended by the President. The executive order does not affect the authority of other executive departments or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
