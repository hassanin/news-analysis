President Barack Obama announced his intent to nominate Jacob J. Lew as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Lew, who currently serves as Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources, has extensive experience in both the public and private sectors. He previously served as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Clinton, during which time the U.S. budget operated at a surplus for three consecutive years. Lew's experience and expertise will be valuable in the administration's efforts to reduce the deficit and establish fiscal responsibility.
