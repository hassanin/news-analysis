President Biden has declared a major disaster in Virginia due to flooding, landslides, and mudslides that occurred from August 30 to August 31, 2021. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement recovery efforts in affected areas. Commonwealth, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, can receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures for the entire commonwealth are also eligible for federal funding. Timothy S. Pheil has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations, with the possibility of additional designations in the future based on further damage assessments.
