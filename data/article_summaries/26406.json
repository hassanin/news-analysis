The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has released its 2020 Drug-Free Communities (DFC) report, which shows that the program has been successful in reducing youth substance use rates. The report includes an Executive Summary and Annual Report for DFC grant recipients, who work at the local level to prevent youth substance use. The program focuses on educating youth about the dangers of substance use, including prescription drugs, marijuana, tobacco, and alcohol. The report highlights significant reductions in past 30-day substance use rates among youth living in areas served by DFC coalitions. The ONDCP applauds the efforts of the grant recipients and the investments made by the Trump Administration to support their work.
