The Interior, Energy, Commerce, and Transportation Departments in the US have announced new leasing, funding, and development goals to accelerate the deployment of offshore wind energy and create jobs. The White House convened leaders from these departments, along with state officials, industry executives, and labor leaders, to discuss the plan. The initiative aims to strengthen the domestic supply chain, create good-paying union jobs, and position the US as a leader in clean energy. President Biden's Executive Order called for expanding opportunities in the offshore wind industry, recognizing its potential for job creation and economic growth. The government will work closely with states, the private sector, unions, and other stakeholders to support the rapid deployment of offshore wind projects. The plan includes advancing ambitious wind energy projects, investing in American infrastructure, and supporting research and development.
