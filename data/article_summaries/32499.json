President Donald J. Trump has signed an executive order to dissolve the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. The commission had requested basic information from states regarding voter fraud, but many states refused to cooperate. Instead of engaging in legal battles, the President has asked the Department of Homeland Security to review the commission's initial findings and decide on future actions.
