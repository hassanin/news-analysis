Intel has announced plans to invest $20 billion in a new factory in Ohio, joining other companies in strengthening domestic supply chains for semiconductors in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of the global semiconductor supply chain, leading to a chip shortage that impacted various industries, including automotive. The Biden-Harris Administration has been working to expand chip manufacturing capacity, bring back American manufacturing jobs, and address supply chain disruptions. The investment by Intel will create thousands of construction and permanent jobs. The administration is also urging Congress to pass legislation to support research, development, and manufacturing for critical supply chains, including semiconductors. Since the beginning of 2021, the semiconductor industry has announced nearly $80 billion in new investments in the United States.
