This article is about an executive order issued by President Barack Obama on December 11, 2014. The order amends three previous executive orders: Executive Order 11030, Executive Order 13653, and Executive Order 13673. 

In Executive Order 11030, the amendments include changing the measurement unit from "inches" to "inch" and assigning responsibility for the preparation and presentation of proposed proclamations to appropriate agencies or offices.

A new section, Section 5, is added to address trade proclamations. It states that trade proclamations will be prepared by the United States Trade Representative and submitted to the Attorney General for consideration. If disapproved, the proclamation will not be presented to the President unless accompanied by a statement of reasons for disapproval.

Executive Order 13653, which deals with preparing the United States for the impacts of climate change, is amended in section 6(b) to include the Director of OMB as a key figure. Section 6(d) establishes a council structure and allows for the establishment of working groups.

In Executive Order 13673, the amendment changes the reference to the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act.

The general provisions of the order state that it does not affect the authority granted by law to agencies or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It also clarifies that the order does not create any rights or benefits enforceable at law.
