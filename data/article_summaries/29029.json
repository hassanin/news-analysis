President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Minnesota and ordered Federal assistance to aid in recovery efforts from severe storms and flooding that occurred from October 9 to October 11, 2018. This declaration allows for Federal funding to be provided to State and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures statewide are also eligible for Federal funding. Steven W. Johnson has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas, with the possibility of additional designations to be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
