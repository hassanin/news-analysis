The White House has launched the Healthy Campus Challenge, an initiative aimed at increasing enrollment in the Health Insurance Marketplace among young adults. The challenge encourages college and university campuses, particularly community college campuses, to undertake various outreach activities to reach uninsured individuals, especially young people. Participating campuses will need to fulfill a specific set of open enrollment outreach actions, such as hosting in-person enrollment events, sending reminder emails, using social media platforms, and partnering with community leaders. Campuses that complete all the actions will be recognized as White House Healthy Campuses and have a chance to be invited to Healthy Campus Day at the White House in January. The deadline for campus applications is November 1, 2016, and the challenge will run from November 1, 2016, to January 31, 2017.
