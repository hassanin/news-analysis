In a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney addressed several topics including the situation in Ukraine, the wage gap between men and women, immigration reform, and the Israeli-Palestinian talks. Carney expressed concern about the recent developments in Ukraine and stated that there is strong evidence suggesting that some of the pro-Russian demonstrators were paid and not local residents. He also mentioned that the White House is prepared to impose further sanctions on Russia if it takes further action in Ukraine. Regarding the wage gap between men and women, Carney stated that everyone at the White House is paid the same for the same work, regardless of gender. He acknowledged that there is work to be done to address the wage gap at a national level. Carney also discussed the need for comprehensive immigration reform and expressed the hope that Republicans in the House of Representatives would take action on this issue. Finally, he mentioned that the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations are ongoing and that the parties involved need to make difficult decisions in order to move the process forward.
