The U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in Washington, D.C. highlighted the importance of African leadership in addressing global peace, security, and democratic governance challenges. The Peace, Security, and Governance Forum discussed innovative approaches to advancing democracy, peace, and security in the region, emphasizing the need for partnerships based on mutual learning and collaboration with African nations. The Civil Society Forum focused on increasing representation of marginalized voices, countering corruption, and promoting workers' rights. The United States reaffirmed its commitment to supporting civil society and demonstrated the benefits of accountable and inclusive government. A balanced and comprehensive approach that includes defense, diplomacy, and development, while integrating African voices, is necessary for sustainable democracy and security. The United States has invested over $6.5 billion to support peace, security, democracy, human rights, and governance in Africa, including efforts to develop military capabilities, support peacekeeping, advance women's rights, promote gender equality and human rights, empower civil society, strengthen accountability, and support democratic transitions and institutions.
