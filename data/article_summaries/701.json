The United States and the United Kingdom, along with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, and the Netherlands, conducted joint strikes against Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen. The strikes were in response to ongoing and escalating Iranian-enabled Houthi attacks against commercial shipping in the Red Sea. The targets focused on Houthi missile, radar, and UAV capabilities. These attacks have directly affected more than 50 countries, rerouting vessels and impacting the global economy. The U.N. Security Council issued a resolution condemning the attacks and the primary supplier of arms and assistance to the Houthis, Iran. The collective action aims to disrupt and degrade Houthi capabilities to threaten global trade and freedom of navigation. The Houthis claim their attacks are tied to the conflict in Gaza, but the U.S. and its allies see it as a baseless and illegitimate claim. The strikes were conducted with precision-guided munitions to minimize collateral damage. The U.S. and UK forces remain prepared to defend themselves and continue to contribute to the defense of maritime traffic in the region. The extent to which the strikes have degraded Houthi capabilities is not disclosed, but it is expected to diminish their capacity to conduct further attacks. Iran is held responsible for its support and sponsorship of the Houthis, and there is ongoing pressure on Iran through a longstanding pressure campaign. The U.S. and its allies are prepared for potential retaliatory actions from the Houthis. Specific details about the targets, the success of the strikes, and collateral damage will be provided by Central Command. Further actions may be taken if necessary to protect people and international commerce.
