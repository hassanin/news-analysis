This article is a presidential memorandum issued by President Donald Trump on March 27, 2019. The memorandum addresses the urgent need for reform in the housing finance system of the United States. It mentions the significant losses suffered by the Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, during the financial crisis of 2008, and their subsequent placement into conservatorship. The memorandum emphasizes the lack of comprehensive housing finance reform since the crisis and the potential risks faced by taxpayers and federal housing finance programs. The President directs the Secretary of the Treasury to develop a plan for administrative and legislative reforms to achieve housing reform goals such as ending the conservatorships of the GSEs, promoting competition in the housing finance market, safeguarding their safety and soundness, and ensuring proper compensation for any support provided by the Federal Government. The plan also aims to preserve access to mortgage options, maintain equal access to the federal housing finance system, establish capital and liquidity requirements for the GSEs, increase private sector participation, mitigate risks, and define the GSEs' role in multifamily mortgage finance. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development is also directed to develop a plan for administrative and legislative reforms to modernize the operations and technology of the FHA and GNMA, reduce taxpayer exposure, and address various specific objectives. The memorandum includes general provisions and clarifies that it does not create any substantive or procedural rights or benefits.
