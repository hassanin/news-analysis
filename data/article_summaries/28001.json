President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Sudan, which was declared in Executive Order 13067, will continue beyond November 3, 2018. Despite some positive developments, the actions and policies of the Sudanese government still pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Trump has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
