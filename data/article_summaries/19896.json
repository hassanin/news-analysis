The White House has announced the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Yemen. This declaration was made in accordance with Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, which states that a national emergency automatically terminates unless the President publishes a notice stating that it will continue. The national emergency was initially declared in Executive Order 13611 on May 16, 2012. The President has determined that the actions and policies of certain members of the Yemeni government and others still pose a threat to Yemen's peace, security, and stability. These actions include obstructing the implementation of the 2011 agreement between the Yemeni government and opposition groups for a peaceful transition of power. Therefore, the national emergency with respect to Yemen will continue beyond May 16, 2016.
