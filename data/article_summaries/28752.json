President Donald Trump has issued a notice to continue the national emergency with respect to Somalia. The national emergency was initially declared in 2010 due to the deterioration of the security situation and the persistence of violence in Somalia, as well as acts of piracy and armed robbery off the coast. Additional steps were taken in 2012 to address the exports of charcoal, the misappropriation of Somali public assets, and acts of violence against civilians. The national emergency is being extended for another year, as the situation in Somalia continues to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
