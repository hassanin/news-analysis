The article is an executive order issued by President Joe Biden on January 20, 2021. The order establishes an ethics pledge for appointees in executive agencies. Every appointee appointed on or after January 20, 2021, is required to sign the pledge, which commits them to conduct themselves ethically and in the public interest. The pledge includes commitments such as not accepting gifts from lobbyists, not participating in matters involving former employers or clients, and abiding by post-employment restrictions. The order also provides definitions for various terms used in the pledge and establishes procedures for enforcement and waivers. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with the Counsel to the President, has the authority to grant written waivers in certain circumstances. The order also assigns responsibilities to agency heads and the Director of the Office of Government Ethics to ensure compliance with the pledge. Violations of the pledge can result in penalties, such as debarment from lobbying and civil actions. The order includes general provisions and is subject to applicable law and appropriations.
