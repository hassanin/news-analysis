President Barack Obama has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Lebanon, which was declared in Executive Order 13441 in 2007, is to continue beyond August 1, 2014. This decision is based on ongoing activities, such as arms transfers to Hizballah, which undermine Lebanese sovereignty, contribute to instability in the region, and pose a threat to US national security and foreign policy. Therefore, President Obama has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
