The Senate has confirmed Judge Robert Wilkins to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Judge Wilkins has a background as a public defender and in private practice. He has also played a role in establishing the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. President Obama nominated him in 2010 to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, where he has served with impartiality and integrity. With Judge Wilkins' confirmation, the D.C. Circuit now has a full bench to ensure fair and swift justice.
