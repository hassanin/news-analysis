President Barack Obama has proclaimed April 2nd as World Autism Awareness Day. He recognizes the millions of individuals worldwide who live with autism spectrum disorder and celebrates the ways in which they contribute to society. In the United States, 1 in 68 children have autism, and it is important to ensure that they have access to the necessary resources and programs. The Affordable Care Act prohibits health insurance companies from denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions such as autism, and it also requires insurance plans to cover preventive services for autism screenings. The Autism CARES Act of 2014 was signed to enhance training and educational opportunities for professionals serving individuals with autism. The BRAIN Initiative continues to invest in research to improve understanding and the lives of those with autism. President Obama encourages all Americans to learn more about autism and support individuals on the autism spectrum and their families.
