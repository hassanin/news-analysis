President Joe Biden has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia, which was declared in 1995, will continue beyond October 21, 2022. The circumstances that led to the declaration of the national emergency have not been resolved, and the actions of these narcotics traffickers continue to pose a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, as well as causing violence, corruption, and harm domestically and internationally. Therefore, President Biden has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
