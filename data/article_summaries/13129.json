The White House is planning to draw down troops in Afghanistan. The President will announce that 10,000 troops will be brought out of Afghanistan by the end of this year, and the full 33,000 troops associated with the West Point surge will be out of Afghanistan by next summer. The President will also mention the progress made against al Qaeda and the Taliban, and the need for Pakistan to continue its counterterrorism efforts. The President will also discuss the importance of transitioning the security responsibility to Afghan forces and the need for a political settlement. The President will also mention the war in Iraq and the efforts to wind down that war. The NATO summit will be held in Chicago next May to discuss the next phase of transition in Afghanistan. The President has made this decision based on the progress made in Afghanistan and the need to responsibly end the war.
