This memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama on January 18, 2011, addresses the importance of regulatory compliance and transparency in government. The memorandum directs executive departments and agencies to develop plans to make information about their regulatory compliance and enforcement activities accessible, downloadable, and searchable online within 120 days. The goal is to promote accountability, encourage collaboration, and provide the public with information about their government's activities. Greater disclosure of regulatory compliance information is seen as essential in fostering fair and consistent enforcement, promoting public safety, improving working conditions, and protecting the environment. The memorandum also calls for the sharing of enforcement and compliance information across agencies to promote flexible and coordinated enforcement regimes. It is important to note that the memorandum does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities.
