The United States and Mexico have recognized the advancements in their partnership and the entry into force of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a free trade agreement that aims to promote economic growth and prosperity for both countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply affected both nations, and they continue to coordinate closely in response to the health, security, and economic challenges. Since March 2020, movement at the shared land border has been restricted to essential travel only, while ensuring the flow of critical goods and services. Mexico became the largest goods trading partner of the United States in 2019, with $1.6 billion worth of trade crossing the border daily. The USMCA provides economic certainty and increased confidence, which is critical for the recovery of both nations. It also strengthens cooperation in fighting corruption. The agreement marks the beginning of a new era that will benefit workers, farmers, engineers, and entrepreneurs of both countries. The statement was signed by Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, and Andrés Manuel López Obrador, President of Mexico, on July 8, 2020.
