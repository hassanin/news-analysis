The White House Office of the Press Secretary has released a fact sheet announcing the designation of 12 new communities to receive federal support through the Investing in Manufacturing Communities Partnership (IMCP). The IMCP is an initiative led by the U.S. Department of Commerce that aims to transform American communities into globally competitive manufacturing hubs. These designated communities have developed strong economic development plans and partnerships between the public and private sectors. They will receive federal support, including funding and a federal liaison, to attract private investment and partnerships. The fact sheet also highlights the progress made by the first round of designated communities, including increased investment and job growth. The 12 newly designated communities include Greater Pittsburgh, San Antonio, Louisiana Chemical Corridor, Madison, Mid-South Manufacturing Alliance, Greater Peoria, Minnesota Medical Manufacturing Partnership, South Central Idaho, Utah Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Initiative, Pacific Northwest Partnership Region, Connecticut Advanced Manufacturing Communities Region, and Central Valley AgPlus Food and Beverage Manufacturing Consortium.
