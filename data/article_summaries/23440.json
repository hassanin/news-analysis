The United States is condemning the recent violence in the Abyei region of Sudan and calling on leaders from both Northern and Southern Sudan to prevent future attacks and restore calm. The presence of forces from both sides in Abyei is in violation of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement and hinders efforts to reach agreement on the region's final status. The Government of Sudan is urged to choose the path of peace and fulfill its commitments, while the Government of South Sudan must also resolve remaining contentious issues. The United States welcomes the commitment to establish a committee in Abyei to review security arrangements and urges its immediate presence and completion of a security assessment. Both North and South Sudan are called upon to provide full access to the UN Mission in Sudan to fulfill its mandate of assessing the security and humanitarian situation and protecting civilians. Presidents Bashir and Kiir are urged to meet and make urgent progress in talks to resolve Abyei's final status in a manner that addresses the needs of all communities and upholds the Abyei Protocol and the ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration.
