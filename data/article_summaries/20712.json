President Obama congratulates President Medvedev and his government on completing negotiations for Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). This is a significant day for U.S.-Russia relations and for a rules-based global economy. Russia's membership in the WTO will lower tariffs, improve international access to Russia's services markets, and hold the Russian government accountable to trade behavior rules. It will also generate more exports for American manufacturers and farmers, creating well-paying jobs. Russia's membership in the WTO will benefit American companies by integrating Russia into a system of rules governing trade behavior and providing mechanisms to enforce those rules. The United States will be able to use WTO mechanisms to challenge Russia's actions that are inconsistent with WTO rules. Russia's WTO accession is seen as another important step forward in the reset of relations with Russia, highlighting the ability to cooperate on economic issues of mutual interest.
