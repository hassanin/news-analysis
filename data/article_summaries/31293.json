President Trump recently delivered remarks at the Department of Energy, outlining his administration's plans to promote strength and innovation in America's energy sector. He emphasized the goal of not just achieving energy independence, but also energy dominance. The President listed six concrete steps his administration is taking to achieve this goal, including reviving and expanding the nuclear energy sector, addressing barriers to financing overseas coal energy plants, approving the construction of a new petroleum pipeline to Mexico, signing an agreement for the sale of American natural gas to South Korea, approving applications to export additional natural gas, and creating a new offshore Oil and Gas Leasing program. These steps aim to benefit the American people by reducing vulnerability to foreign regimes, providing access to cheaper energy, and creating more jobs and opportunities. The President called this the beginning of the Golden Era of American Energy.
