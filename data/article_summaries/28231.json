President Donald Trump has authorized $4.5 million in direct support to the Syria Civil Defense (SCD) to continue the United States' support for their work in the country. The SCD has rescued over 115,000 people, including ethnic and religious minorities, during the 8-year conflict in Syria. The United States is urging its allies and partners to join them in supporting the SCD and protecting civilians and innocent victims of the Syrian conflict.
