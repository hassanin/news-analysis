On April 14, 2015, the White House Office of the Press Secretary released a statement regarding the proposed rescission of Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. The statement, certified by President Barack Obama, declares that the Government of Cuba has not provided any support for international terrorism in the preceding six months and has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future. This certification satisfies the provisions of certain sections of the Export Administration Act of 1979, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, and the Arms Export Control Act.
