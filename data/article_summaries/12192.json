President Barack Obama has proclaimed the establishment of the Basin and Range National Monument in southeastern Nevada. The area is known for its unique and undisturbed landscape, which includes basins, faults, and ranges. The region has significant geological features, such as natural arches, caves, and cliffs, as well as evidence of an ancient impact from space. It is also home to a diverse range of ecosystems, including sagebrush communities, grasslands, and arid areas with various cactus species. The monument provides important habitat for a variety of animal species, including desert bighorn sheep, mule deer, elk, pronghorn, lizards, snakes, birds, and amphibians. The area also has a rich cultural history, with evidence of human habitation dating back thousands of years. It was explored by European-Americans in the 19th century and has a history of mining and ranching. The monument encompasses approximately 704,000 acres of federal land and is managed by the Bureau of Land Management as part of the National Landscape Conservation System. The proclamation ensures the protection of the area's natural, scientific, and historic values and provides for the development of a management plan with public involvement.
