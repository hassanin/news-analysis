In September 2018, Second Lady Karen Pence launched an awareness campaign to support military spouses and address their unique employment challenges. Since then, Mrs. Pence has traveled to various locations to meet with military spouses, business leaders, and government officials to advocate for better career opportunities. Military spouses often face difficulties in finding employment due to frequent relocations and the need to obtain new licenses or certifications with each move. Currently, one third of military spouses work in fields that require state licenses, and they face a high unemployment rate of 24%. Mrs. Pence has emphasized the importance of occupational licensing reforms to improve career options for military spouses. Her campaign has focused on raising awareness about these challenges by engaging businesses, nonprofits, and local communities.
