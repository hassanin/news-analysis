The article discusses the costs of criminal activity in the United States and the need for criminal justice reform to lower recidivism rates. It states that in 2016, 1.4 percent of the nation's GDP was spent on funding the criminal justice system, and the total burden of crime, including damages to victims and society, amounted to 2.9 percent of GDP or roughly $500 billion.

The article emphasizes the importance of government investment in prison education to help reintegrate prisoners into society and reduce the burden of criminal activity. Overall, the article supports bipartisan and evidence-based prison reforms to improve the criminal justice system and reduce recidivism rates.
