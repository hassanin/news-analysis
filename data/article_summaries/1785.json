Today, key White House officials, including Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice and White House Public Engagement Director Cedric Richmond, held a virtual roundtable listening session with Asian American and Pacific Islander advocates and community leaders. The purpose of the session was to address the increasing rates of anti-Asian harassment and violence and discuss the climate of fear that Asian American communities are currently facing. Participants shared their perspectives on the issue and highlighted the important work they are doing to prevent and address violence against Asian American communities. They also emphasized the importance of coalition building across communities. Ambassador Rice and Congressman Richmond expressed gratitude for the participants' leadership and reiterated President Biden's commitment to ending anti-Asian violence and bias. They also emphasized the administration's policy to condemn and combat xenophobia against Asian Americans. President Biden has charged the Department of Justice with partnering with Asian American communities to prevent and collect data on hate crimes, and has directed federal agencies to mitigate anti-Asian bias in their official actions.
