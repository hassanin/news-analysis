President Donald J. Trump will award the Medal of Honor to David G. Bellavia for his actions on November 10, 2004, while serving as a Staff Sergeant in the United States Army. Bellavia was clearing a block of houses when his platoon became pinned down in Fallujah, Iraq. He exchanged his M16 rifle for an M249 Squad Automatic Weapon and entered the house where his squad was trapped. He engaged insurgents, providing cover fire for his fellow soldiers to exit safely. He re-entered the house armed with an M16 and assaulted insurgents who were firing rocket-propelled grenades. Bellavia killed one insurgent and wounded another, and then engaged another insurgent rushing down the stairs. He killed both attackers and pursued an insurgent up the stairs, killing him as well. Bellavia moved to the roof, engaged and wounded a fifth insurgent who fell from the roof. He rescued his squad, cleared an insurgent strongpoint, and saved many members of his platoon. Bellavia enlisted in the Army in 1999 and was released from duty in 2005. He now has a daily radio talk show and continues to serve the military and veteran communities through philanthropic organizations. The Medal of Honor is awarded to members of the Armed Forces who show gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of their own lives above and beyond the call of duty.
