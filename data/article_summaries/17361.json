President Obama and Vice President Biden announced the release of $28 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to repair and build highways, roads, and bridges. This investment is expected to create or save 150,000 jobs by the end of 2010. State highway departments have already identified over 100 transportation projects totaling more than $750 million that can begin construction within the month. The U.S. Department of Transportation will monitor state compliance and track job creation, and information on the projects will be posted on Recovery.gov. The investment in transportation infrastructure is part of the administration's efforts to jumpstart the economy and put Americans back to work. The President emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability in using taxpayer money and appointed an Inspector General to root out waste and fraud. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act-funded projects will bear a newly-designed emblem to symbolize the administration's commitment to investing tax dollars wisely.
