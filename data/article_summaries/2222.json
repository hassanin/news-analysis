In a statement from the State Dining Room, President Biden announced that the U.S. economy added 431,000 jobs in March, bringing the total number of jobs created during his presidency to 7.9 million. He highlighted the fact that the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.6 percent, the fastest decline at the start of a presidential term in history. The President attributed these positive economic indicators to the American Rescue Plan and the infrastructure law, which he said have helped to get Americans vaccinated, reopen schools, and stimulate job growth. He also acknowledged the need to address rising prices, particularly due to the global impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and announced the release of 1 million barrels per day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. President Biden emphasized the importance of getting America's fiscal house in order and reducing the federal deficit, which he claimed his administration is on track to achieve. He proposed implementing a Billionaire Minimum Tax to ensure that the wealthy pay their fair share. Overall, the President expressed confidence in the progress being made and the resilience of the American economy.
