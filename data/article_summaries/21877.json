This article is a presidential proclamation by Barack Obama, celebrating the 50th anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid. The proclamation highlights how these programs have become integral to American society, providing healthcare as a right and not a privilege. It acknowledges that before the establishment of Medicare and Medicaid, many Americans, particularly seniors, children, and people with disabilities, did not have access to affordable healthcare. The proclamation emphasizes the progress made in healthcare affordability and accessibility through the Affordable Care Act, such as the expansion of Medicaid and the provision of preventive health services. The president also pledges to further strengthen these programs by extending the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund, aligning payments with the value of care, and reducing prescription drug costs. Obama calls on Americans to continue the legacy of Medicare and Medicaid by ensuring affordable healthcare for future generations. The proclamation designates July 30, 2015, as the 50th Anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid and encourages appropriate ceremonies and activities to recognize the importance of these programs.
