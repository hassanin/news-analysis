The Biden-Harris Administration has released a report outlining new actions to strengthen protections for vulnerable workers in the H-2B program, which allows employers to temporarily hire noncitizens for nonagricultural labor in the United States. The report addresses challenges such as threats to program integrity, the vulnerability of H-2B workers, and the illegal use of the program to avoid hiring U.S. workers. The Taskforce held listening sessions and gathered recommendations from various stakeholders to develop these actions. The report includes more than a dozen action items to be taken by federal agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security, Labor, and State, as well as the U.S. Agency for International Development. These actions aim to improve outcomes, strengthen program integrity, and better protect workers in the H-2B and H-2A programs.
