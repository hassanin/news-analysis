The Trump administration is exploring new approaches for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by engaging with a budding Sunni Arab coalition consisting of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Jordan. Jared Kushner, along with special envoy Jason D. Greenblatt and deputy national security adviser Dina Powell, recently visited the leaders of these four countries. They expressed hope that the new generation of Arab leaders could be a potential "game-changer" for peace in the Middle East. The administration aims to broker a reunification of Gaza with the Palestinian Authority, under the leadership of President Mahmoud Abbas, in order to represent all Palestinians. The strategy involves an "outside-in" approach, with the United States eventually bringing together Israelis and leaders of major Arab states for a peace conference. The Gaza opening by moderate Arab nations is a result of their feud with Qatar, Turkey, and other countries supporting Hamas. The larger vision is to restart the Palestinian peace process by leveraging the alliance of moderate Sunni leaders. The opportunities for trade, investment, and security cooperation between Israel and the Arab nations have never been greater.
