The United States government has condemned the life sentence issued against American citizen Mohamed Soltan in Egypt and is calling for his immediate release from prison. They express deep concern for Soltan's health, which has deteriorated during his 20-month incarceration. The President is committed to the well-being of all U.S. citizens abroad and will ensure that Soltan receives consular support until he can safely return to the United States.
