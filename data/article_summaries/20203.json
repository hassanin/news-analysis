President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Texas due to severe storms and flooding. Federal aid will be provided to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected area. The declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals and counties for temporary housing, home repairs, and low-cost loans. Federal funding is also available for emergency protective measures and hazard mitigation statewide. FEMA will continue damage surveys in other areas, and more counties may be designated for assistance. Residents and business owners can apply for assistance online or by phone.
