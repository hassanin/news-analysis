Vice President Biden announced the selection of 25 communities to receive over $452 million in funds for energy-efficient building renovations. The program, called Retrofit Ramp-Up, will bring together communities, governments, private companies, and nonprofit organizations to work on extensive renovation projects. These projects are expected to save homeowners and businesses approximately $100 million annually and create around 30,000 jobs over the next three years. The selected communities will use innovative financing models to make energy savings available to residents, such as low or no-interest loans paid through property taxes and utility bills. The projects aim to reduce energy consumption, carbon emissions, and utility costs, while also stimulating economic growth. The announcement is part of a series of events and activities organized by the government to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Earth Day.
