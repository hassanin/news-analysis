Former Japanese Prime Minister, Abe Shinzo, has been shot and killed while campaigning, leaving many stunned, outraged, and saddened. As Vice President, Joe Biden had the privilege of working closely with Abe and recognizes him as a champion of the alliance between Japan and the United States. Abe's vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific will continue to be remembered. He dedicated his life to the service of the Japanese people and was engaged in the work of democracy at the moment of the attack. While details are still unclear, violent attacks and gun violence are never acceptable, leaving deep scars on affected communities. The United States stands with Japan in this time of grief, and Biden extends his deepest condolences to Abe's family.
