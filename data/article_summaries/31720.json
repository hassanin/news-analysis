This executive order, issued on December 8, 2020, focuses on healthcare and COVID-19 vaccines. The purpose of the order is to ensure that Americans have priority access to free, safe, and effective COVID-19 vaccines. It emphasizes the importance of collaboration between the United States Government, industry, and international partners to make these vaccines available. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, in coordination with other relevant departments and agencies, is tasked with ensuring the timely distribution of vaccines to the American people and prioritizing access for vulnerable populations. Once there is a sufficient supply of vaccines for Americans, the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and State, along with other agencies, will facilitate international access to these vaccines for allies, partners, and others. Within 30 days, an interagency strategy will be developed to coordinate the implementation of international access. The order also includes general provisions stating that it does not affect existing authorities or create any new rights or benefits enforceable against the United States or its entities.
