The President made phone calls to Senator Reid and Speaker Boehner to get an update on negotiations over funding for fiscal year 2011. He will monitor progress and call another meeting at the White House if necessary. The President is open to a short-term continuing resolution (CR) if an agreement is close and just a few more days are needed for paperwork. He will call a meeting at any time if he believes progress is not being made to avoid a government shutdown. The President and Democrats have shown a willingness to accept significant spending cuts, but they believe the focus should be on funding for education, medical research, and Head Start, rather than earmarks or unnecessary military spending. The President's trip to Philadelphia will focus on issues that Americans care about, such as gas prices and energy policy. There was a letter from Qaddafi appealing to Obama to halt the NATO campaign, but the President has made it clear that actions, not words, are needed for a ceasefire. The President had a video conference with President Karzai, but there is no information on the meeting at this time. The White House is not negotiating the elements of the budget agreement, but they believe the $73 billion in spending cuts that they have shown a willingness to accept is a significant compromise. They believe the issue is about the composition of the cuts and the choices that need to be made based on priorities.
