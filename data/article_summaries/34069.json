The Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment situation report, revealing that in September, the United States added 661,000 jobs and the unemployment rate dropped to 7.9 percent. Since the start of the pandemic, 52 percent of job losses have been recovered, and the country has gained over 11.4 million jobs. The recovery has been focused on low-earning industries such as retail trade and leisure and hospitality, which employ many minorities and individuals without college degrees. The leisure and hospitality sector has seen the return of over 4.5 million jobs, while the retail trade sector has gained nearly 1.9 million jobs. Manufacturing and construction industries have also experienced strong recoveries. Wages for manufacturing production and nonsupervisory employees grew faster during President Trump's expansion period compared to former President Obama's. Unemployment rates for minorities and historically disadvantaged Americans have fallen since April. The recovery has been historically unprecedented, with the unemployment rate falling by 6.8 percentage points in the past five months, which is significantly faster than previous recoveries.
