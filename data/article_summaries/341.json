President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has published a notice stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13873 on May 15, 2019, regarding the security of the information and communications technology and services supply chain, will continue beyond May 15, 2022. The unrestricted acquisition or use of information and communications technology or services from foreign adversaries poses a significant threat to national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the United States. Therefore, it has been determined that it is necessary to extend the national emergency in order to secure the information and communications technology and services supply chain.
