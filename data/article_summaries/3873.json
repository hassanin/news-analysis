President Biden delivered a statement in response to the Supreme Court's decision to uphold a Texas law that effectively bans most abortions in the state. He expressed his disappointment and called it a sad day for the Court and the country. He emphasized the importance of Roe v. Wade, which protected a woman's right to choose and made personal decisions free from political interference. President Biden stated that the Court's decision puts the health and life of women at risk, as state laws banning abortion are now taking effect. He criticized the Court for taking away a constitutional right and called it a deliberate effort to upset the balance of law. He called on Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade as federal law and urged voters to elect officials who will protect a woman's right to choose. President Biden also pledged to protect a woman's access to medications approved by the FDA and ensure politicians cannot interfere in decisions made between a woman and her doctor. He warned that the decision could have broader implications for the right to privacy and called for peaceful protests against the decision. President Biden expressed his support for women facing difficult situations and vowed to use all appropriate lawful powers to address the issue, but emphasized that Congress must act and urged voters to have the final word.
