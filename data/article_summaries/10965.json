President Obama met with Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) business and faith leaders to discuss the importance of passing commonsense immigration reform. The President urged the House of Representatives to follow the bipartisan example of the Senate and pass immigration reform. Both the President and the leaders agreed that immigration reform would benefit the AAPI community by supporting business leaders and entrepreneurs and keeping families together. The President expressed concern about the pain caused by the separation of families due to the broken immigration system and noted that the Secretary of Homeland Security is reviewing enforcement practices to make them more humane. The President emphasized that while his Administration can take steps to enforce and administer immigration laws, legislative reform is needed for a permanent solution.
