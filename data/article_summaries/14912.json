The White House has announced the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Somalia. This emergency was initially declared in 2010 due to the deteriorating security situation, violence, acts of piracy, and violations of the arms embargo in Somalia. In 2012, additional measures were taken to address the export of charcoal, misappropriation of Somali public assets, and acts of violence against civilians. The White House has determined that the situation in Somalia still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency will continue for another year. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
