National Security Advisor to the Vice President, Dr. Phil Gordon, recently hosted a strategy session with Partnership for Central America (PCA) leaders, CEOs from companies that have responded to the Vice President's Call to Action for Northern Central America, and a team of senior U.S. government officials. The session aimed to discuss an updated framework for driving progress under the collaborative partnership, building upon the more than $3.2 billion in investments mobilized during the first year of the initiative. The participants focused on next steps in the Call to Action, including advancing good governance, anti-corruption, and labor priorities as part of the broader U.S. Strategy to Address the Root Causes of Migration. Additionally, they explored ways the U.S. government could further support private sector investments in response to the Call to Action.
