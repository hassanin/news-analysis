This Presidential Memorandum, issued on January 29, 2020, delegates certain authority to the Secretary of Defense under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute. The memorandum states that the national security interests of the United States require expedient decision-making and that the Department of Defense needs flexibility to respond to threats and protect the American people. It asserts that when collective bargaining is incompatible with the mission of the Department of Defense, it should not be forced to sacrifice national security and can seek relief through third parties and administrative fora. The Secretary of Defense is delegated authority to issue orders excluding Department of Defense agencies from Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute coverage, and this authority may be further delegated to other officials within the Department. The determination made by the Secretary or other officials must be published in the Federal Register. The memorandum includes general provisions stating that it does not impair the authority of executive departments or agencies, or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and that it must be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. The memorandum does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
