The White House has released updated fact sheets for each state and territory in the United States, highlighting the impact of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This legislation, which is the largest long-term investment in infrastructure in nearly a century, aims to repair roads and bridges, improve transportation options, expand the network of electric vehicle chargers, provide reliable high-speed internet for all Americans, eliminate lead service lines for clean drinking water, protect against extreme weather events and cyberattacks, and improve the nation's airports. The fact sheets provide information on how the legislation will benefit each state and territory. Additional data on the impact of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is expected to be released in the coming days and weeks.
