President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed October 17 through October 23, 2021, as National Forest Products Week in the United States. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of forests in supporting the livelihoods of people, providing jobs, clean air and water, renewable materials and energy, and recreational opportunities. However, it also acknowledges the challenges forests face due to climate change, such as wildfires, droughts, floods, and insect outbreaks. President Biden's administration is committed to addressing these challenges through the "America the Beautiful" initiative, which aims to conserve at least 30 percent of the country's lands and waters by 2030. Forest restoration is highlighted as a means to create jobs, reduce wildfire risks, restore ecosystem function, and combat the climate crisis. The administration supports community-driven conservation and restoration efforts, as well as business opportunities that advance forest conservation and create jobs. Investments are proposed in sustainable and innovative uses for wood waste materials to produce advanced biofuels, biochar, heat, and power. Overall, the proclamation emphasizes the need to sustainably steward forests to meet the nation's needs and enhance the lives of future generations.
