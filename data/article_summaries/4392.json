The article criticizes Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy for not advocating for the wealthy and powerful to pay their fair share of taxes during a speech on Wall Street. Instead, he proposed cuts to important programs that benefit working- and middle-class Americans. The article argues that McCarthy and MAGA officials are pushing for more tax giveaways that primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans and big corporations. The author concludes that this approach is essentially a rebranding of trickle-down economics, but even worse.
