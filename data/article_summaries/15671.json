This article provides background information on the presentation of portraits of President George W. Bush and Mrs. Laura Welch Bush. President Bush's portrait shows him standing in the Oval Office, with his hand resting on an armchair made for the White House in 1818. A corner of the "Resolute desk" can be seen behind him, along with a painting called "A Charge to Keep" by William H. D. Koerner. Mrs. Bush's portrait is set in the Green Room, wearing a midnight blue gown and resting her hand on a lyreback armchair attributed to Duncan Phyfe. The portraits were painted by John Howard Sanden, a well-known portrait artist. The White House Historical Association commissioned the portraits and will donate them to the White House. President Bush selected Sanden for his portrait in 2010, and Mrs. Bush followed suit for her portrait in 2012.
