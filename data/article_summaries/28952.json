On October 26, 2020, President Donald Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum regarding foreign policy. The memorandum certifies that the Government of Sudan has not supported acts of international terrorism in the past six months and has provided assurances that it will not support such acts in the future. This certification satisfies provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the Arms Export Control Act, and the Export Administration Act of 1979. The memorandum was signed by President Trump at the White House.
