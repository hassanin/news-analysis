On June 16, 2014, President Barack Obama sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, informing them that approximately 275 U.S. Armed Forces personnel were being deployed to Iraq. The purpose of this deployment was to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. The force was equipped for combat and would remain in Iraq until the security situation improved. The President stated that this action was taken to protect U.S. citizens and property, and was consistent with his constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive. He also mentioned that he was providing this report in accordance with the War Powers Resolution, and appreciated the support of Congress in these actions.
