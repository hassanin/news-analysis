President Obama has transmitted a Supplementary Agreement to Congress that modifies the Agreement on Social Security between the United States and the Czech Republic. The Supplementary Agreement is intended to account for a new Czech domestic health insurance law and exempts U.S. citizen workers and multinational companies from contributing to the Czech health insurance system. The U.S.-Czech Social Security Agreement, as amended, will continue to contain all provisions mandated by the Social Security Act. President Obama has recommended the Supplementary Agreement and related documents to Congress.
