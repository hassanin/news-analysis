The President has rescinded his previous memorandum on transgender service in the military and has allowed Secretary Mattis to implement a new policy. This new policy was developed through extensive study by senior uniformed and civilian leaders, including combat veterans, and aims to enhance the military's readiness, lethality, and effectiveness. The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security have concluded, based on the advice of experts, that allowing individuals with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria, who may require substantial medical treatment, presents a considerable risk to military effectiveness and lethality. The new policy will ensure that well-established mental and physical health standards, including the use of medical drugs, are applied equally to all individuals who want to join the military. The Secretary of Defense's memorandum and report on this policy have been made public.
