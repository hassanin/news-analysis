This article discusses the efforts of the President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (PITF) in combating human trafficking. The Obama Administration has focused on four priority areas: rule of law, victim services, procurement and supply chains, and public awareness and outreach. The article highlights some of the achievements in each of these areas. For example, the Justice Department has announced $22 million in grant funding to combat human trafficking, the FBI has taken part in over 120 Human Trafficking Task Forces resulting in arrests and safe recoveries, and the Department of State has launched a new registration program to enhance protections for domestic workers. Additionally, efforts have been made to combat trafficking in supply chains, raise public awareness, and provide training and resources to various sectors. The article also references the formation of the U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking and Presidential Proclamations on National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month.
