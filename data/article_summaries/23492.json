President Obama met with members of the Global Development Council at the White House to discuss promoting development as a key component of national security. The President urged the Council to develop actionable recommendations on catalyzing private sector investment in development, leveraging American innovation to reduce poverty and boost economic growth, and increasing agricultural production and food security without accelerating climate change. The meeting participants included U.S. Government Council Members, Council Members, and White House Participants. The Global Development Council is the first Presidential-level council devoted to global development policy and provides advice to the President and other senior U.S. officials on U.S. global development policy and practice.
