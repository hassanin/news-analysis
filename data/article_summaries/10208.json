President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring September 24, 2016, as National Public Lands Day in the United States. This day is celebrated by Americans across the country who volunteer to restore and enhance the public lands they enjoy. Activities include removing litter and invasive plant species, blazing new trails, maintaining existing ones, and planting seeds for future growth. The proclamation highlights the importance of public lands in preserving biodiversity and ecosystems, supporting the economy through tourism, and providing recreational and educational opportunities. The Obama Administration has protected millions of acres of public lands and promoted efforts to conserve outdoor spaces and reconnect Americans with nature. On National Public Lands Day, federally managed public lands and waters offer free admission to encourage people to appreciate and care for these spaces. Additionally, the "Every Kid in a Park" initiative provides fourth-grade students and their families with free access to National Parks and other Federal lands for a year. The proclamation emphasizes the need to address climate change to protect these natural resources and encourages Americans to engage in public service for the benefit of public lands.
