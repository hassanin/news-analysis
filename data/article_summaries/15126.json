The article discusses how the Affordable Care Act is benefiting middle class Americans by putting money back into their pockets. One provision of the law requires insurance companies to spend at least 80% of premium dollars on medical care and health care quality improvement, rather than on administrative costs. If they don't meet this requirement, they must provide a refund to their customers. In 2012, 8.5 million consumers received half a billion dollars in refunds, with the average refund being around $100 per family. Additionally, 77.8 million consumers saved $3.4 billion upfront on their premiums. The article also mentions that the Health Insurance Marketplaces, which will open in the fall, will offer new, affordable insurance options to Americans who currently don't have access to affordable options. The article provides data showing that premiums for some New Yorkers are expected to be up to 50% cheaper when the State's Health Insurance Marketplace opens. Overall, the article highlights the positive impact of the health care law on middle class Americans and the increased access to quality, affordable health care choices.
