The Executive Order titled "Wildland-Urban Interface Federal Risk Mitigation" was issued by President Barack Obama on May 18, 2016. The order aims to improve the resilience of the United States to wildfires by strengthening the security and resilience of buildings in the wildland-urban interface. The order directs federal agencies to enhance the resilience of their buildings in the event of a wildfire and comply with the International Wildland-Urban Interface Code (IWUIC) or an equivalent code. It also encourages agencies to conduct wildfire risk assessments and create defensible spaces for high-risk buildings. The order provides guidelines for agencies to ensure compliance and requires progress reports every two years. The order applies to buildings within the United States and its territories and does not create any enforceable rights or benefits.
