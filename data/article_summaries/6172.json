President Biden held a meeting to discuss strengthening competition in the meat industry. He highlighted the dominance of four big corporations in the market and the negative impact this has on farmers, ranchers, and consumers. He emphasized the need for more competition to lower prices and give farmers more options for selling their products. The administration announced a $1 billion investment in meat and poultry processing capacity, as well as efforts to strengthen rules to protect farmers and enforce competition laws. The Department of Justice and the Department of Agriculture also announced a joint initiative to make it easier for farmers and ranchers to report potential violations of competition laws. The meeting included remarks from farmers and industry leaders who shared their perspectives on the challenges they face and the potential benefits of increased competition.
