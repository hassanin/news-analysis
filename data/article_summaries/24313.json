President Obama has proposed a plan to help responsible homeowners and heal the housing market. The plan includes broad-based refinancing to help borrowers save an average of $3,000 per year, a homeowner bill of rights, a pilot sale to transition foreclosed properties into rental housing, a full year of forbearance for borrowers looking for work, a joint investigation into mortgage origination and servicing abuses, rehabilitating neighborhoods and reducing foreclosures, expanding eligibility for the Home Affordable Mortgage Program (HAMP), and increasing incentives for modifications that help borrowers rebuild equity. The plan aims to provide relief to homeowners, stabilize neighborhoods, and support the economy.
