Since his inauguration, President Trump has taken several actions to fulfill his promises to the American people. Within hours of taking office, he moved to protect Americans from Obamacare, government regulations, and future bailouts. He withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, implemented a hiring freeze, and prevented taxpayer money from funding abortions overseas. He also promoted job creation by jumpstarting the construction of two energy pipelines and reducing regulatory burdens on the manufacturing and construction industry. In addition, he followed through on his pledge to protect America's borders and enforce immigration laws. President Trump has also engaged in foreign relations, holding conversations with 11 foreign leaders to promote American interests. He has had four nominees confirmed by the Senate, held stakeholder meetings with business and labor leaders, and met with congressional leaders to discuss his agenda. He has also visited the headquarters of the CIA, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense. Furthermore, he hosted U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May and thanked American law enforcement and first responders. He proclaimed National School Choice Week and his team has been working to implement his agenda and ensure his team is in place at various departments and agencies.
