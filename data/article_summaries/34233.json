In this article, Rob Joyce, the White House Cybersecurity Coordinator, discusses the significant risk that cyber threats pose to America's national security and public safety. As our dependence on technology and digital storage continues to grow, criminal actors and adversarial nation states are exploiting existing flaws in software, hardware, and the actions of legitimate users to steal, disrupt, and destroy critical data and services. Joyce emphasizes the need for the government to defend against cyber threats and hold criminals accountable, while also promoting resilience in the digital systems architecture. This requires a balance between sustaining the means to pursue rogue cyber actors and sharing knowledge of vulnerabilities with responsible parties to strengthen digital infrastructure. Joyce explains that the Vulnerabilities Equities Process (VEP) is used to determine whether newly-discovered vulnerabilities should be disclosed to vendors for patching or temporarily restricted for national security or law enforcement purposes. He argues that conducting a risk/benefit analysis is a vital responsibility of the Federal Government. Joyce highlights the importance of transparency, fair representation of all stakeholders, and accountability in the VEP process. He states that the release of the VEP Charter and annual reports will provide metrics and inform the public about the process and its outcomes. Joyce concludes by stating that vulnerability management requires sophisticated engagement to protect people, critical infrastructure, and national security interests, and the newly endorsed VEP Charter helps strike a balance between these interests.
