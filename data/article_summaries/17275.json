The article discusses the background and preparations for the Pittsburgh Summit that took place on September 24-25, 2009. Pittsburgh, known for its transformation from a steel city to a center of high-tech innovation, was chosen as the host city for the summit. The White House aimed to make the summit environmentally friendly by using green technology and responsible materials. 65% of the materials used for the summit were environmentally friendly. The custom-designed Plenary Table used forest waste, organic dyes, and recycled fiber board. The summit also utilized LED lighting instruments and Class I amplifier technology to reduce electricity consumption. The summit started at Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, a LEED-certified building powered by a solid oxide fuel cell. The leaders then moved to the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, the first "green" convention center awarded LEED Gold Certification. The center focused on energy and environmental design, with features such as natural light, natural ventilation, and water reclamation systems. The center also incorporated sustainable site and materials, and sourced some produce from rooftop gardens and local farms.
