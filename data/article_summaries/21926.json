The White House Office of the Press Secretary held a press briefing with Press Secretary Jay Carney and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. Secretary LaHood discussed the impacts of sequestration on the American travel industry. He stated that if sequestration comes to pass, the Department of Transportation (DOT) would need to cut nearly a billion dollars, with over $600 million of these cuts coming from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). As a result, FAA employees would be furloughed for approximately one day per pay period, which could lead to delays of up to 90 minutes during peak hours in major airports. Additionally, over 100 air traffic control towers at airports with fewer than 150,000 flight operations per year would likely close, impacting services for commercial, general aviation, and military aircraft. Secretary LaHood urged Congress to address the issue and work on a long-term, balanced solution to the deficit challenges.
