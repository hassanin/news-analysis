Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced that every state and the District of Columbia met the deadline to commit 100 percent of their highway Recovery Act funds to specific projects. This allows contracts to be bid, workers to be hired, and construction projects to begin. Over 12,000 Recovery Act projects have been funded, with nearly 7,800 already underway. The total amount of funds put towards highway projects nationwide is $26.6 billion. These projects have improved over 33,000 miles of pavement across the United States. The funding has also allowed states to receive lower bids, saving taxpayer dollars and creating more jobs. The announcement was made at a construction site in Florida, where a $20 million project is expanding a road and employing over 50 workers. Several other major Recovery Act-funded projects were highlighted, including the I-4/Selmon Expressway in Tampa and the Nelsonville Bypass in Ohio.
