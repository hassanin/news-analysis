The Trustees of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds have released a report showing that the economic recovery, driven by the President's economic and vaccination plans, has strengthened these programs and improved the nation's fiscal position. The report states that the Social Security and Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Funds will be able to pay benefits for a longer period than previously projected. This is attributed to a faster recovery in employment, earnings, and economic growth. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office has projected a significant reduction in the deficit this year, thanks to the American Rescue Plan. However, the President criticizes Congressional Republicans' approach, led by Chair Rick Scott, which would put these programs at risk every five years. The President emphasizes the need for open and honest discussions to strengthen the economy, address inflation, improve the fiscal position, and support the programs relied upon by millions of Americans.
