On October 28, 2021, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. declared that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13067, which was expanded by Executive Order 13400, must continue beyond November 3, 2021. The national emergency was initially declared in 1997 due to the actions and policies of the Government of Sudan, and it was expanded in 2006 to address the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region. The President's declaration comes as Sudan faces a military takeover of the government and the arrest of civilian leaders, threatening the positive gains made in the country's transition toward democracy since 2019. The situation in Darfur continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The notice of this declaration will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
