President Trump delivered remarks in the Rose Garden of the White House, announcing the most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American people. The administration has already taken steps to get drug prices under control, such as reforming the Drug Discount Program and increasing competition. The plan aims to tackle the issue of special interests in the pharmaceutical industry, which spends more money on lobbying than any other industry. The plan includes reforms to end Obamacare's incentives for higher drug prices, give Medicare Part D plans tools to negotiate lower prices, and ban the Pharmacist Gag Rule. The plan also addresses unfair pricing overseas and vows to fix the injustice of Americans paying more for medication than other countries. The administration will work with Congress to pass legislation to save Americans even more money at the pharmacy.
