On February 27, 2018, President Donald Trump issued executive orders related to healthcare. The first order revokes Executive Order 13545 from June 22, 2010. The second order amends Executive Order 13265 from June 6, 2002, which establishes the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition. The amended order aims to promote the benefits of youth sports, fitness, and nutrition and expand youth sports participation. It also seeks to increase awareness of the importance of physical activity and good nutrition, develop strategies to improve participation in sports and physical activity, and establish a national and local strategy to recruit volunteers who will support youth participation. The order establishes the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition, composed of up to 30 members appointed by the President. The council will advise the President and the Secretary of Health and Human Services on progress and recommend actions to accelerate progress. Each executive department and agency will provide information and assistance to the council, and the council will be provided with necessary staff, supplies, facilities, and administrative services. The expenses of the council will be paid from funds available to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The order also includes provisions regarding the functions of the council, implementation, and limitations on its scope.
