Vice President Kamala Harris held a teleconference to address the issue of home and community-based care in the United States. Currently, over 7 million Americans rely on these services for their well-being and independence, but many others do not have access due to cost, limited spots in Medicaid programs, or a lack of care workers. Harris emphasized the importance of care work and the need for fair pay, safe working conditions, and respect for caregivers. Through the American Rescue Plan, President Biden and Harris have invested over $37 billion in home and community-based care in every state. This includes funding for education and training to address the care worker shortage, increased wages for care workers, and support for family caregivers. They are also calling on states to create comprehensive online registries of qualified care workers to make it easier for those in need of care to find suitable providers. Overall, the goal is to make the care system more accessible, affordable, and equitable for all Americans.
