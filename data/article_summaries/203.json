The article is a Presidential Determination memo issued by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. The memo identifies certain countries as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries for fiscal year 2024. The countries listed include Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela.

The memo clarifies that a country's inclusion on the list does not necessarily reflect its government's counterdrug efforts or cooperation with the United States. The designation is based on a combination of geographic, commercial, and economic factors that facilitate drug transit or production.

The memo also highlights the amendment made by the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023, which now includes source countries of precursor chemicals used in illicit drug production as major drug source countries. The memo urges countries like China to tighten their chemical supply chains to prevent diversion.

Furthermore, the memo designates Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably to adhere to international counternarcotics agreements and take required measures. However, it emphasizes that United States programs supporting these countries are vital to national interests.

The memo acknowledges the ongoing drug overdose crisis in the United States and the administration's efforts to address it. It highlights the allocation of significant resources towards prevention, treatment, and reducing the supply of illicit drugs. The memo emphasizes the need for international cooperation to combat the global synthetic drug threat and mentions the launch of a Global Coalition to Address Synthetic Drug Threats.

The memo underscores the importance of Mexico as a key partner in countering illicit drug threats and calls for continued collaboration in law enforcement, prevention of chemical diversion, and treatment of drug substance use disorders. It also mentions the United States' support for efforts in South America to reduce coca cultivation and cocaine production.

Finally, the memo mentions the removal of Afghanistan from the list of countries that have "failed demonstrably" due to progress made in reducing opium poppy cultivation and illicit narcotics production. However, it expresses concerns about the continuation of the illicit drug trade in Afghanistan and calls for sustained efforts to combat drug trafficking and production.

The memo concludes by directing the Secretary of State to submit the designation to Congress and publish it in the Federal Register.
