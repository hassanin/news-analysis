In February 2023, Vice President Harris is leading the implementation of the Root Causes Strategy, which aims to address the factors that drive irregular migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The strategy focuses on improving economic, governance, and security conditions in these countries to discourage people from leaving their homes. The efforts are providing hope and opportunity to the people of Central America, emphasizing that a secure and prosperous future can be found within their own communities.
