In a statement, President Obama criticized the November 7 elections in Burma, stating that they were neither free nor fair and did not meet international standards for legitimate elections. The President highlighted the regime's continued detention of over 2,100 political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, which denied them the opportunity to participate in the process. He also pointed out the unfair electoral laws and partisan Election Commission that silenced and sidelined the National League for Democracy, Burma's leading pro-democracy party. The regime further denied the registration of certain ethnic parties, cancelled elections in ethnic areas, and manipulated the campaign process to hinder pro-democracy and opposition candidates. President Obama emphasized that elections cannot be credible when the regime rejects dialogue with opponents and suppresses basic freedoms of expression, speech, and assembly. The United States will closely monitor the situation in Burma and continue to apply pressure and engagement based on conditions on the ground and the actions of the Burmese authorities. The President called for the immediate and unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi and all other political prisoners, an end to systematic human rights violations, accountability for human rights violators, and the initiation of a long-overdue dialogue with pro-democracy and ethnic minority groups. Only through genuine and inclusive dialogue can Burma achieve a representative democracy that respects human rights and improves the lives of its citizens.
