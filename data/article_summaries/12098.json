Vice President Biden has called for a report on green opportunities for the middle class at a meeting of the White House Task Force on the Middle Class. He wants the Council for Environmental Quality to propose ways to expand green opportunities and energy savings for the middle class within 90 days. This could include initiatives such as retrofitting commercial buildings, making homes more energy efficient, and developing tools to help people find green jobs. The Obama-Biden Administration has previously invested in making homes more energy efficient through the Recovery Act. They now aim to facilitate the growth of the energy efficiency sector using private funds and establish national training standards. The White House Council on Environmental Quality will coordinate agencies to identify and create proposals for expanding green opportunities and energy savings for the middle class. The "Recovery through Retrofit" Interagency Working Group, led by the Council, will ensure that the investments made under the Recovery Act are the beginning of a new market for energy retrofits in homes across America. Participating departments and agencies include Energy, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, General Services Administration, Education, and Treasury.
