On Transgender Day of Remembrance, the Biden-Harris Administration acknowledges the deadliest year on record for transgender Americans. They mourn the lives lost due to violence, discrimination, and harassment, particularly among transgender women and girls of color. At least 46 transgender Americans have been killed this year alone. To commemorate this day, the White House hosted a vigil where the Second Gentleman lit 46 candles representing the transgender individuals killed in the United States, along with an additional candle for those lost to violence worldwide. The White House also released a report from the Interagency Working Group on Safety, Opportunity, and Inclusion for Transgender and Gender Diverse Individuals, outlining over 45 key actions being taken to address the root causes of anti-transgender violence and discrimination. These actions build upon the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to advance LGBTQI+ equality and civil rights for transgender and gender diverse communities.
