On December 12, 2017, the President signed two bills into law. The first bill, H.R. 2810, is the "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018." This bill authorizes appropriations for the Department of Defense programs, military construction, and Department of Energy national security programs. It also authorizes recruitment and retention bonuses, special payments, and other authorities related to the U.S. Armed Forces. Additionally, it provides authorities and makes modifications to national security, foreign affairs, and other related programs.

The second bill, H.R. 4374, amends the statutory authority for the use of unapproved medical products during a military emergency. It aims to expedite the development and review of medical products for military emergency use, as well as improve cross-government coordination on the development and review of such medical products.
