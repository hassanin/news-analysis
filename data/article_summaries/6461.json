In this article, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. reports issuing an Executive Order to expand the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13219 of June 26, 2001. The expanded order includes the territory of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Albania, collectively known as the Western Balkans. The reason behind the expansion is the situation in the region over the past two decades, which includes the undermining of post-war agreements, widespread corruption, and obstruction of democratic and judicial processes. These factors are seen as threats to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The Executive Order broadens the sanctions regime and designates criteria for addressing these threats. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, will determine individuals whose property and interests will be blocked if they are found to have undermined democratic processes, engaged in corruption, human rights abuses, or violated regional security agreements. All government departments and agencies are directed to implement the provisions of the order.
