In this press briefing, Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton discusses the politics of the offshore drilling announcement made by the White House. He explains that the President's view is to take a comprehensive approach to energy policy and that the decision on offshore drilling was made based on what is best for the country, not what would appease political coalitions. He also mentions that there is some support for the decision from both sides of the aisle. Burton addresses concerns about angering environmentalists and explains that the President will continue to work with all parties to make progress on energy policy. He emphasizes the importance of decreasing dependence on foreign oil and creating jobs in the renewable energy sector. The briefing also touches on other topics such as climate change legislation, healthcare, jobs, and international issues like Iran and sanctions.
