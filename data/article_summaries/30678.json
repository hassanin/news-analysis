President Trump, President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto of Mexico, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada gathered in Buenos Aires to sign the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is set to replace NAFTA. The USMCA is hailed as the largest, most significant, modern, and balanced trade agreement in history. It includes provisions to support high-paying manufacturing jobs, promote greater access for American exports, expand agricultural exports, and protect intellectual property. The agreement also includes measures to ensure fair competition, promote high wages for autoworkers, and combat unfair trade practices. The USMCA is seen as a model agreement that benefits working people and will lead to greater growth and opportunity in North America.
