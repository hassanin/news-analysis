President Obama has declared a major disaster in Mississippi and authorized federal aid to help with recovery efforts after severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding hit the state between December 23-28, 2015. The declaration makes federal funding available for affected individuals in five counties. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for emergency work, facility repair or replacement, and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. Joe M. Girot has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and deemed necessary.
