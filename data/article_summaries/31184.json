The Presidential Memorandum issued on August 7, 2020, extends the use of the National Guard to respond to COVID-19 and facilitate economic recovery. The policy aims to foster cooperation between the federal government and states in combating the spread of COVID-19 and supporting economic activity. The memorandum directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to fund an additional 25% of emergency assistance activities in Arizona, bringing the federal cost share to 100%. This funding will be available until September 30, 2020, and covers duty necessary to comply with health protection protocols. The memorandum also includes general provisions regarding its implementation and does not create any enforceable rights or benefits.
