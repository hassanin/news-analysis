The White House has announced that they have secured commitments from various organizations to provide nearly 300,000 summer jobs and other employment opportunities for low-income and disconnected youth. This includes 90,000 paid jobs, as well as mentorships, internships, and training opportunities. They have also launched the Summer Jobs+ Bank, an online search tool to help connect young people to jobs and other employment opportunities. The President proposed $1.5 billion for summer jobs and year-round employment for low-income youth, but when Congress failed to act, the Federal government and private sector came together to create these opportunities. Three cities, Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco, have joined as Summer Jobs+ Cities and have committed to providing new jobs and internships for youth. The full list of commitments can be found on the Department of Labor's website.
