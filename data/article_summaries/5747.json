During a recent press briefing, officials provided updates on the fight against the Delta variant and the efforts to increase vaccination rates. They highlighted that the Delta variant is driving a rise in cases, particularly in communities with lower vaccination rates. States like Florida and Texas have seen a significant increase in COVID cases and hospitalizations. Vaccination is emphasized as the best defense against COVID and ending the pandemic.

The officials reported progress in vaccination efforts, with an average of half a million people getting newly vaccinated each day and 3.3 million Americans receiving their first shot in the past week. There has been a significant increase in vaccinations among 12- to 17-year-olds, and states with high case rates have seen an increase in vaccination rates as well.

The briefing also discussed the growing momentum of vaccination requirements. The federal government has implemented vaccination requirements for federal workers and contractors, and similar standards are being applied in other sectors. State and local governments, healthcare systems, businesses, universities, and other institutions are also implementing vaccination requirements. Over 700 colleges and universities have announced vaccination requirements, covering approximately 5 million students.

The officials highlighted the importance of vaccination requirements in ending the pandemic and keeping people and communities safe. They also discussed efforts to respond to outbreaks caused by the Delta variant, including deploying federal personnel and providing emergency medical care, testing sites, and therapeutics to affected states. The briefing concluded with a reminder for unvaccinated individuals to get vaccinated.

In the Q&A session, the officials addressed questions about the Delta variant's impact on children, long-haul symptoms in children, the shipment of donated Pfizer doses to other countries, vaccination verification methods, and the possibility of booster shots. They provided updates and insights on these topics, emphasizing the need for continued monitoring, adherence to guidelines, and the availability of resources to support vaccination efforts.
