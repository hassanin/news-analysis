The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) was signed into law on January 1, 1970, and requires Federal agencies to consider and inform the public of the environmental effects of proposed major Federal actions. On the 50th anniversary of NEPA, the Council on Environmental Quality reflects on its goals of protecting the nation's natural resources and commits to ensuring a safe, healthy, and productive environment for all Americans. NEPA's requirements affect daily activities such as commuting, turning on lights, and accessing clean drinking water. Many projects, including construction, energy projects, and public land management, must undergo Federal environmental review before proceeding. However, the environmental review process has become increasingly complex and difficult to navigate, causing uncertainty and delays. To address this, the administration has directed Federal agencies to implement a One Federal Decision policy for major infrastructure projects and has instructed the Council on Environmental Quality to update NEPA implementing regulations. The administration has also focused on cutting burdensome regulations and aims to improve the environmental review and permitting process while ensuring environmental protection for the benefit of the economy and future generations.
