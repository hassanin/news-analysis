The White House has announced that the first America's PrepareAthon! national day of action will take place on April 30, 2014. America's PrepareAthon! is a campaign aimed at increasing emergency preparedness and resilience through participation in hazard-specific drills, group discussions, and exercises. The goal is to get more Americans to understand the potential disasters in their communities and what to do to stay safe. The campaign focuses on tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, and wildfires. Participants can register at www.ready.gov/prepare, download guides, plan activities, and practice drills. The website also provides resources to help individuals and organizations prepare for disasters.
