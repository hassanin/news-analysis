The White House issued a statement expressing sympathy for the loss of 46 sailors on the Republic of Korea Navy ship Cheonan, which was sunk by a torpedo. The statement strongly condemns the act of aggression and states that the report by international investigators overwhelmingly points to North Korea as responsible for the attack. The attack is seen as a challenge to international peace and security and a violation of the Armistice Agreement. The United States fully supports South Korea in seeking justice for the victims and defending against further aggression. The statement emphasizes that North Korea's belligerence and defiance only lead to further isolation and strengthen the resolve of its neighbors to safeguard peace and stability in the region.
