President Barack Obama has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Syria will continue beyond May 11, 2010. The emergency was declared in 2004 and has been relied upon for additional steps taken in 2006 and 2008. While Syria has made progress in suppressing foreign fighter networks, its support for terrorist organizations and pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and missile programs continue to pose a threat to the United States' national security, foreign policy, and economy. The President has determined that it is necessary to maintain the national emergency and the sanctions in place to address this threat. The future renewal or termination of the emergency will depend on Syrian actions.
