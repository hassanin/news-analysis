The White House Press Secretary released a statement on the fifth anniversary of the Sudan Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), which ended Africa's longest-running war. The statement emphasizes the need for transparent and timely implementation of the agreement. President Obama has made promoting peace and stability in Sudan a priority, and the administration is committed to supporting the CPA. The statement acknowledges the progress made in Sudan, such as the withdrawal of northern military forces from southern Sudan, the sharing of oil wealth, and an agreement on the contested Abyei region. However, recent setbacks including violent clashes, repressive legislation, and failure to reach agreements on critical issues raise concerns. The United States will hold responsible those responsible for delays and deviations from the path to lasting peace. With only one year remaining in the CPA's transition period before the south votes on secession, the United States is intensifying efforts to mobilize international coordination and support for the CPA and prepare for the future.
