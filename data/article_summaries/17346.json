On June 15, 2010, the President signed S. 3473 into law, which amends the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. The law authorizes the Coast Guard to receive multiple advances, up to $100 million each, from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. The total amount of all advances cannot exceed the incident cap under current law, which is $1 billion. These funds will be used to support Federal response activities related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. This spill was caused by the explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon mobile offshore oil unit.
