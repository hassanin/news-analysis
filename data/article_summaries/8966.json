The President of the United States, in a meeting with public and private partners, highlighted the commitment to building better infrastructure and a better future. They have initiated sustainable infrastructure projects across Africa, Asia, and the Americas, focusing on climate security, health security, food security, and economic security. The United States has already mobilized over $30 billion in investments and plans to enhance their focus on investing in key economic corridors. One example is the U.S. Development Finance Corporation's interest in investing in a railway project in Sub-Saharan Africa that aims to connect the continent from east to west. This project would promote trade, create jobs, strengthen supply chains, incentivize investments in agriculture, and improve food security, clean energy, and digital connectivity. Similar work is being done in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Indonesia, and other places. The President emphasized the importance of strengthening infrastructure in low- and middle-income countries to deliver opportunities and prosperity. They called for maximizing investments and showing that democracies can deliver. The President thanked the partners for their leadership and partnership on this issue.
