First Lady Michelle Obama has launched a nationwide campaign called Let's Move to combat childhood obesity. The goal is to solve the challenge of childhood obesity within a generation so that children born today will reach adulthood at a healthy weight. The Let's Move campaign will engage every sector impacting the health of children and provide schools, families, and communities with tools to help kids be more active, eat better, and get healthy. To support Let's Move, the Partnership for a Healthier America has been created, which will accelerate existing efforts and facilitate new commitments towards the national goal. The campaign includes strategies such as empowering parents to make healthier choices, serving healthier food in schools, and increasing access to healthy, affordable food. It also focuses on increasing physical activity and engaging professional sports organizations to promote active play. The Let's Move campaign aims to address the various factors that contribute to childhood obesity and involves collaboration among government, medicine and science, business, education, athletics, community organizations, and more.
