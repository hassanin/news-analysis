On July 21, 2022, the President signed H.R. 8351, also known as the "Formula Act," into law. This legislation amends the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to temporarily suspend rates of duty on imports of specific infant formula products. The bill also includes provisions for other purposes. The President expressed gratitude to Senators Lee, Wyden, and Crapo, as well as Representatives Blumenauer, DelBene, Larson, Kildee, Neal, and Brady for their involvement in the legislation.
