Executive Order 13532, issued by President Barack Obama on February 26, 2010, aims to promote excellence, innovation, and sustainability in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the United States. The order recognizes the historic and ongoing contributions of HBCUs to the country and seeks to strengthen their capacity to provide high-quality education. It establishes the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities, which will work with various partners to increase the capacity of HBCUs, improve information dissemination about these institutions, share best practices within the HBCU community, and explore new ways to improve the relationship between the Federal Government and HBCUs. The order also establishes the President's Board of Advisors on Historically Black Colleges and Universities, which will advise the President and the Secretary of Education on matters related to strengthening the educational capacity of HBCUs. The order revokes a previous executive order related to HBCUs.
