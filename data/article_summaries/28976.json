The Senate has passed an amendment to H.R. 6, the Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018, which is a bipartisan legislation aimed at combating the opioid crisis. The bill includes provisions to reduce the amount of illicit fentanyl entering the United States, improve treatment for infants suffering from neonatal abstinence syndrome, create job training programs for those in recovery, and reauthorize the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The President and his Administration are working on implementing effective policies to address the opioid crisis and save lives. They look forward to working with both chambers to get the bill to the President's desk.
