On September 12, 2018, President Donald Trump issued an executive order declaring a national emergency in response to the threat of foreign interference in United States elections. The order states that the ability of foreign entities to interfere in or undermine public confidence in U.S. elections poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to national security and foreign policy. The order directs the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with other executive departments and agencies, to conduct an assessment of any foreign interference in U.S. elections and report the findings to the President and other government officials. The Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security are also required to deliver a report evaluating the impact of foreign interference on election infrastructure and political organizations. The order authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with other officials, to impose sanctions on foreign persons who have engaged in or supported foreign interference in U.S. elections. It also prohibits the making of any contributions or provision of funds, goods, or services to or from such persons. The order further suspends entry into the United States of individuals whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the order. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, is authorized to take necessary actions to implement the order, including the promulgation of rules and regulations. The order also requires the Secretary of the Treasury to submit reports on the national emergency declared in the order to Congress.
