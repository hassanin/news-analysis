The White House has released a statement on the opening of the Embassy of the United States of America in Havana, Cuba, and the opening of the Cuban Embassy in Washington, D.C. The statement emphasizes that these openings are the result of respectful dialogue between the United States and Cuba, following the announcements made by President Obama and President Raul Castro in December 2014 to reestablish diplomatic relations. The statement expresses the hope for collaboration and normalization of relations with the Cuban government and people after more than half a century of discord. It highlights the ability for American diplomats to engage more broadly across the island of Cuba and collaborate with the Cuban government on issues of common interest. The statement also emphasizes the belief that engagement with the Cuban people is the best way to advance universal values like freedom of speech and assembly. The State Department delegation, led by Assistant Secretary of State Roberta Jacobson, and representatives from the White House, including Deputy National Security Advisor Benjamin J. Rhodes and National Security Council Senior Director Mark Feierstein, are attending the opening ceremonies.
