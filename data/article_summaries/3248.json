The Biden-Harris Administration has announced that public tours of the White House will resume on July 19, 2022. The tours will be available from Tuesdays to Saturdays, from 8:00 AM to 12:30 PM, excluding Federal holidays. The tours are free of charge but must be requested through a Member of Congress and their Congressional Tour Coordinator. Requests should be submitted at least 21 days in advance and no more than 90 days in advance. The White House will monitor the COVID-19 situation and may adjust tour availability based on health guidance. Visitors who have tested positive for COVID-19, experienced symptoms, or been in close contact with a confirmed or suspected case within 10 days prior to the tour should stay home. Face masks will be available for those who choose to wear them.
