Vice President Kamala Harris convened Attorneys General from seven states and the District of Columbia to discuss efforts to disrupt the illicit fentanyl supply chain and expand access to care for individuals at risk of an overdose. The discussion, moderated by White House Office of National Drug Control Policy Director Dr. Rahul Gupta and joined by White House Director of Intergovernmental Affairs Tom Perez, focused on the actions taken by the Biden-Harris Administration to address the opioid and overdose epidemic. These actions include releasing a National Response Plan to address the threat of fentanyl combined with xylazine, as well as announcing nearly $50 million in grants to address the nation's overdose epidemic. The Vice President expressed gratitude for the state Attorneys General's partnership in expanding substance use prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery services. The officials discussed various tools developed and supported by the Administration that states can utilize to save lives, such as the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program, the xylazine National Response Plan, and state model laws addressing substance use disorder and overdoses. They also discussed expanding treatment for substance use disorder for incarcerated individuals. The Vice President and the state Attorneys General identified opportunities to enhance federal and state collaboration to combat the fentanyl and opioid epidemic, including coordinating with regional HIDTA Programs and utilizing federal, state, and opioid settlement funds for evidence-based programs.
