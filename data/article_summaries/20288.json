This article discusses an executive order issued by President Barack Obama titled "Comprehensive Approach to Atrocity Prevention and Response." The order establishes an interagency Atrocities Prevention Board (Board) with the purpose of coordinating a whole-of-government approach to prevent mass atrocities and genocide. The Board will monitor and analyze mass atrocity threats, identify gaps in current policies, and make recommendations to strengthen prevention and response efforts. The order also outlines the structure and protocols of the Board, including its composition and reporting requirements. Additionally, the order highlights the responsibilities of various agencies in enhancing capabilities and tools for preventing and responding to mass atrocities. The Department of State and USAID will offer training courses, build civilian capacity, and develop partnerships with other organizations. The intelligence community will monitor global risks and share intelligence with the US government. The Department of Defense will develop joint doctrine and training, and the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice will propose amendments to immigration and other laws to deny impunity to perpetrators of mass atrocities. The order emphasizes coordination with bilateral and multilateral partners and the enhancement of early warning, analysis, prevention, response, and accountability efforts. The order concludes with general provisions, including the voluntary service of Board members and the non-impairment of existing authorities and functions.
