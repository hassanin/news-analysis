First Lady Michelle Obama will be joining Shaquille O'Neal, Allyson Felix, and Dominique Dawes at a back-to-school event at Orr Elementary in Washington, DC. The event will highlight the healthy changes happening in schools and across the country. Mrs. Obama will announce new commitments to Let's Move! Active Schools, a program that aims to incorporate physical activity into schools before, during, and after the school day. Over 3,700 schools have already signed up for the program. Shaq and Allyson Felix, spokespeople for Reebok and Nike respectively, have made commitments to Let's Move! Active Schools. Orr Elementary School is an example of a school that has successfully implemented healthy lunch standards and provides healthier snacks in vending machines. The school also has physical education classes and participates in the BOKS initiative, which incorporates physical activity and nutrition into programming for kids before the school day. During the event, the First Lady will deliver remarks about healthy changes in schools and participate in a physical activity with children and the athletes.
