The Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough, National Economic Advisor Lael Brainard, and Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden held the first meeting of the Veteran Scam and Fraud Evasion (VSAFE) Task Force. The task force aims to implement a "no wrong door" approach for veterans and service members to access resources and reporting tools to combat fraud. Fraud against veterans and service members is a widespread issue, with thousands of fraud reports received by the Federal Trade Commission. Veterans face higher risks for fraud, with higher median losses compared to other civilians. In November, President Biden launched the VSAFE campaign and task force to address fraud and scams targeting veterans and their families. The task force will release a fraud prevention tool kit and create a one-stop shop for resources and reporting tools. During the meeting, agency leaders discussed their current actions against fraud and outlined next steps for implementing the "no wrong door" approach. They agreed to collaboratively draft call scripts, training, and procedures for call center staff to improve the veteran experience. An interagency working group will evaluate options to implement the approach and report back by the end of the first quarter of 2024. These actions build on the Biden-Harris Administration's efforts to support veterans, such as expanding benefits and services, awarding grants for suicide prevention programs, and providing funding for housing and support services for homeless veterans.
