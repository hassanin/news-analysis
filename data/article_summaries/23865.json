This article announces the establishment of an emergency board to investigate disputes between New Jersey Transit Rail and certain labor organizations representing its employees. The disputes have not been resolved under the Railway Labor Act, so a party has requested the President to appoint an emergency board. The board, consisting of three members, will investigate and report on the disputes within 30 days. During this period, no changes can be made to the conditions that led to the disputes, unless agreed upon by the parties. The records of the board will be maintained by the National Mediation Board, and the board will terminate upon submission of its report.
