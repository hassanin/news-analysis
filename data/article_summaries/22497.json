In a statement posted on the White House website, Christina Romer, the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, discusses the employment situation in November. She highlights that payroll employment declined by 11,000, a significant improvement from previous years. The employment loss in September and October was also revised down, indicating a higher employment level than previously reported. The largest employment gains were seen in temporary help services, indicating potential labor demand. Additionally, 21,000 jobs were added in state and local public education. The unemployment rate decreased from 10.2% in October to 10.0% in November, primarily due to an increase in the number of employed individuals. However, Romer emphasizes that despite this improvement, the unemployment rate is still unacceptably high. She concludes by stating that while there may be challenges ahead, the overall trend is moving in the right direction.
