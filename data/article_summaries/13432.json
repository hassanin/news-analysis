Vice President Biden concluded his "Road to Recovery" tour with Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood in Kalamazoo, Michigan. They attended the groundbreaking ceremony for the I-94 widening and Westnedge Avenue interchange reconstruction project. This project is part of the 2000th transportation construction project funded under the Recovery Act. The project, costing $43.9 million, aims to relieve congestion along Michigan's main commercial trucking corridors. The Treasury Department also announced the availability of $2 billion in Recovery Zone Bonds, with a portion going to the state of Michigan. These bonds help attract new jobs and private investment to areas most affected by the recession. The Vice President emphasized that these investments are not just about infrastructure, but about rebuilding the economy. Secretary LaHood noted that the Recovery Act has led to the hiring of construction workers and the start of infrastructure repairs that had been delayed for years. Governor Granholm and Senators Levin and Stabenow also highlighted the positive impact of Recovery Act projects on Michigan's economy and job creation. Since its enactment in February 2009, over $135 billion in Recovery Act funds have been obligated to programs and projects.
