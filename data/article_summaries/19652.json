The White House has issued a notice stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran, which was declared on November 14, 1979, will continue to be in effect. This decision is based on the fact that relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal and the process of implementing agreements with Iran is still ongoing. The national emergency will be extended for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
