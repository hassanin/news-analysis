Second Lady Karen Pence visited the Richard L. Roudebush Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center in Indianapolis to discuss the facility's new Creative Forces Program, which focuses on art therapy and telehealth. The roundtable discussion included art therapist Lisa Rainey, colleagues from the VA facility, and two veteran art therapy patients participating virtually. The veterans shared their experiences using art therapy for healing and recovery. Lisa explained the Creative Forces art therapy program, which started in 2019 through a partnership with the VA's Rural Veterans TeleRehabilitation Initiative, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on therapy sessions. Recreational Therapist Brittany Thomas discussed plans to expand the program by adding a music therapist in August and the challenges posed by COVID-19 requirements, such as increasing telehealth sessions and limiting the number of patients and visitors in the facility. The Creative Forces Program is an initiative of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) in partnership with the U.S. Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, serving military patients and veterans with traumatic brain injury and psychological health conditions.
