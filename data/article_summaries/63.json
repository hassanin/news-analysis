President Biden has signed a National Security Memorandum (NSM) to counter Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) terrorism and advance nuclear and radioactive material security worldwide. The strategy aims to protect the nation and the international community from the threats posed by WMD terrorism and prevent non-state actors from using chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons. The NSM integrates U.S. policies to counter WMD use by non-state actors, sets unified priorities for federal departments and agencies, and emphasizes collaboration with partners to prevent and respond to WMD terrorism threats. It also establishes comprehensive policies for securing radioactive materials and managing nuclear material security. The NSM addresses both existing weapons usable materials and emerging technologies that could be used in WMD development. The strategy outlines goals in three areas: countering WMD terrorism, advancing nuclear material security, and advancing radioactive material security. The policies aim to involve a broad range of partners and mitigate the risks associated with nuclear and radioactive materials globally.
