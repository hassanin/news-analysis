President Obama will be visiting Intel Corporation in Hillsboro, Oregon, where he will tour their semiconductor manufacturing facility and learn about their STEM education programs. The President believes that in order to succeed in the future, we must invest in education to grow the economy and create jobs. Intel has committed to investing over $6 billion in their U.S. manufacturing facilities, creating thousands of jobs. The President is calling on Congress to reform education by replacing No Child Left Behind, preparing more STEM teachers, and strengthening programs like the Pell Grant and American Opportunity Tax Credit. Intel has also invested over $1 billion in education and is part of the Change the Equation initiative to improve science and math education.
