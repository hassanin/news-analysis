On November 20, 2016, President Barack Obama and the Leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum adopted a set of initiatives at the 24th annual APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting. The theme of the meeting was Quality Growth and Human Development, and the goal was to ensure that the benefits of the global economy are shared by more people. APEC economies account for a significant portion of the world's population, GDP, and trade. The United States worked with other APEC Leaders and Ministers to raise standards for trade and bring benefits to more people. The initiatives covered a wide range of areas, including trade and investment, shared prosperity and inclusive growth, and providing cleaner and more resilient communities for citizens. Some specific initiatives included committing to reduce barriers to digital trade, supporting women's economic empowerment, simplifying business registration and widening access to credit, addressing food security and climate change, and strengthening food safety systems.
