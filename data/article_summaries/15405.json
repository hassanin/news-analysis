This article is a notice from the White House regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Zimbabwe. The national emergency was initially declared in 2003 by President Bush and involved blocking the property of certain individuals who were undermining Zimbabwe's democratic processes. Additional steps were taken in 2005 and 2008 to expand the scope of the national emergency. The notice states that the actions and policies of these individuals continue to pose a threat to the foreign policy of the United States, so the national emergency must continue beyond March 6, 2017. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
