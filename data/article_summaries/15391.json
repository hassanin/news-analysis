President Obama has announced a proposal to extend overtime pay to nearly 5 million workers. The proposal would guarantee overtime pay to most salaried workers earning less than $50,440 next year. Currently, the salary threshold is $23,660, which is below the poverty threshold for a family of four. The proposal aims to update regulations relating to overtime pay and simplify the rules for workers and businesses. It also includes provisions to prevent future erosion of overtime and ensure greater predictability by automatically updating the salary threshold based on inflation or wage growth. The proposal does not include changes to the "duties test" that determines whether salaried workers earning more than the threshold are exempt from overtime rules. The Department of Labor will be accepting comments on the proposal before finalizing the rule next year. This proposal is part of President Obama's efforts to support America's workers and grow the middle class, which includes raising the minimum wage, tax cuts for the middle class, college affordability, equal pay, workplace flexibility, promoting fair pay and safe workplaces, affordable health insurance, and security in retirement.
