The President has established a new initiative called "Made in Rural America" to help rural businesses and leaders take advantage of new investment opportunities and access new customers and markets abroad. The initiative will bring together federal resources and agencies such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the Small Business Administration to connect rural businesses to export information and assistance. Some specific commitments of the initiative include hosting regional forums to provide training and information on exporting, convening a conference to connect investors with rural business leaders, training local USDA Rural Development staff on export opportunities, providing enhanced export counseling, promoting rural-produced goods and services at trade events, educating local leaders on the importance of rural exports, and using the BusinessUSA online platform to connect rural businesses with export and investment resources.
