The Biden-Harris Administration is advancing the Gateway Hudson River Tunnel project to the next phase in the Federal Transit Administration's Capital Investment Grants program. This move unlocks up to $6.88 billion in funding for the project. The project involves constructing a new tunnel between New York and New Jersey and rehabilitating the existing 110-year-old rail tunnel. The Engineering phase will allow early actions such as utility relocations, real estate acquisitions, and further design. If all requirements are met, the Administration may award a Full Funding Grant Agreement for up to $6.88 billion, the largest commitment under the program to date. The funding comes from President Biden's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which aims to rebuild the nation's infrastructure and create jobs. The project is also eligible for other federal grant and loan programs. The Gateway Hudson River Tunnel project is a $17.18 billion investment that will improve train service between New York and New Jersey, reduce commute times, and create jobs. The existing tunnel is over 100 years old and has reached its capacity, causing delays. The project will rehabilitate the old tunnel, build a new one, and make other improvements. It is part of the larger Gateway Program, which aims to expand and rebuild the rail line between Newark and New York City. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also includes significant funding for rail and public transit projects along the Northeast Corridor.
