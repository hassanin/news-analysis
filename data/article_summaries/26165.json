President Donald J. Trump has canceled the Obama Administration's policy that prohibited the use of anti-personnel landmines by U.S. military forces outside of the Korean Peninsula. The Department of Defense believes that the previous policy placed American forces at a severe disadvantage against adversaries in conflict situations. A new landmine policy is being issued, allowing Combatant Commanders to use advanced, non-persistent landmines in exceptional circumstances. These landmines are designed to minimize harm to civilians and partner forces. The Trump Administration aims to give the military the flexibility and capability needed to win, with a focus on rebuilding and strengthening the armed forces. The President remains committed to supporting and equipping troops to maintain their status as the world's greatest fighting force.
