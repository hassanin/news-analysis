President Biden is launching programs to develop new and upgraded transmission lines in the United States. These initiatives aim to reduce electricity costs, prevent power outages during extreme weather events, and create jobs in the clean energy sector. The Department of Energy has opened applications for competitive grants worth $10.5 billion under the Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership Programs, as well as the $2.5 billion Transmission Facilitation Program. These programs represent the largest single federal investment in critical transmission infrastructure. Currently, 70% of the nation's transmission lines are over 25 years old, posing risks to communities, infrastructure, and the economy. Upgrading and expanding the transmission system will help deliver renewable energy to various regions and support the administration's goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving 100% clean electricity by 2035.
