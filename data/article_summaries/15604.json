In this article, President Barack Obama proclaims September as National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. He highlights the bravery of children facing cancer and the impact it has on their families and communities. While survival rates have improved, cancer remains the leading cause of death for young Americans. The causes of childhood cancer are largely unknown, so the government continues to invest in research and treatment. The Affordable Care Act provides important protections for individuals with cancer, such as coverage for clinical trials and prevention services. The President acknowledges the efforts of healthcare professionals, researchers, philanthropies, and advocacy groups in finding cures for childhood cancer. He calls on all Americans to join him in the fight against childhood cancer.
