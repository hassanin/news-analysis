President Obama issued a statement on the implementation of the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act. The act aims to stop deceptive credit card practices and hold credit card companies accountable to their customers. The final reform provisions of the act took effect, providing protection to consumers against unreasonable fees and penalties for late payments, unfair practices involving gift cards, and hidden over-the-limit fees. The act also restricts retroactive rate increases and prevents companies from increasing rates within the first year of opening an account. President Obama also mentioned the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which establishes a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to ensure the implementation of credit card reforms and hold big banks and lenders responsible. These reforms and the consumer watchdog aim to protect consumers and strengthen the economy by leveling the playing field for responsible lenders and empowering families and small business owners to make better financial decisions.
