First Lady Michelle Obama will be representing the United States in Copenhagen to support Chicago's bid for the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. President Obama is unable to attend due to his commitment to pass health insurance reform. Mrs. Obama, who was born and raised in Chicago, believes that the city would be a fantastic setting for the games. Chicago's diverse communities, vibrant neighborhoods, and commitment to the environment make it an ideal host. The President and First Lady will also be hosting an event at the White House to promote Chicago's bid and highlight their commitment to healthy living and youth sport.
