The U.S.-Africa Business Summit, hosted by the Corporate Council on Africa and the Government of Botswana, announced that the Biden-Harris Administration has helped close 75 new deals between the United States and African countries since the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit in December 2022. These deals have an estimated value of $5.7 billion in two-way trade and investment. Overall, since 2021, the U.S. Government has helped close over 900 deals across 47 African countries, totaling an estimated value of $22 billion in two-way trade and investment. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), the Administration's infrastructure initiative, is supporting and expanding these investments across the continent. Additionally, progress has been made in delivering on the $15 billion in commitments made at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, as well as the $8 billion in private sector commitments and $1 billion in U.S. Government commitments made during Vice President Kamala Harris's visit to Ghana, Tanzania, and Zambia in March 2023. These partnerships focus on areas such as sustainable energy, health systems, food security/agribusiness, digital connectivity, infrastructure, and finance. Businesses and investors have made progress on their commitments, and a full progress report can be accessed on the Prosper Africa website.
