National Security Advisor to the Vice President, Dr. Philip Gordon, along with a delegation of high-level U.S. officials, including USAID Deputy Administrator Isobel Coleman, will be visiting Guatemala and El Salvador on November 27-28. The purpose of the visit is to meet with government officials, private sector leaders, and civil society members to discuss bilateral cooperation and emphasize the importance of strengthening democracy, rule of law, and good governance in order to promote prosperity in the region.

During their visit, Dr. Gordon and the delegation will focus on implementing the Biden-Harris Administration's Root Causes Strategy, which aims to address the underlying reasons for migration from northern Central America. This includes improving civilian security, good governance, human rights, labor protections, countering gender-based violence, and expanding economic opportunity.

The delegation will also work on advancing Central America Forward, a public-private partnership that has generated over $4.2 billion in private sector investments under the leadership of the Vice President. They will meet with existing and potential private sector partners to mobilize further support, assess the impact of existing investments, and explore ways to create economic opportunities and jobs in the region.

Additionally, the delegation will highlight U.S. assistance to northern Central America in line with the Root Causes Strategy and lawful labor pathways. In FY 2022, the United States provided over $1 billion, including nearly $800 million in economic, development, and security assistance. These funds are part of the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to work with Congress to provide $4 billion over four years to address the root causes of migration and help improve the safety and stability of communities in the region.
