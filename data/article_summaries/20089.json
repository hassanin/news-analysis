The United States welcomes the decision by Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners to conclude Operation Decisive Storm in Yemen. They urge all parties, especially the Houthis and their supporters, to return to negotiations for a political dialogue. The United Nations will play a vital role in facilitating these talks. The US supports Saudi Arabia's commitment to providing humanitarian relief to Yemen and facilitating aid for those affected by the fighting. They also reiterate the obligation of all nations to abide by UN Security Council Resolution 2216, which prohibits the supply of arms to certain individuals. The US will continue to monitor terrorist threats posed by al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula and take necessary action to protect the United States and its citizens.
