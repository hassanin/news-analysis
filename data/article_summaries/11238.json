President Obama called President Calderón of Mexico to express his shock and sadness over the death of the Mexican Interior Minister Francisco Blake Mora and seven other Mexican government colleagues in a helicopter crash. The President offered his condolences to the families of those who were lost and expressed his commitment to the close partnership between the United States and Mexico during this difficult time. It is unclear whether President Calderón will be canceling any scheduled events. The White House may release a formal statement on the matter.
