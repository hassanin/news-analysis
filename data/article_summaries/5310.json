In this article, President Biden discusses his concerns about a leaked draft of a Supreme Court decision regarding abortion rights. He expresses his hope that there won't be enough votes for the draft to become law. He discusses the significance of the decision, stating that it not only affects a woman's right to choose, but also raises questions about other fundamental rights such as the right to privacy, the right to marry, and the right to make decisions about contraception and child-rearing. He emphasizes his belief in the existence of a right to privacy and the importance of upholding previous Supreme Court decisions such as Griswold v. Connecticut and Roe v. Wade. President Biden also mentions the potential impact of the decision on same-sex marriage laws in states like Florida. When asked about the potential codification of Roe v. Wade, he states that he thinks it makes sense. He acknowledges that he hasn't thought about the implications of the decision for the upcoming midterm elections or whether changes need to be made to the Court in response.
