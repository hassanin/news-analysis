President Donald Trump is implementing steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and the European Union due to concerns about United States national security. The tariffs follow an announcement in March of a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports. While the United States has reached agreements on steel with countries like South Korea, Australia, Argentina, and Brazil, satisfactory arrangements were not reached with Canada, Mexico, or the European Union. The excessive imports of steel and aluminum into the United States are seen as a threat to national security, as they are driven by a worldwide glut from overproduction by other countries. The Department of Commerce conducted investigations and found that the excessive level of imports could impair national security by causing further closures of domestic production capacity. President Trump accepted the Department of Commerce's recommendations and began to take action to address the threatened impairment.
