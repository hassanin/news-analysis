The article discusses an executive order issued by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. regarding travel restrictions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The order suspends and limits the entry of noncitizens into the United States who have been physically present in certain countries, including the Schengen Area, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Brazil, and South Africa, within the 14 days prior to their attempted entry. However, there are exceptions for certain individuals, such as U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and immediate family members of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will review and recommend whether to continue, modify, or terminate the proclamation based on the circumstances. The order also amends previous proclamations related to travel restrictions and includes provisions for implementation and enforcement.
