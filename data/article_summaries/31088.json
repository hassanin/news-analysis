On May 11, 2004, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 13338, declaring a national emergency with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria. This allowed for the blocking of property and the prohibition of certain goods to Syria. The national emergency was modified and further steps were taken in subsequent executive orders to deal with the threat posed by Syria's support of terrorism, occupation of Lebanon, pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, and obstruction of stabilization and reconstruction efforts in Iraq. The brutality and repression of the Syrian regime not only endangers the Syrian people but also generates instability in the region. The national emergency declared in 2004 and the measures adopted in subsequent executive orders are to continue beyond May 11, 2018. The United States condemns the Assad regime's use of violence and human rights abuses and calls for a political transition in Syria that promotes freedom, democracy, and justice. The United States will consider changes in the composition and actions of the Syrian government when deciding whether to continue or terminate the national emergency in the future.
