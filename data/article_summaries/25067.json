On January 19, 2018, Vice President Mike Pence delivered remarks at the 45th annual March for Life in the Rose Garden. He welcomed the attendees and emphasized the importance of the pro-life movement in the United States. Pence highlighted the Declaration of Independence's affirmation of the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. He acknowledged that the Supreme Court's decision 45 years ago turned its back on the right to life, but it sparked a movement that has continued to gain support. Pence praised President Donald Trump for his pro-life actions, such as preventing taxpayer dollars from funding abortion overseas and nominating judges who uphold constitutional liberties. He encouraged the marchers to persist in their activism and assured them that they have the support of the President and God. Pence concluded by introducing President Trump, who would address the crowd.
