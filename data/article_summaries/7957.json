President Biden has announced that the White House will host a Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health in September. The goal of the conference is to accelerate progress in ending hunger, improving nutrition and physical activity, reducing diet-related diseases, and addressing disparities. The Biden-Harris Administration aims to end hunger and increase healthy eating and physical activity in the US by 2030. The conference will bring together various stakeholders including anti-hunger and nutrition advocates, food companies, healthcare professionals, government entities, and individuals with lived experiences. It will also launch a national plan to achieve these goals. The administration will host listening sessions to gather input from across the country.
