Vice President Joe Biden spoke with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko about ongoing U.S. security assistance for Ukraine, Ukraine's anti-corruption efforts, energy security, and seeking justice for the Malaysia Airlines MH-17 tragedy. Biden welcomed recent reform laws passed by the Rada and stressed the importance of keeping up with Ukraine's reform agenda, particularly in combatting corruption. They also discussed the implementation of the Minsk agreements, with Poroshenko proposing a 30-kilometer zone free of tanks, artillery, and mortar systems along the line of contact in eastern Ukraine to be monitored by the OSCE. Both leaders acknowledged that Russia and Russia-backed separatists had not fully implemented the ceasefire and removal of heavy weapons as called for in the Minsk Implementation Plan.
