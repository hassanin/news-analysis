The United States is calling on China to remember and honor the hundreds of thousands of Chinese citizens who peacefully protested 31 years ago for a greater say in their country's governance and against corruption. The Chinese Communist Party's violent response to these protests, known as the Tiananmen Square massacre, is being condemned, and the US is urging China to provide a full accounting of those who were killed, detained, or remain missing. On this day of remembrance, the US is also calling on China to uphold the rights and freedoms guaranteed to its citizens, as outlined in international declarations and agreements, and to end the persecution of ethnic and religious minorities. The American people stand in solidarity with the Chinese citizens in their pursuit of fundamental rights, including accountable governance and freedom of speech, assembly, and religious belief.
