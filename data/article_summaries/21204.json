President Obama has signed into law H.R. 1473, which is the "Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011". However, he expressed his objection to certain sections of the Act. Section 1112 of the Act prevents the use of funds to transfer Guantanamo detainees into the United States, which the President believes undermines the executive branch's authority to determine how and where to prosecute these detainees. He believes that prosecuting terrorists in Federal court is an important tool for national security. Section 1113 of the Act restricts the transfer of detainees to foreign countries, interfering with the executive branch's ability to make foreign policy and national security determinations. The President argues that these restrictions hinder negotiations with foreign countries and efforts to conclude detainee transfers. Despite his objections, President Obama signed the Act to avoid a lapse in government appropriations. However, he intends to work with Congress to seek repeal of these restrictions and opposes any attempt to extend or expand them in the future. Additionally, Section 2262 of the Act prohibits the use of funds for certain positions that provide advice directly to the President. The President argues that this violates the separation of powers and his ability to carry out his constitutional responsibilities. Therefore, the executive branch will interpret this section in a way that does not infringe on the President's prerogatives.
