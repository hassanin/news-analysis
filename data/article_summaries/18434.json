The White House is hosting a three-day summit on Countering Violent Extremism (CVE). The summit aims to address the issue of violent extremism, which the administration sees as an important element of counterterrorism and national security. The summit will bring together representatives from various sectors including government officials, community leaders, religious authorities, and private sector partners. The first day of the summit will focus on domestic CVE programs, with representatives from pilot programs in Boston, the Twin Cities, and the Greater Los Angeles Metro Area sharing best practices and ideas. The second day will broaden the discussion to include voices from the private sector, cities around the world, and NGOs. The third day will take place at the State Department and will include government and civil society actors from around the world, with a focus on strengthening communities, countering extremist narratives, and promoting social, economic, and political inclusion. The summit is part of a broader strategy to prevent and counter violent extremism, and the administration hopes to build a global coalition to address this issue. While the summit does not specifically focus on ISIS or other specific terrorist groups, it is part of the broader effort to counter their influence. The administration will be rolling out a number of deliverables over the course of the three days, including a communique outlining commitments and goals for future work. The summit is seen as a catalyst for ongoing efforts to prevent and counter violent extremism.
