First Lady Michelle Obama has announced that President Obama has directed the National Security Staff to lead a 90-day review to develop a coordinated approach to supporting and engaging military families. The review will involve nearly twenty federal agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Veterans Affairs. It will set strategic military family priorities for the next ten years, review public and private programs, develop options for integrating military family matters into department priorities, examine opportunities for federal policies to support state and local efforts, identify opportunities for military family members to contribute to national and community life, and strengthen feedback mechanisms for military families. The goal is to ensure that the military can recruit and retain high-quality volunteers, service members can maintain strong family lives, civilian family members can fulfill their potential, and the general population better understands and supports military families. The announcement was made during an address to the National Military Family Association's summit, where the First Lady outlined a vision of long-term support for military families and emphasized the need for society to work together to make that vision a reality.
