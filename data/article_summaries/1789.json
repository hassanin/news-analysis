The Vice President recently met with Daniella, along with other business leaders, to discuss the impact of the Build Back Better agenda and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal. One key aspect of the discussion was the importance of a reliable transit system for businesses to thrive and for customers to access their products. The conversation also touched on the need for improved access to capital for minority- and women-owned businesses, which is part of the Build Back Better agenda. Additionally, affordable childcare was highlighted as crucial for small businesses, as many women have left the workforce due to a lack of such options. The Vice President commended Daniella's work at Colada and emphasized that these legislative efforts are essential for the growth and well-being of communities and the economy as a whole.
