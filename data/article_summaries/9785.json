In this letter, President Barack Obama reports to Congress about the ongoing military operations in Iraq. He states that the U.S. Armed Forces have conducted targeted airstrikes to address the threat posed by the terrorist group ISIL. These airstrikes have been carried out to stop the advance on Erbil, support civilians trapped on Mount Sinjar, recapture the Mosul Dam, and deliver humanitarian assistance to civilians in Amirli. President Obama emphasizes that these military operations are limited in scope and duration and are necessary to prevent endangerment of U.S. personnel, facilities, and Iraqi civilians. He asserts that these actions are being undertaken in coordination with and at the request of the Iraqi government. The President concludes by expressing his appreciation for the support of Congress in this action.
