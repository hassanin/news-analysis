In a statement by the Secretary of Labor regarding the Monthly Employment Situation Report, it was revealed that the US economy lost 651,000 jobs in February, resulting in an unemployment rate of 8.1 percent. This brings the total number of jobs lost since the recession began to 4.4 million, with almost 3 million Americans now unemployed for six months or more. The Secretary emphasized that these statistics represent the struggles of millions of Americans who are uncertain about supporting their families and paying bills. The Administration is taking swift action to stimulate job creation and economic growth, including increasing unemployment insurance benefits, extending the duration of unemployment insurance, and allocating over $3.5 billion to states for education, training, and reemployment services. The government also plans to restart lending for consumers and small businesses, assist responsible homeowners with their mortgages, and address long-term economic challenges such as healthcare costs, oil dependence, and the state of schools. The Secretary acknowledged that solving the economic crisis will be a difficult and prolonged process, but expressed confidence in the nation's resources and determination to overcome the challenge and emerge stronger.
