In this proclamation, President Donald J. Trump declares November 2019 as Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of securing and enhancing the resilience of the nation's infrastructure, which plays a crucial role in supporting the economy, national security, and way of life. The interconnectedness of infrastructure networks, such as power grids and communication platforms, is highlighted, as disruptions in one area can impact multiple sectors and communities. The proclamation acknowledges the diverse threats faced by the nation, including human-made, technological, and natural hazards. The Trump Administration has made strategic investments to address these threats, such as issuing executive orders on coordinating national resilience to electromagnetic pulses and securing the information and communications technology and services supply chain. The creation of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within the Department of Homeland Security is also mentioned as a step towards strengthening the nation's critical cyber and physical infrastructure. The proclamation emphasizes the need to protect the critical supply chain from foreign strategic competitors and encourages owners and operators of critical infrastructure to take measures to enhance security and resiliency. The roles of federal, state, and local governments, as well as the private sector, are highlighted in reducing risks to critical infrastructure. The proclamation calls upon all Americans to play a role in protecting the nation's infrastructure by investing in resilient technologies, preparing for emergencies, and remaining vigilant.
