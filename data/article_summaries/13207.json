President Barack Obama has notified Congress of his intent to terminate the designation of St. Kitts and Nevis as a beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. This decision is based on the determination that St. Kitts and Nevis has become a high-income country, as defined by the World Bank. As a result, St. Kitts and Nevis' eligibility for trade benefits under the GSP program will end on January 1, 2014.
