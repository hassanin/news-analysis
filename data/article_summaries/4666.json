The Government of Israel has decided to open its border crossing at Kerem Shalom to allow direct delivery of humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. This decision was communicated to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken by Israeli National Security Advisor Tzachi Hanegbi during Blinken's visit to Israel. President Biden had also discussed this issue with Prime Minister Netanyahu in recent phone calls. The United States is committed to increasing and sustaining the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. They will continue to work with Egypt and other partners to ensure the delivery and distribution of assistance through Rafah crossing. It is hoped that this new opening will alleviate congestion and facilitate the delivery of life-saving aid to those in urgent need in Gaza.
