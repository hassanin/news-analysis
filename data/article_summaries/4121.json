President Joe Biden has announced his intention to nominate Hampton Dellinger as Special Counsel for the Office of the Special Counsel. The Office of Special Counsel is an independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency that operates under four federal statutes: the Civil Service Reform Act, the Whistleblower Protection Act, the Hatch Act, and the Uniformed Services Employment & Reemployment Rights Act. Dellinger previously served as an Assistant Attorney General overseeing the Office of Legal Policy in the U.S. Department of Justice until June 2023. During his tenure, he worked on various policy projects, including updating guidelines for crime victims and contributing to the National Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking. Dellinger also played a coordinating role in the implementation of the President's Executive Order on Advancing Effective, Accountable Policing and Criminal Justice Practices, as well as the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. He has experience as a Deputy Attorney General in the North Carolina Department of Justice and as Chief Legal Counsel in the Office of the North Carolina Governor. Dellinger has represented whistleblowers and clients challenging government activities in his private practice, resulting in taxpayer savings. He holds a college degree from the University of Michigan and a law degree from Yale Law School.
