The United States, in coordination with the European Union (EU) and G7, has imposed sanctions on over 400 Russian elites, Duma members, and defense companies. This brings the total number of targets sanctioned by the US to over 600. The G7 and EU have also announced an initiative to prevent the evasion and backfilling of sanctions. The goal is to ensure that the Russian government feels the compounding effects of economic actions. The Russian economy is already experiencing significant consequences, with the ruble depreciating and the Moscow Stock Exchange closing. The Central Bank of the Russian Federation has doubled interest rates, and companies are being forced to exchange foreign currency for rubles. The Russian economy is expected to contract by 15 percent or more in 2022, wiping out the past 15 years of economic gains. Inflation is spiking, and major credit rating agencies have downgraded the Russian government to "junk" status. Over 400 multinational companies have left Russia. The US and its allies are committed to imposing further severe costs on those enabling President Putin's war against Ukraine. The actions taken include full blocking sanctions on individuals and entities, establishment of an initiative to combat sanctions evasion, and efforts to limit the Central Bank's ability to deploy international reserves, including gold.
