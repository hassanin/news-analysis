The US government is warning about potential cyberattacks from Russia and urging private sector companies to strengthen their cybersecurity measures. The government has been working to enhance national cyber defenses and has mandated cybersecurity measures for the federal government and critical infrastructure sectors. Congress has also collaborated with the government to require companies to report cyber incidents. However, as most critical infrastructure is owned by the private sector, it is crucial for these companies to take immediate action to improve their cyber defenses. The Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has been assisting organizations in sharing information and guidance to protect their systems. The government emphasizes the need for private sector partners to implement best practices and contribute to the cybersecurity and resilience of critical services and technologies.
