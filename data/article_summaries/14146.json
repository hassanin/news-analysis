In this article, President Barack Obama issues a memorandum concerning medical liability reform. He acknowledges the need to improve patient safety and reform the medical liability system, as between 44,000 and 98,000 patients die each year from medical errors. The high cost of medical malpractice premiums for physicians and the practice of defensive medicine are also highlighted. Obama emphasizes that medical liability reform should be part of broader health insurance reform that provides security and stability for insured Americans, extends coverage to those without insurance, and slows the growth of healthcare costs. He mentions the recommendation to fund demonstration projects to test different medical liability models and determine effective reforms. The goals and core commitments of malpractice reform include prioritizing patient safety, improving doctor-patient communication, ensuring fair and timely compensation for medical injuries, and reducing the incidence of frivolous lawsuits and liability premiums. The President requests that the Department of Health and Human Services make demonstration grants available for the development, implementation, and evaluation of alternatives to the current medical liability system.
