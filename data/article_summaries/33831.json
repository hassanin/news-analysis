President Donald J. Trump has declared a state of emergency in Alaska and ordered federal assistance to supplement the state, tribal, and local response efforts following an earthquake on November 30, 2018. The Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will coordinate all disaster relief efforts aimed at alleviating the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency. FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. Emergency protective measures will be provided at 75 percent federal funding in certain affected areas. Willie G. Nunn has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. For more information, media can contact the FEMA news desk.
