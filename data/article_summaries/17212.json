Governor Jennifer M. Granholm has expressed her support for a compromise reached by President Obama and members of Congress to extend unemployment insurance, tax cuts for working families, and other business incentives. She believes that this pragmatic approach will provide relief to Michigan's working families during these difficult economic times. Governor Granholm emphasized the importance of extending unemployment benefits, as more than 181,000 Michigan residents would exhaust their benefits by the end of April without an extension. She urged Congress to quickly approve the framework, which includes a 13-month extension of unemployment benefits, an extension of existing middle-class tax cuts, a two percent payroll tax cut for working people for one year, an extension of the earned income tax credit, and business incentives such as allowing businesses to expense all investments made in 2011 and a two-year extension of the R&D tax credit.
