President Donald Trump has announced that he will continue the national emergency that was declared after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. This declaration, which was first made in 2001, is being extended for another year due to the ongoing threat of further attacks on the United States. The President states that the powers and authorities adopted to address this emergency must remain in effect beyond September 14, 2019. The notice of this extension will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
