President Trump's tough diplomacy has resulted in the release of three American hostages held in North Korea. While the administration is encouraged by this development, they will continue to exert pressure until complete denuclearization is achieved. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo played a crucial role in overseeing the release of Kim Dong Chul, Tony Kim, and Kim Hak Song. The President expresses pride and welcomes the hostages back home.
