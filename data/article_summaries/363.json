President Biden has issued a memorandum titled "Modernizing Regulatory Review" with the goal of improving and updating the regulatory review process. The memorandum reaffirms the principles set forth in previous executive orders and emphasizes the need to evaluate and enhance the processes and principles that govern regulatory review to ensure effective federal action. The memorandum directs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to begin a process, in consultation with executive departments and agencies, to produce recommendations for improving regulatory review. These recommendations should promote public health and safety, economic growth, social welfare, racial justice, environmental stewardship, human dignity, equity, and the interests of future generations. They should also include proposals to affirmatively promote regulations that advance these values. Public engagement with stakeholders should inform these recommendations. The memorandum highlights specific areas for improvement, such as modernizing the regulatory review process to reflect new scientific and economic understanding, considering distributional consequences of regulations, exploring ways for OIRA to partner with agencies for significant regulatory benefits, and promoting efficiency, transparency, and inclusiveness in the interagency review process. The memorandum concludes with general provisions, including the recognition of existing authorities, the implementation of the memorandum consistent with applicable law and appropriations, and the lack of creating any enforceable rights or benefits. The Director of OMB is authorized to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
