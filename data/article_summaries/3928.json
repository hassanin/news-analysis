In a briefing at the State Dining Room, President Biden emphasized the need for preparedness as the country faces overlapping challenges of wildfires, hurricanes, and the spread of the Delta variant. He commended Administrator Criswell for her outstanding work in navigating these crises. The President urged everyone to get vaccinated, stating that the Delta variant is spreading rapidly among the unvaccinated. He highlighted that states with low vaccination rates, such as Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi, are at higher risk, particularly during hurricane season. The President emphasized the importance of being vaccinated to protect against COVID-19 during natural disasters and evacuation situations. He encouraged people to visit Ready.gov for hurricane preparedness resources and to make plans with their families and pets. Additionally, he suggested checking in on older neighbors and helping them make a plan. The President concluded by stating that while hurricanes cannot be prevented, the severity of COVID-19 can be mitigated through vaccination and preparedness.
