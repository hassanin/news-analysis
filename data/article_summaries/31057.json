President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Nebraska and has ordered Federal assistance to aid in the recovery efforts following a severe winter storm and straight-line winds that occurred between April 29 and May 3, 2017. Federal funding will be available to State, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in several counties. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also be eligible for federal funding. David G. Samaniego has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
