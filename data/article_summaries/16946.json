President Obama has declared a major disaster in the state of Oklahoma and has ordered federal aid to assist with recovery efforts following severe winter storms and flooding that occurred from November 27-29, 2015. Federal funding will be available to state, tribal, and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures will also be eligible for federal funding. William J. Doran III has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, contact the FEMA News Desk.
