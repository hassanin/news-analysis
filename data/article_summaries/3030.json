President Biden delivered a speech at the Rose Garden, celebrating the protection of Bristol Bay in Alaska as part of his administration's land and water conservation agenda. He thanked the individuals and groups who worked together to protect the bay, which is home to the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world and supports thousands of jobs and a multi-billion dollar economy. The President highlighted the importance of conserving natural resources and the need to listen to scientists and tribal leaders in making decisions about environmental protection. He also discussed his administration's efforts to conserve and protect other natural areas across the country, including the Tongass National Forest, national monuments, and marine sanctuaries. President Biden emphasized the significance of conservation in preserving the nation's identity and called for unity in working towards these goals. He also criticized the extreme Republicans who are threatening to default on the national debt, which would have negative consequences for conservation efforts and the economy. The President concluded by expressing his hope for future generations to continue enjoying the abundance of Bristol Bay and the country's natural wonders.
