On March 21, 2017, President Donald Trump signed into law the "National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017." This Act provides appropriations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for the fiscal year 2017 and makes amendments to its authorities. However, the President has stated that certain provisions of the Act, such as sections 301, 303, and 414, which require the executive branch to undertake specific international diplomatic initiatives regarding the space program, will be treated in a manner that does not interfere with the President's exclusive constitutional authority to conduct international diplomacy. Additionally, sections 303(c), 305(a), and 702(e) of the Act, which aim to constrain the discretion of the Administrator of NASA in recommending legislative measures to Congress, will be treated in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to supervise the executive branch and make recommendations to Congress.
