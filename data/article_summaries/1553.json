President Biden has called on Congress to take action to prevent default and met with Congressional leaders to discuss a bipartisan budget framework. However, Republicans are pushing the country to the brink of default by recycling an extreme budget proposal that could result in job losses, cuts to law enforcement positions, and put healthcare coverage at risk while extending tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations. Republicans are also trying to gut funding for the IRS and have refused to discuss revenue in budget negotiations. President Biden has proposed a balanced approach to reduce the deficit and cut wasteful spending, but Republicans are focused on undermining the progress made. A reasonable bipartisan agreement is still possible if Republicans negotiate in good faith, but President Biden will not accept extreme priorities that harm the middle class and the most vulnerable Americans.
