On May 12, 2014, the President of the United States declared a national emergency due to the situation in and around the Central African Republic. This situation is characterized by a breakdown of law and order, sectarian tensions, widespread violence and atrocities, and the forced recruitment and use of child soldiers. The national emergency was declared under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to address the threat to national security and foreign policy. The President has now announced that the national emergency will continue beyond May 12, 2021, as the situation still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. The notice of the extension will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
