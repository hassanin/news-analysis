This article is a message from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating that the national emergency with respect to Somalia is to continue beyond April 12, 2014. The President has sent a notice to the Federal Register to publish this information. The United States recognized the Government of Somalia on January 17, 2013, after not recognizing a government in Somalia for the previous 22 years. However, the recognition does not diminish the importance of U.S. sanctions against individuals who undermine Somalia's stability. Therefore, the national emergency and the sanctions will continue to address this threat. The message is signed by President Barack Obama.
