President Obama held a call with Parish Presidents, Mayors, and County Leaders from Louisiana and Mississippi who were affected by Hurricane Isaac. He asked Secretary Napolitano and Administrator Fugate to update the officials on the resources and steps FEMA has taken to support their communities and first responders. The President expressed his sympathy for the extensive damage caused by the storm and assured the officials that FEMA would continue to provide resources for response and recovery efforts. FEMA teams have been on the ground since before the storm, providing supplies and support. The President approved Emergency Declarations for both states and expedited Major Disaster declarations, making additional federal resources available. Individual Assistance was also approved for Louisiana, allowing federal funding for affected individuals. The President urged the officials to continue identifying needs as response and recovery efforts continue.
