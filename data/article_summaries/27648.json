On July 14, 2017, President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump attended the annual Bastille Day ceremonies in Paris, France. The French National Day celebrates the storming of the Bastille in 1789, a significant event in the French Revolution. This year, the United States was the guest of honor to commemorate the 100th anniversary of American troops entering France during World War I and to highlight the strong friendship between the two countries. Around 200 US service members participated in the Military Parade, and the Thunderbirds, the US Air Force demonstration team, conducted a fly-over. Three US veterans of the Normandy invasion were also present. The President and First Lady expressed their gratitude to President and Madame Macron for hosting them, and they departed for the United States after the conclusion of the festivities.
