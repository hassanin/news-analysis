Second Lady Karen Pence visited Charlotte to raise awareness about mental health and veteran suicide prevention efforts. She participated in a Veteran Suicide Prevention Roundtable with Dr. Elinore McCance-Katz, Congressman Dan Bishop, and organizations involved in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Governor's & Mayor's Challenges. They discussed increasing access to services, strengthening the continuum of care, and measuring impact and quality of care. 

Mrs. Pence also visited a military spouse-owned business, DocTerra Mobile Veterinary Services, where she met with the owner, Dr. Terra Smith, her USMC veteran husband, and representatives from the Small Business Administration (SBA). She learned about how the SBA supported the business and its growth during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Later, Mrs. Pence and Dr. McCance-Katz visited HopeWay Mental Health Treatment Center for a roundtable discussion on mental health resources and veteran programs. They heard from art and music therapists about the center's therapy programs and the center's veteran coordinator discussed the support provided to veterans. Mrs. Pence emphasized the importance of addressing mental health issues and discussed her role as the Lead Ambassador for PREVENTS, an initiative to raise awareness about mental health and suicide prevention for veterans. Testimonials from two clients at the treatment facility were also shared during the discussion.
