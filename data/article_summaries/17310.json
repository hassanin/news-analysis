In this press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney addresses questions about the initial administration explanation on the Benghazi incident and the growing threat of al Qaeda-affiliated groups in North Africa. Carney defends the administration's response to Benghazi, stating that no one took the loss of four American lives more seriously than the President and Secretary of State. He also emphasizes that the focus should be on bringing those responsible to justice and preventing future tragedies, rather than obsessing over talking points. Carney argues that al Qaeda central has been decimated, but acknowledges that al Qaeda-affiliate groups may still be growing. He reiterates the administration's commitment to countering these threats and protecting U.S. interests. The press briefing also covers topics such as the nomination of General John Allen, the U.S.'s relationship with the UK and the EU, climate change, and the Israeli elections. Carney declines to speculate on future actions or comment on specific legislation.
