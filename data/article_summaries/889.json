President Biden is announcing seven nominees for the U.S. Sentencing Commission, an independent agency created to reduce sentencing disparities and promote transparency in criminal sentencing. The Commission has lacked a quorum since 2019, hindering its ability to conduct important work. The nominees include Judge Carlton W. Reeves, who would become the first Black chair of the organization, Laura Mate, Claire McCusker Murray, Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo, Judge Claria Horn Boom, Judge John Gleeson, and Candice C. Wong. Each nominee has extensive experience in the legal field and would contribute to the Commission's mission if confirmed.
