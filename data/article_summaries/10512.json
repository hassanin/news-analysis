President Barack Obama has issued a proclamation declaring October 4-10, 2009, as Fire Prevention Week. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of fire safety and urges Americans to take simple steps to prevent fires, such as being attentive while cooking, properly disposing of smoking materials, and regularly checking smoke alarm batteries. The theme for this year's Fire Prevention Week is "Stay Fire Smart! Don't Get Burned," focusing on burn awareness and prevention. The proclamation also recognizes the brave firefighters and volunteers who risk their lives to protect others from fire. It calls on Americans to participate in fire prevention programs and activities and to renew their efforts to prevent fires and their tragic consequences. On October 4, 2009, the flag of the United States will be flown at half-staff on all Federal office buildings in honor of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service.
