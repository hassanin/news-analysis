During a press briefing, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen and U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan provided updates on the immigration crisis at the southern border. Nielsen emphasized the increase in illegal immigration, including a 325% increase in unaccompanied alien children and a 435% increase in family units entering the country illegally. She argued that loopholes in federal immigration laws are responsible for the current crisis and called on Congress to close these loopholes. Nielsen also addressed concerns about the separation of families, stating that separation occurs when there is no documentation to confirm a familial relationship, if the parent is a national security or safety risk, or if there are criminal charges involved. She emphasized that children in government custody are well taken care of and that parents can communicate with their children through phone calls and video conferencing. Nielsen defended the administration's enforcement of the law and called on Congress to take action to fix the immigration system.
