Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at the East Room, acknowledging the long-awaited establishment of Juneteenth as a national holiday. She recognized the advocates and leaders who have been advocating for this day, including Opal Lee, who received special recognition from President Joe Biden. Harris emphasized the significance of national holidays as moments to acknowledge history and take stock as a nation. She explained that Juneteenth, celebrated on June 19, 1865, was not the end of slavery in America, as the Emancipation Proclamation had already ended slavery in the Confederacy two and a half years earlier. It would take another six months for the 13th Amendment to be ratified, fully freeing enslaved people in the South and the North. Harris stressed the importance of learning and teaching this history, as it is an integral part of American history. She concluded by celebrating the establishment of Juneteenth as a national holiday and encouraging continued action towards progress. President Biden then took the stage to commemorate the occasion.
