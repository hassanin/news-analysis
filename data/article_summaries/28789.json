President Donald J. Trump has praised Congress for passing H.J. Res. 111, which disapproves of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) Arbitration Agreements Rule. A recent report by the Department of the Treasury concluded that the CFPB's rule would not protect consumers or serve the public interest. Instead, it would limit consumers' options for resolving financial disputes and potentially lead to frivolous lawsuits by special interest trial lawyers. By repealing the rule, Congress is supporting everyday consumers and community banks and credit unions, rather than trial lawyers who would have benefited the most from the CFPB's ineffective policy.
