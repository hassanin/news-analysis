The Department of Justice (DOJ) has conducted a review of the use of solitary confinement in American prisons, as requested by the President. The DOJ has developed strategies for reducing the use of solitary confinement, also known as restrictive housing, in the criminal justice system. The President has announced that he will adopt the recommendations in the DOJ's report and direct federal agencies to review and address their use of solitary confinement. The report sets out more than 50 guiding principles for all correctional systems, including housing inmates in the least restrictive setting necessary for safety, clearly articulating the reasons for placing inmates in restrictive housing, and developing plans for returning inmates to less restrictive conditions. The report also addresses the Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) use of restrictive housing and makes recommendations such as ending restrictive housing for juveniles, diverting inmates with serious mental illness to alternative housing, and limiting the use of punitive segregation. The BOP will also increase transparency by publishing monthly data on restrictive housing and improving tracking of inmates in restrictive housing.
