National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan met with Belarusian opposition leader Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya to express American support for the people of Belarus and admiration for the opposition's courage in fighting for democracy and human rights. The United States, along with its partners and allies, will continue to hold the Lukashenka regime accountable through sanctions. Sullivan also reiterated the Biden Administration's demands for a credible international investigation into the events of May 23, the immediate release of political prisoners, and a genuine political dialogue with opposition leaders and civil society groups that leads to free and fair presidential elections under OSCE observation.
