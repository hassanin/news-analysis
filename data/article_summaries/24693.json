President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Oklahoma and authorized Federal aid to assist in recovery efforts from a severe winter storm that occurred in January 2010. The Federal funding will be available to State and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work, facility repairs, and hazard mitigation measures. Gregory W. Eaton has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for the recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
