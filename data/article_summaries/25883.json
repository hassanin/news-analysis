On January 30, 2017, President Donald Trump issued an executive order titled "Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs." The purpose of this order is to promote prudent and responsible spending of funds, both public and private, by managing the costs associated with complying with federal regulations. The order states that for every new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations must be identified for elimination. It also sets a regulatory cap for fiscal year 2017, directing that the total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, shall be no greater than zero, unless otherwise required by law or approved by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The order further requires agencies to submit annual regulatory cost submissions to the Office of Management and Budget, identifying the offsetting regulations and providing an approximation of the costs or savings associated with each new regulation or repealed regulation. The order defines "regulation" as an agency statement that implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy, or describes agency procedures or practices. It also includes provisions stating that the order does not impair the authority granted to executive departments or agencies by law, and that it does not create any right or benefit enforceable by any party against the United States or its entities.
