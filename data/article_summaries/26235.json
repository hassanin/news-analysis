On May 12, 2014, President Trump declared a national emergency in response to the situation in and in relation to the Central African Republic, which was marked by a breakdown of law and order, sectarian tension, violence, atrocities, and the forced use of child soldiers. This national emergency was declared under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and was deemed necessary to address the threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. The situation in the Central African Republic continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat, and therefore, the national emergency declared in 2014 will remain in effect beyond May 12, 2018. The announcement was made in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
