This article is a Presidential Proclamation by Barack Obama regarding various trade agreements and modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) of the United States. The proclamation terminates the designation of Burundi as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country, modifies the HTS to ensure that imports of sugar do not disrupt the marketing of commodities, and makes technical corrections to provide the intended tariff treatment to goods of St. Kitts and Nevis, Panama, Colombia, Bahrain, and Korea. The proclamation also states that any previous provisions inconsistent with these actions are superseded.
