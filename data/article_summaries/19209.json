President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Iowa, ordering federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts after a severe winter storm and snowstorm that occurred in December 2009. The declaration makes federal funding available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and emergency protective measures in various counties. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has named Thomas A. Hall as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made later if requested by the state and warranted by further damage assessments. For more information, contact FEMA.
