The Biden-Harris Administration has made significant efforts to support Puerto Rico's recovery and renewal. They have unlocked unprecedented disaster recovery funds, removed unfair restrictions, and approved billions of dollars for projects such as school restoration, streetlight repair, and water and electrical infrastructure improvements. The American Rescue Plan provided relief for families and small businesses affected by the pandemic, including direct payments, unemployment benefits, and food assistance. It also made important permanent changes to federal tax benefits in Puerto Rico, providing over $1 billion in tax relief per year. The administration established a White House Working Group on Puerto Rico to provide resources and technical assistance, and made additional Medicaid funds available to address healthcare needs. The historic Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will invest in rebuilding roads, bridges, public transportation, broadband coverage, water infrastructure, and airport development in Puerto Rico. The Department of Education has awarded billions in education resources, and efforts have been made to promote transparency, data accessibility, and clean, resilient, and affordable energy. Small businesses and job creators have received support through aid, loans, and programs. The administration has also accelerated COVID-19 vaccinations and enhanced reporting efforts in Puerto Rico.
