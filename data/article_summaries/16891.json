The Promise Zones Initiative is a program introduced by President Obama to create opportunities and improve living conditions in struggling communities. The initiative aims to partner with local communities and businesses to create jobs, increase economic security, expand educational opportunities, improve access to affordable housing, and enhance public safety. The first five Promise Zones have been announced, located in San Antonio, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Southeastern Kentucky, and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. Each zone has developed plans to collaborate with local leaders and businesses to achieve their goals, and in return, they will receive resources and flexibility to implement their plans. The initiative emphasizes the importance of collaboration between various stakeholders, including federal, state, tribal, and local officials, non-profit organizations, and community members. The article also highlights the strategies and goals of each of the five Promise Zones. The Promise Zones Initiative will continue to announce 20 more zones over the next three years. These zones will focus on specific outcomes such as job creation, economic activity, education, affordable housing, and reduced crime. The initiative will provide intensive federal support to the zones, help them access resources, and prioritize federal investments to further their goals. Additionally, each Promise Zone will receive five full-time AmeriCorps VISTA members to support their strategic plans and expand economic opportunities. The initiative also aims to invest in strategies that have proven effectiveness and proposes tax cuts for businesses in Promise Zones to attract investment and create jobs.
