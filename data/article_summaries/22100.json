The White House is taking steps to combat wildlife trafficking, which is a multi-billion dollar illegal business that is endangering animal populations, especially elephants and rhinoceroses. The United States is working with international partners to reduce demand, strengthen enforcement, and build capacity to address this issue. The President will sign an Executive Order to enhance coordination of U.S. Government efforts and establish a Presidential Task Force on Wildlife Trafficking. The U.S. Department of State will provide $10 million in training and technical assistance in Africa to combat wildlife trafficking, and USAID will launch a wildlife technology challenge. The Department of Interior U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service will assign an official to the Embassy in Tanzania to support the development of a wildlife security strategy. The United States is also enhancing regulations and leveraging the Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program to combat wildlife trafficking. These efforts build on ongoing activities, such as capacity building, conservation efforts, and building partnerships with international organizations and governments. The United States is also raising the issue of wildlife trafficking in international fora and advocating for increased penalties for traffickers.
