President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Texas due to Tropical Storm Imelda. This declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to individuals in the affected counties for temporary housing, home repairs, and low-cost loans for uninsured property losses. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has named Jerry S. Thomas as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. seven days a week until further notice. For more information, contact the FEMA News Desk.
