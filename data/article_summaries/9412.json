The White House hosted a briefing on August 4, 2009, to discuss the need to involve vulnerable communities in the emerging green economy. The briefing was attended by members of Green the Block, and immediately following, there was a press conference to announce the first major initiative of the campaign. The Obama Administration is committed to building a clean energy economy that drives national recovery through innovation, entrepreneurship, and job creation. Green the Block aims to engage vulnerable communities in the transition to a 21st-century economy through education, legislative advocacy, private-sector development, and youth activism. The event was attended by Administration representatives, including Secretary Shaun Donovan, Administrator Lisa Jackson, and Under Secretary Kristina Johnson, as well as leaders from Green For All and the Hip Hop Caucus.
