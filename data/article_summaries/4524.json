President Biden and Vice President Harris marked the one-year anniversary of their administration by convening the Infrastructure Implementation Task Force. They discussed the progress made in the first two months of implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which is the largest long-term investment in America's infrastructure in almost a century. President Biden emphasized his priorities, including creating good-paying, union jobs, supporting domestic manufacturing, strengthening supply chains, advancing equity and racial justice, and addressing climate change. Cabinet members and the task force provided updates on their efforts to repair roads and bridges, replace lead pipes, provide clean water, expand high-speed internet access, and achieve tangible results that improve people's lives. President Biden also instructed Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator Mitch Landrieu to ensure accountability and responsible use of taxpayer dollars by collaborating with federal, state, local, and Tribal governments.
