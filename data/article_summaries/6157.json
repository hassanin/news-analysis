During a meeting at the Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow, President Biden highlighted the importance of conserving forests and other ecosystems in order to achieve climate goals. He acknowledged the commitment of the presidents of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gabon to forest conservation. President Biden announced a new plan to conserve global forests, which will involve the use of diplomatic, financial, and policy tools to halt forest loss, restore carbon sinks, and improve land management. The United States aims to conserve and restore an additional 200 million hectares of forests and other ecosystems by 2030. This plan will involve a whole-of-government approach and up to $9 billion in U.S. funding, with additional support from partners. The United States will also work to align private sector investment and promote sustainable practices. The involvement of local communities, Indigenous peoples, and civil societies will be prioritized to ensure effective and inclusive approaches. President Biden emphasized that preserving forests is crucial for meeting ambitious climate goals and that the United States will lead by example and support other nations in their conservation efforts.
