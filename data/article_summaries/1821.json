Oklahoma has signed into law the most restrictive legislation on reproductive health care in the country. The law bans abortion in the state, except for medical emergencies and does not provide exceptions for rape or incest. The Biden-Harris Administration considers this law an unconstitutional attack on women's rights and calls on Congress to pass the Women's Health Protection Act to protect the right recognized in Roe v. Wade. They view this law as part of a national trend attacking women's rights and pledge to stand with women in Oklahoma and across the country to defend their freedom to make their own choices about their futures.
