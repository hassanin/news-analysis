President Biden delivered a speech at the South Court Auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, announcing the establishment of a new manufacturing facility called Tritium. The facility will produce electric vehicle chargers and create over 500 jobs in Tennessee. The President emphasized the significance of this announcement, stating that it will not only benefit Tennessee but also have a ripple effect across the country and contribute to a more sustainable future. He highlighted the $7.5 billion allocated for electric vehicle chargers in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and mentioned that $5 billion of that funding will be allocated to states for the development of a national network of electric vehicle chargers. Tritium's facility will produce up to 30,000 chargers annually using American parts and will be installed nationwide by union workers. President Biden expressed his commitment to supporting American manufacturing and investing in innovation and manufacturing to create jobs and lower prices. He cited the example of Intel's $20 billion semiconductor factory in Ohio, which will create thousands of jobs and help ease inflation. The President emphasized that the United States is at an inflection point and that the country is poised to outcompete the world once again. He called for continued investments in American manufacturing and collaboration between Republicans and Democrats to achieve economic success.
