The May Employment Situation Report highlights several positive aspects of the US labor market. The unemployment rate remained at 3.6 percent, matching the lowest rate in almost 50 years. The unemployment rate for Hispanics also matched its lowest rate since 1973, while the rate for African Americans fell to 6.2 percent, nearing its historic low. The unemployment rate for those with some college or an associate degree reached its lowest rate since 2001. Wage growth continued, with nominal average hourly earnings rising by 3.1 percent over the past 12 months. Real wages, taking inflation into account, are also growing. The economy added 75,000 jobs in May, maintaining the streak of over 100 consecutive months of job gains. While payroll employment growth fell short of expectations, overall job growth, wage growth, and the low unemployment rate reflect the continued strength of the US labor market. To sustain job growth, efforts are needed to bring more individuals into the workforce, such as through programs like the Pledge to America's Workers.
