President Trump has extended the Coronavirus Guidelines for America for another 30 days in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. By following these guidelines and practicing social distancing, it is believed that more than 1 million American lives can be saved in the coming weeks and months. The coordination between the Federal Government and all 50 states has allowed for the expedited access to much-needed medical supplies. Dr. Anthony Fauci has emphasized the importance of continuing these measures and not easing up on social distancing. The Surgeon General also emphasizes the need for everyone to work together to flatten the curve even further.
