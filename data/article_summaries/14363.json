First Lady Michelle Obama will be harvesting the White House Kitchen Garden and preparing a fresh, healthy meal with ingredients from the garden. She will be joined by Rachael Ray, a child nutrition advocate and member of the President's Council on Fitness, Sports & Nutrition, and Frankie Celenza from Tastemade. The garden was planted in 2009 to initiate a national conversation about health and wellbeing, which led to the Let's Move! initiative. Students from Wisconsin, Colorado, and Louisiana with inspiring school garden programs will be in attendance, along with students from Bancroft Elementary School and Harriet Tubman Elementary School who regularly help in the garden. The event will showcase the increase and impact of school gardens across the country. The article also provides information about the garden programs of the participating students from Washburn, Wisconsin; Cortez, Colorado; and New Orleans, Louisiana. The event will be livestreamed on the White House website.
