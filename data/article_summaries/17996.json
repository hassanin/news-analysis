This article is a notice from the President, Barack Obama, regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to transnational criminal organizations. The national emergency was declared on July 24, 2011, in response to the activities of significant transnational criminal organizations that posed a threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. These organizations are becoming more sophisticated and dangerous, and they are also involved in the operations of foreign governments and the international financial system. This undermines democratic institutions, degrades the rule of law, and threatens economic markets. The national emergency and the measures taken to address it will continue for another year, as it is still deemed necessary to protect the national security and interests of the United States.
