On December 20, 2017, President Donald Trump issued an Executive Order declaring a national emergency with respect to the threat posed by serious human rights abuse and corruption around the world. The order implements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and delegates certain authorities. It blocks the property and interests in property of individuals involved in serious human rights abuse or corruption. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, has the power to determine who falls under these categories. The order also suspends the entry into the United States of any alien listed in the order or determined to meet certain criteria. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of State have been given the authority to take necessary actions to implement the order and relevant provisions of the Act. All executive departments and agencies are directed to take appropriate measures to enforce the order.
