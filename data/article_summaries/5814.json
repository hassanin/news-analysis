The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the Affordable Care Act (ACA), marking a major victory for Americans benefiting from the law. This decision is especially significant for the 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions and those at risk of losing healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ACA ensures that individuals cannot be denied coverage or have their coverage limited due to pre-existing conditions. It also allows young people to stay on their parents' insurance until the age of 26 and provides healthcare for low-income families and people with disabilities through Medicaid expansion. Despite years of opposition, this ruling affirms the strength and importance of the ACA. Moving forward, the government aims to build upon this landmark law to further improve access to quality and affordable healthcare.
