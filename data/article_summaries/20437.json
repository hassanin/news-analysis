Dr. Jill Biden joined the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) to announce a new Joining Forces commitment aimed at educating all social workers on issues relating to the care, culture, and lifestyle of veterans and military families. This commitment means that over 650,000 social workers will have access to training and resources to better meet the needs of service members, veterans, and military families. The goal is to provide support for issues such as mental and behavioral health, substance abuse, unemployment, homelessness, and suicide. The NASW will offer a free online training module, a professional credential for social workers working with veterans and military families, and guidelines for social work practice in this area. The initiative is part of the Joining Forces program, which focuses on improving employment, education, and wellness for service members and their families.
