Yesterday, the National Climate Task Force, led by Senior Advisor to the President for Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation John Podesta and National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi, discussed the implementation of President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. The act aims to lower energy costs for American families, promote energy security, create jobs, advance environmental justice, and help the US meet its climate goals. The task force received briefings from Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen on providing guidance for taxpayers regarding the act's provisions, Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry on the upcoming COP27 conference, and Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda Mallory on the administration's commitment to environmental justice. The task force reaffirmed the disproportionate impact of climate change on low-income communities and communities of color and committed to prioritizing programs in the Inflation Reduction Act. The act, along with other legislative accomplishments, positions the US as a leader on the international stage. The task force includes Cabinet-level leaders from over 25 federal agencies.
