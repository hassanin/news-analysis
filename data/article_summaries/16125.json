On January 12, 2015, the President signed into law H.R. 26, known as the "Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015." This law extends the authorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program until December 31, 2020, and includes some modifications to the program. Additionally, the law establishes a National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers and exempts certain swap participants from capital requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
