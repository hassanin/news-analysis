President Obama has declared a major disaster in Louisiana and authorized federal aid to assist in recovery efforts following severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding that occurred between October 29 and November 3, 2009. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. The affected parishes include Beauregard, Bossier, Caldwell, Claiborne, De Soto, Natchitoches, Ouachita, Union, and Webster. Gerard M. Stolar has been appointed as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the area. Additional designations may be made if requested by the State and deemed necessary based on further damage assessments.
