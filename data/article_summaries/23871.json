The Obama Administration has launched a new online tool called the Do Not Pay tool, which aims to prevent the waste of taxpayer dollars on improper payments. This tool will help prevent payment errors such as sending funds to deceased individuals or entering into contracts with fraudulent companies. The President has proposed measures in his budget to save taxpayers $102 billion over the next decade by reducing payment errors and improving the collection of outstanding debts owed to the government. However, Congress has not taken action on these proposals yet. In the meantime, the Administration has created the Do Not Pay portal at the Department of the Treasury, which brings together multiple government databases to identify and stop wasteful errors before they happen. The government-wide improper payment rate has decreased from 5.4 percent in 2009 to 4.7 percent last year due to the Administration's reform efforts. The Administration has also exceeded the goal of recapturing $2 billion in overpayments to contractors by the end of this fiscal year. The Do Not Pay tool will be used by every major government agency by the spring of next year to combat improper payments and reduce government waste.
