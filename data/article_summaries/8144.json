Today, Jen Klein, Director of the White House Gender Policy Council, and Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Senior Advisor to the President, chaired a meeting with state legislative leaders to discuss efforts to advance access to reproductive health care. These efforts are in response to unprecedented attacks from Republican officials. So far this year, 12 states have enacted over 25 bills to protect and expand access to abortion. These bills include provisions to expand who can provide abortions, advance funding for abortion services, protect providers and patients, and codify the right to abortion into state law. In May, White House Senior Officials met with legislative leaders to discuss proactive reproductive rights legislation before the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson. After the decision, the President met with Governors to discuss executive action and support for state legislative agendas. Since then, states like California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York have passed legislation to support access to abortion. In the meeting, state legislative leaders discussed the steps they have taken and proposed measures to protect reproductive health and rights for the 2023 state legislative session. White House Senior Officials expressed gratitude for their efforts and ongoing partnership.
