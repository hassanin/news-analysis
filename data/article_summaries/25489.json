The United States Trade Representative (USTR) has directed the imposition of additional tariffs on approximately $200 billion of imports from China. The tariffs, initially set at 10 percent, will take effect on September 24, 2018, and will increase to 25 percent on January 1. If China retaliates against US farmers or other industries, phase three will involve tariffs on approximately $267 billion of additional imports. The USTR concluded that China's unfair policies and practices, such as technology transfer, pose a serious threat to the US economy. Despite urging China to change these practices, they have been unwilling to do so. The US administration aims to protect the interests of American workers, farmers, businesses, and the country itself. The hope is that the trade situation can be resolved through discussions between the US President and President Xi of China.
