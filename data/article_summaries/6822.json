President Biden held a briefing on gas prices at the South Court Auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. He started by apologizing for his voice and then shared the good news that gas prices have been consistently coming down. He mentioned that gas prices have fallen for 38 consecutive days and can now be found for $3.99 or less in over 30,000 gas stations in 35 states. President Biden highlighted the actions his administration has taken to address gas prices, such as releasing 1 million barrels of oil per day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and coordinating the largest release of oil reserves in history. He also mentioned efforts to increase U.S. oil production. However, he acknowledged that gas prices are still too high and outlined three steps to address the issue. First, he called on companies to use the approved permits for oil production on federal lands or risk losing them. Second, he urged companies to use their record profits to increase production and refining, rather than using them for stock buybacks and dividends. Lastly, he discussed a global price cap on Russian oil that he secured an agreement for at the G7 summit. President Biden emphasized the need to transition to a clean energy economy and mentioned cleaner renewable energy, affordable electric vehicles, and clean energy manufacturing in the U.S. as ways to protect the climate and create jobs. The briefing also covered market developments, industry engagement, and international developments. Chair Rouse provided an overview of declining gas prices and potential future declines, while Secretary Granholm discussed the work done with the industry and hurricane preparedness. Secretary Yellen and Amos provided an update on international developments. The briefing ended with President Biden giving a thumbs up and the press being asked to leave.
