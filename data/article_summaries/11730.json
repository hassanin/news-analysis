The Teamsters, represented by General President Jim Hoffa, have expressed their support for President Obama's American Jobs Act. Hoffa commended the President for presenting a jobs program with clear objectives and a practical approach to achieving them. He emphasized that the jobs crisis is not solely the responsibility of the President, Republicans, or Democrats, but rather a problem that all Americans need to come together to solve. Hoffa believes that passing this plan will immediately boost economic activity and generate more tax revenue, which will ultimately help fix the deficit. He highlighted the importance of investing in infrastructure improvements, creating jobs for military veterans, and putting money in the pockets of working people. The Teamsters will be studying the specific details of the plan as they are released.
