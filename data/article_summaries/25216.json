President Donald J. Trump has signed the United States instrument of ratification of the Protocol for Montenegro's accession to NATO. This comes after the Senate's bipartisan vote of advice and consent in support of ratification. NATO has been crucial in ensuring peace and security in Europe since its establishment in 1949. President Trump is looking forward to the NATO Leaders Meeting in May, where he will reaffirm transatlantic values. Montenegro's presence at the meeting will signal to other NATO aspirants that membership is still open. The United States will work on strengthening its relationship with Montenegro and officially welcoming them as the twenty-ninth member of NATO. President Trump commends the Montenegrin people for their resilience and commitment to democratic values.
