The Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2021 has been passed, which aims to provide lawful status and improved working conditions for farmworkers, many of whom are undocumented. This legislation recognizes the vital role that farmworkers play in feeding the nation, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. By supporting this act, the administration aims to bring stability to the agriculture industry and address the needs of essential workers. Additionally, the administration aims to create a safe and humane immigration system and address the root causes of migration to the United States.
