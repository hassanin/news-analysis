The United States military has conducted an operation to extract U.S. Government personnel from Khartoum in Sudan. The Embassy staff performed their duties with courage and professionalism, and the operation was successful thanks to the skill of the service members and the assistance of Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Saudi Arabia. The U.S. government is receiving regular reports on ongoing efforts to assist Americans in Sudan and is working with allies and partners. The violence in Sudan has cost the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians, and an immediate ceasefire, unhindered humanitarian access, and respect for the will of the Sudanese people are called for. The U.S. Embassy in Sudan is temporarily suspending operations, but the commitment to the Sudanese people remains strong.
