The President signed two bills into law. The first one is H.R. 1899, known as the "Ensuring Compliance Against Drug Diversion Act of 2021." This bill amends the Controlled Substances Act to provide statutory authority for modifying, transferring, and terminating registrations to manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substances. The second bill is S. 1064, known as the "Reinforcing Nicaragua's Adherence to Conditions for Electoral Reform Act of 2021" or the "RENACER Act." This bill imposes sanctions on the government of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, restricts multilateral bank lending, and targets regime corruption. The President thanked the lawmakers who played a role in these bills' development and passage.
