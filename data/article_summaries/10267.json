The statement by Austan Goolsbee, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, discusses the employment situation in November. The report shows that private sector payrolls increased by 50,000, although this was lower than expected. The unemployment rate also climbed to 9.8 percent. Goolsbee emphasizes the importance of extending tax cuts for the middle class and unemployment insurance to prevent job loss and support those who are out of work. The statement also mentions that private sector job growth for September and October was revised up, and overall payroll employment rose by 39,000 in November. Various sectors experienced growth, such as education and health services, while others, including retail trade, manufacturing, and state and local government jobs, experienced declines. Goolsbee acknowledges that while the economy has improved, there will continue to be challenges, and it is important to not read too much into one monthly report. The statement concludes by highlighting the need for additional targeted actions to increase growth and job creation, such as investing in infrastructure, providing tax incentives for businesses, and promoting exports.
