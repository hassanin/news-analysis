The article discusses the new UN Security Council sanctions on Iran that were adopted in response to Iran's refusal to comply with its international obligations regarding its nuclear program. The resolution, known as Resolution 1929, imposes a strong set of sanctions aimed at increasing the cost to Iran's leadership and persuading Iran to peacefully resolve concerns about its nuclear program.

The resolution builds on previous rounds of UN sanctions by strengthening and expanding existing measures and introducing new areas of sanctions. It reiterates the demand for Iran to suspend its enrichment program and other proscribed nuclear activities and clarifies Iran's obligations to accept and facilitate the implementation of rigorous international safeguards on its nuclear program.

The new sanctions include a ban on certain nuclear and missile investment abroad, a conventional arms ban, a ban on ballistic missile activities, additional items banned for transfer related to nuclear and missile proliferation, a new cargo inspection framework, new procedures to deal with contraband items, a ban on bunkering services, measures to restrict Iran's shipping lines and cargo division, new tools to block proliferation finance, vigilance over all Iranian companies, new banking measures, measures to limit the role of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), targeted sanctions on specific individuals and entities, and the appointment of a UN sanctions monitoring panel.

The resolution also highlights the potential linkage between Iran's energy sector revenues and its nuclear activities and stresses the need to exercise vigilance over all Iranian banks to prevent proliferation-related transactions. It reaffirms the international community's willingness to resolve concerns through negotiations and outlines the steps Iran must take to restore international confidence in its nuclear program for the suspension or termination of these sanctions.
