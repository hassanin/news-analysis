In this article, President Barack Obama issues a memorandum suspending the limitations set forth in the Jerusalem Embassy Act for a period of 6 months. The Act, passed in 1995, called for the relocation of the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. However, the President determines that it is necessary to suspend these limitations in order to protect the national security interests of the United States. The Secretary of State is instructed to transmit this determination to Congress and publish it in the Federal Register. The suspension will take effect after the transmission of the determination and report to Congress.
