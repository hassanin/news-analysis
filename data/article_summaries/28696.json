President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation recognizing Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers during Emergency Medical Services Week. The proclamation acknowledges the critical role that EMS providers play in the nation's health and safety, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic. These professionals, many of whom are volunteers, are highly trained and respond to urgent calls for assistance, providing pre-hospital assessment, trauma care, and medical transport. They also share valuable data with public health partners. The proclamation honors the dedication, courage, and sacrifice of EMS personnel and encourages all Americans to show their support for these brave individuals through appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
