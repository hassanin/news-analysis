The Biden administration has approved over $116 billion in debt cancellation for 3.4 million Americans as part of their efforts to fix problems in the student loan system. Many borrowers were not receiving credit for their loan payments or were placed into forbearance incorrectly. As a result, over 804,000 borrowers never received the forgiveness they were promised, even after making payments for decades. The administration is now taking action to cancel the student debt of these borrowers, with over 614,000 of them having all of their remaining federal student loan debt cancelled. The administration has also made other efforts to support students and borrowers, such as increasing Pell Grants and fixing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. They are continuing to pursue alternative paths to provide relief to as many borrowers as possible.
