President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran, which was declared on March 15, 1995, will continue beyond March 15, 2023. This decision has been made due to the ongoing actions and policies of the Government of Iran, which are deemed to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. As a result, comprehensive sanctions against Iran will be maintained in order to address this threat.
