The Trump Administration is urging all Senators to support the Motion to Proceed to H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017. They have been supporting multiple bills that repeal parts of Obamacare and include replacement provisions, such as market stability funding and an expansion of Health Savings Accounts. The Administration believes that inaction on healthcare reform is not an option and encourages Senators to move forward on repealing Obamacare and replacing it with reforms that expand choice and lower costs.
