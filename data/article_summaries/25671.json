The Trump Administration has announced the purchase and production of 150 million rapid tests for COVID-19. These tests, developed in partnership with Abbott Laboratories, are low cost, reliable, and easy to use. The goal is to protect vulnerable populations, reopen the country, and get people back to work and school. The United States is leading the world in testing and the development of reliable tests. The tests have received emergency use authorization from the FDA, and production will be scaled up to 50 million tests per month through Operation Warp Speed and Abbott Laboratories.
