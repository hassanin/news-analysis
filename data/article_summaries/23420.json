The Obama Administration has announced a series of federal and private sector actions to accelerate the integration of renewable energy and storage into the power grid. These actions include the release of a report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers on the technical and economic considerations of grid integration, commitments by the federal government to increase its storage and microgrid capacity, and the promotion of access to energy data by the U.S. Department of Energy. Additionally, 33 state and private sector commitments were announced, which are expected to result in at least 1.3 gigawatts of additional storage procurement or deployment in the next five years. These commitments include new storage projects, pilot projects, and investment in energy storage.
