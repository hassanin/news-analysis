President Trump has directed his administration to end "catch and release" and enhance immigration enforcement efforts. "Catch and release" is the practice of releasing immigrants who have violated immigration laws into the United States shortly after their apprehension. Within 45 days, the Departments of Homeland Security, Defense, Justice, and Health and Human Services will submit a report outlining past and ongoing efforts to end "catch and release." Another report will be submitted within 75 days detailing what additional resources or authorities are needed to achieve this goal. Additionally, within 60 days, a report will be submitted outlining measures being pursued to ensure removable aliens are returned to their home countries. The practice of "catch and release" has allowed an influx of illegal immigrants into the United States and encourages further illegal immigration. Legal loopholes and constraints on immigration enforcement have resulted in many illegal aliens being released into the country. The lack of resources and funding for detention space also hinders immigration enforcement efforts. President Trump believes it is necessary to provide federal authorities with the legal authority and resources they need to effectively enforce immigration laws in order to address the ongoing influx of illegal immigrants.
