President Trump has declared a major disaster in the state of New Hampshire and ordered federal assistance to help with recovery efforts following severe storms and flooding that occurred from July 1 to July 2, 2017. Federal funding will be available to the state, local governments, and certain nonprofit organizations for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. Hazard mitigation measures will also be funded on a cost-sharing basis statewide. Albert Lewis has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations, and additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the state and deemed necessary based on damage assessments.
