Yesterday, President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act (DPA) to address the shortage of infant formula in the United States and expand access to safe infant formula. The DPA gives the government the authority to require suppliers to prioritize infant formula manufacturers over other customers when it comes to necessary ingredients. This will help increase production and speed up supply chains. The DPA will be used to prioritize the production of key infant formula inputs such as oil, fat blend, labels, and cans. The goal is to maintain the higher levels of production that were put in place in February to address the shortage caused by the shutdown of the Abbott plant. Additionally, the administration announced Operation Fly Formula, which will use Department of Defense contracted commercial aircraft to speed up the import of infant formula that meets U.S. health and safety standards. This will bypass traditional cargo routes and get formula to stores faster. These actions build on previous administration efforts to reopen the Abbott Sturgis plant, allow safe importation of formula not currently produced for the U.S. market, and crack down on price gouging or unfair market practices. The administration is working closely with manufacturers, retailers, and state agencies to monitor supply and ensure formula is distributed to areas in need. The government is also actively engaging with manufacturers to identify suitable cargo around the world for importation. There is currently no indication of a shortage of formula materials, but the DPA will also be used to speed up delivery through the supply chain. The administration is committed to doing everything possible to ensure a sufficient supply of safe infant formula in the country.
