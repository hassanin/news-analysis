This article is a presidential proclamation by Barack Obama regarding certain actions being taken under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). The proclamation states that the President has the authority to designate countries as "beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries" if they meet certain eligibility requirements. It also mentions that special rules apply to certain apparel articles imported from "lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries." 

The proclamation specifically designates the Islamic Republic of Mauritania as an eligible sub-Saharan African country and as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country. It also terminates the designations of Guinea, Madagascar, and Niger as beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries, effective January 1, 2010. 

The proclamation concludes by stating that the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States will be modified to reflect these designations and terminations.
