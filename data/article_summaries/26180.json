President Donald J. Trump has proclaimed September 30, 2018, as Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day. This day is a solemn reminder of the sacrifice made by families who have lost loved ones in service to the country. Gold Star families, who have endured unimaginable sorrow, continue to show strength and determination by selflessly supporting their communities, veterans, and service members. The proclamation encourages government officials and the American people to display the flag and hold appropriate ceremonies as a public expression of gratitude and respect for Gold Star mothers and families.
