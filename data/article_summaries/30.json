The United States is showing solidarity with India by delivering supplies worth over $100 million to help with the country's battle against the new wave of COVID-19 cases. This assistance includes vital oxygen, related equipment, and essential supplies for Indian hospitals. U.S. government assistance flights will begin arriving in India on April 29 and will continue into the following week. The United States and India have been working closely together since the beginning of the pandemic, with U.S. COVID-19 assistance reaching over 9.7 million Indians across more than 20 states and union territories. This assistance has included life-saving treatments, public health messages, strengthening case-finding and surveillance, and mobilizing financing mechanisms for emergency preparedness. The United States is determined to help India in its time of need, just as India had previously provided assistance to the United States.
