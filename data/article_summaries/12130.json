President Obama has signed into law H.R. 644, the "Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015." This bipartisan legislation aims to strengthen trade enforcement at U.S. ports, combat evasion of enforcement actions, improve transparency and accountability, and address unfair currency practices. The Act provides new tools and authorities for U.S. companies and workers to hold trading partners accountable and investigate cases of duty evasion. It also enhances efforts to combat counterfeit goods and protect intellectual property rights. The Act establishes the Interagency Center on Trade Implementation, Monitoring, and Enforcement and provides new tools to engage with countries that do not adequately protect intellectual property rights. However, President Obama expressed concerns about certain provisions of the Act that conflate Israel and "Israeli-controlled territories" and stated that his administration will interpret and implement the provisions in a manner that does not interfere with his constitutional authority to conduct diplomacy.
