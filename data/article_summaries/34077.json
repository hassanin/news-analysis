President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of North Carolina and ordered Federal aid to assist in recovery efforts from Hurricane Florence. The declaration makes Federal funding available to affected individuals in certain counties, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for emergency work and hazard mitigation measures on a cost-sharing basis. Albert Lewis has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are still ongoing in other areas, and additional counties and forms of assistance may be designated in the future. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free numbers will be available seven days a week until further notice.
