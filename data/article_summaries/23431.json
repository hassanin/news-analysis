President Obama, Vice President Biden, and Secretary LaHood have announced a plan to create high-speed rail lines in the United States. The plan includes $8 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and $1 billion per year for five years from the federal budget. The goal is to reduce dependence on cars and planes, spur economic development, and provide a clean and energy-efficient option for travelers. The plan identifies ten potential high-speed rail corridors, including the California Corridor, Pacific Northwest Corridor, and Gulf Coast Corridor. The administration is urging states and local communities to develop plans for these corridors and compete for federal funding. The plan also emphasizes the environmental benefits of high-speed rail, such as reducing carbon emissions and energy consumption. The administration aims to begin awarding grants by late summer 2009.
