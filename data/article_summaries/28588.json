President Donald Trump has signed the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 2018 into law. The Act renames the Department of Homeland Security's Domestic Nuclear Detection Office as the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office (CWMD Office). The CWMD Office's role is to coordinate with other federal efforts and develop strategies and policies to plan for, detect, and protect against unauthorized chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear materials or devices in the United States. However, the Act raises constitutional concerns. Certain provisions of the Act require consultation with congressional committees before making changes to the "Securing the Cities" program, and the Secretary of Homeland Security is required to provide an annual report to Congress with recommendations for statutory changes regarding the CWMD Office. President Trump states that he will treat these provisions in a manner consistent with the Constitution's separation of powers and the President's discretionary powers.
