The article announces that the Obama administration has conditionally committed to providing loan guarantees for the construction of two new nuclear reactors in Georgia. The project is expected to be the first nuclear power plant built in the US in almost 30 years. The two new Westinghouse AP1000 reactors will complement the existing reactors at the Alvin W. Vogtle plant and create jobs during construction and operation. The Department of Energy will provide loan guarantees totaling $8.33 billion for the project. The Obama administration sees this as an important step towards revitalizing the national nuclear energy industry and meeting the growing energy needs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The project sponsors include Georgia Power Company, Oglethorpe Power Corporation, the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia, and the city of Dalton, Georgia. The loan guarantees are part of the Department of Energy's loan guarantee program, which aims to support projects that reduce air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and employ new or significantly improved technology. This is the first conditional loan guarantee for a nuclear power plant since the enactment of the 2005 Energy Policy Act. The Vogtle plant is expected to provide a secure electricity supply for 550,000 homes or 1.4 million people, while avoiding significant greenhouse gas emissions compared to a coal-fired plant. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission will determine if the AP1000 reactor meets the required standards for construction and operation. The Department of Energy has previously provided conditional loan guarantees for projects in the solar, wind, and energy storage sectors.
