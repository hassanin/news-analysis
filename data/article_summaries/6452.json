The speaker, who is the wife of Joe Biden, discusses the changing landscape of education and workforce development. She emphasizes that a four-year degree is not the only path to success and highlights the importance of community colleges, apprenticeships, and vocational training. The Biden Administration's Investing in America agenda aims to create jobs in industries like clean energy and manufacturing, and the speaker announces two new initiatives: Workforce Hubs in five cities and collaboration with organizations to expand training opportunities in advanced manufacturing. She calls for collaboration between government, educators, and employers to bridge the gap between learning and earning and rebuild the nation's infrastructure. The goal is to provide students with affordable education and training that prepares them for high-demand careers. The speaker concludes by urging the audience to join the workforce initiatives and help transform the American workforce.
