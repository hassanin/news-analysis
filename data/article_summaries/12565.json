The United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) have released a report on the use of chemical weapons in Syria. The report confirms that the Syrian regime used industrial chlorine as a weapon against its own people in 2014 and 2015. It also reveals a third incident where chlorine was used, providing details about the regime elements responsible. The report calls for accountability for those involved in these attacks. The United States condemns the Syrian regime's use of chemical weapons and its violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and UN Security Council Resolution 2118. The US is working with international partners to enforce accountability through diplomatic mechanisms. Russia and Iran, which support the Syrian regime, are urged to support these efforts. The report also highlights that Russian support enables the Syrian regime to continue its military campaign against its own people in violation of international law. The international community must send a strong signal against the use of weapons of mass destruction.
