In July 2009, the White House released a readout of a phone call between President Obama and Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. The call took place at 3:15 in the afternoon, and the discussion was positive. The President informed Gates about his conversation with Sergeant Crowley and his statement to the media. Additionally, the President extended an invitation to Gates to join him and Sgt. Crowley at the White House in the near future.
