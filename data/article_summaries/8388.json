President Biden held a meeting in the Oval Office to discuss improving government services for American citizens. He shared a personal anecdote about a friend and emphasized the need for people to understand how government functions. He then signed an executive order directing 17 agencies to focus on making it easier for people to apply for services and benefits. Examples of improvements include applying for Social Security benefits online, updating address information in one place, and improving technology at airports. President Biden believes these changes will restore faith in government.
