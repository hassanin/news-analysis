President Trump announced a massive expansion in the testing capability for COVID-19, stating that the United States has conducted more tests than any other country. The plan includes distributing 150 million rapid point-of-care tests from Abbott Laboratories in the coming weeks. Fifty million tests will go to vulnerable communities, including nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and hospice care agencies. One hundred million tests will be given to states and territories to support the reopening of their economies and schools. The Abbott rapid tests are easy to use and provide results within 15 minutes without the need for additional equipment. The tests will be distributed to governors, who will have the flexibility to use them as they see fit. The goal is to use testing to protect high-risk communities and enable healthy Americans to go back to work. The President also highlighted the progress in testing capacity and the decline in hospitalizations and fatality rates. He expressed confidence in defeating the virus and ending the pandemic with the development and distribution of a safe and effective vaccine. Vice President Pence and other officials praised the public-private partnership and the efforts to increase testing capacity. They emphasized the importance of using the tests to open and keep schools open. Dr. Atlas stated that the testing advancements will help protect vulnerable populations and reduce fear surrounding the virus. The President concluded by reiterating that the country is rounding the corner on the pandemic and that vaccines are on the horizon.
