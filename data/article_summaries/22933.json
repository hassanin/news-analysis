Ron Pollack, Executive Director of the health consumer organization Families USA, has issued a statement in response to President Obama's fiscal policy speech. Pollack commends the President for offering a balanced framework for achieving a responsible budget, in contrast to the proposal put forth by House Republicans. He highlights the President's focus on moderating healthcare costs, in contrast to the House Republican proposal, which shifts costs onto those least able to bear them. Pollack specifically mentions the differences in how the President and House Republicans treat Medicare and Medicaid. The President's proposal aims to make healthcare, including Medicare and Medicaid, more efficient and effective. On the other hand, the House Republican proposal shifts Medicaid costs onto the states, which Pollack believes will lead to increased burdens on seniors, people with disabilities, and low-income children. In terms of Medicare, Pollack argues that the House Republican proposal will result in higher out-of-pocket spending for seniors. Overall, Pollack expresses appreciation for the President's approach and the directions outlined in his proposal.
