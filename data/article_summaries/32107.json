The White House officials have issued statements in response to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's release of the official 2018 mortality statistics, which show a decline in drug overdose deaths for the first time in 29 years. They view this as a sign of progress resulting from the administration's prioritization of the issue, investments made, and a whole-of-government approach. While acknowledging that there are still too many Americans dying from drug overdoses, they believe that this decline means fewer parents burying their children, fewer friends mourning loved ones, and fewer communities suffering. The Office of National Drug Control Policy Director, Jim Carroll, expressed his satisfaction with this news, while Senior Counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway, emphasized the Trump Administration's leadership in combating the drug crisis and the significance of the decline in drug overdose deaths after nearly three decades.
