President Biden has announced his intention to appoint Indiana Governor Eric J. Holcomb and New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham to the Council of Governors for two-year terms. The Council of Governors is a bipartisan group of 10 governors that facilitates coordination between the federal government and state governments on issues related to preparedness, resilience, and response to threats to homeland security. It serves as a forum for communication and collaboration on matters such as homeland defense, civil support, and the National Guard. This year, the Council will discuss supply chain resiliency and Federal-State cooperation to mitigate risks to defense critical infrastructure. The Council includes leaders from the federal government, such as the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security. Governor Holcomb and Governor Lujan Grisham will replace Oregon Governor Kate Brown and Tennessee Governor Bill Lee on the Council. They will join eight other members who were appointed by President Biden in July 2021. Governor Holcomb is the 51st Governor of Indiana and has focused on strengthening the state's economy and improving infrastructure, education, and public health. Governor Lujan Grisham is the thirty-second governor of New Mexico and has implemented policies to transform the state's education system and expand its economy. She has also prioritized environmental preservation and economic diversification. The Council of Governors was established in 2010 and focuses on matters of homeland security, defense, and military activities. Federal-State cooperation is crucial in addressing the evolving challenges and threats facing the country.
