The White House has announced nearly $10 million in funding awards from the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and Agriculture to expand access to affordable, reliable, and high-speed internet services for Native American Tribal Nations. These funds will be used to connect Tribal communities, provide laptops and tablets to Tribal members, support broadband projects, and stimulate economic growth. In addition to these funding awards, the recently passed Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides a total of $65 billion, including $2 billion specifically for Tribal communities, to deploy broadband infrastructure across the country. The law also includes provisions for low-cost broadband options, subsidies for low-income consumers, support for digital equity and inclusion plans, and improved consumer understanding of broadband plans. The Economic Development Agency is awarding $3.2 million to the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe in Colorado to construct broadband infrastructure, while the National Telecommunications and Information Administration is making awards for feasibility and planning studies for the Yavapai-Apache Nation in Arizona and the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians in Wisconsin. The Treasury Department is awarding funds to the Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma, the Kashia Band of Pomo Indians of the Stewarts Point Rancheria in California, and the Rampart Village of Alaska for various projects, including purchasing laptops or tablets, outfitting community rooms for internet access, and funding the construction of a multi-purpose building. The USDA has also awarded over $4.6 million to fund broadband infrastructure on Tribal lands in Iowa, Arizona, New Mexico, and Alaska, with each award recipient providing two years of free internet access at a local community center.
