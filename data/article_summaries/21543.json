The White House has announced new executive actions aimed at reducing gun violence and making communities safer. These actions include strengthening background checks, improving the background check system, increasing mental health treatment and reporting to the background check system, and promoting the development of gun safety technology. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) will clarify that anyone engaged in the business of selling firearms must get a license and conduct background checks, regardless of where they conduct their business. The ATF is also finalizing a rule to require background checks for people trying to buy dangerous weapons and other items through a trust, corporation, or other legal entity. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) will hire more staff to process background checks and improve the notification system for local authorities when prohibited persons try to buy a gun. The administration is also calling on Congress to support funding for additional ATF agents and investigators and a $500 million investment in mental health care. The Departments of Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security have been directed to conduct or sponsor research into gun safety technology and explore ways to promote its use and development. The administration is also urging states, local governments, and private-sector leaders to take action to reduce gun violence.
