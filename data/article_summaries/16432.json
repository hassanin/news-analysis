The article discusses a Presidential Memorandum signed by the President to implement the executive order "Classified National Security Information." The order aims to reform the security classification and declassification processes while promoting openness and transparency in the government. The President expects measurable progress in achieving these goals and will closely monitor the results. The National Security Advisor, in cooperation with the Public Interest Declassification Board, will undertake a study to design a more fundamental transformation of the security classification system. The memorandum directs various actions, including the implementation efforts of departments and agencies, the declassification of records of permanent historical value, the limited delegation of original classification authority, and the promotion of new technologies to support declassification. The Archivist of the United States is authorized to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
