Secretary of Defense Austin has granted Cameron Kinley's request to pursue a career in the National Football League (NFL) before serving as a naval officer. It is believed that Kinley, a former standout athlete and class president at the Naval Academy, will represent the Navy well in the NFL. Once his football career is over, he will continue to serve as an officer in the United States Navy.
