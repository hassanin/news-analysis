This article is a presidential proclamation by Barack Obama on June 30, 2016. The proclamation is about implementing the World Trade Organization (WTO) Declaration on the Expansion of Trade in Information Technology Products. It states that certain duties on information and communication technology products will be eliminated. The proclamation also modifies the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) to reflect these changes. Additionally, it extends duty-free treatment for certain products under the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015 and the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). The proclamation also designates certain articles as eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and AGOA. It limits the application of duty-free treatment for certain articles from beneficiary developing countries and waives competitive need limitations for certain eligible articles. The proclamation supersedes any previous proclamations or executive orders that are inconsistent with its actions.
