The article is a letter from President Barack Obama to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate. In the letter, Obama reports that he has issued an Executive Order that takes additional steps to address the Government of Syria's escalation of violence against its people. The order blocks the property and interests in property of senior officials of the Syrian government, as well as agencies or instrumentalities owned or controlled by the government. It also provides criteria for designations and blocking of property for persons who have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided support to individuals whose property is blocked. Obama delegates the authority to the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to take necessary actions to carry out the order and determine when the blocking of property is no longer warranted. The order was effective on May 18, 2011, and all executive agencies of the United States Government are directed to carry out its provisions.
