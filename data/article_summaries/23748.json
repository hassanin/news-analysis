The article is a press release from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, dated December 11, 2009. It discusses President Obama's approval of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act passed by the House of Representatives. The President applauds the passage of the legislation and views it as an important step towards comprehensive financial reform. He urges the Senate to work on similar legislation and calls on both chambers of Congress to approve the necessary reform as soon as possible for the benefit of the American people. The President expresses his eagerness to sign a strong law that establishes clear rules and ensures compliance, closes legal loopholes that allowed Wall Street firms and other credit entities to exploit the system and evade responsibility, protects consumers and investors against predatory lending and deceptive financial practices, and gives the government the necessary tools to prevent any institution from endangering the entire system or burdening the American taxpayer with collateral damage in the event of future problems. The President emphasizes that the financial crisis was not only caused by Wall Street but also by Washington, and stresses the importance of learning from this crisis and implementing reforms that promote sound investments, encourage real competitiveness and innovation, and prevent such a crisis from happening again.
