This presidential memorandum extends the use of the National Guard to respond to COVID-19 and facilitate economic recovery. It emphasizes the need for cooperation between the federal government and states in addressing the threat of COVID-19. The memorandum terminates the 100% federal cost share for National Guard forces in certain states and territories on August 21, 2020, but establishes a 75% federal cost share for emergency assistance activities related to COVID-19 response. This cost share will be available for orders authorizing duty through December 31, 2020. The memorandum also includes general provisions regarding implementation and does not create any enforceable rights or benefits. The Secretary of Defense is instructed to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
