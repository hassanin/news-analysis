Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at a gathering to address gun violence in the United States. She thanked President Joe Biden for his leadership on the issue and acknowledged the efforts of survivors, advocates, and young leaders. Harris emphasized the need for a safe society where people can go about their daily lives without fear of gun violence. She shared stories of students who have experienced active-shooter drills and highlighted the disproportionate impact of gun violence on Black and Latino communities. Harris stressed the urgency of taking action and debunked the notion that supporting the Second Amendment and enacting gun safety laws are mutually exclusive. She expressed admiration for the students leading the movement against gun violence and announced the establishment of a new office to strengthen the coalition of survivors, advocates, students, teachers, and elected leaders. Representative Maxwell Frost, a prominent advocate and the first Gen Z member of Congress, was introduced as a national leader on this issue.
