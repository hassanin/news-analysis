President Obama has announced two steps to provide housing relief to veterans, servicemembers, and responsible homeowners. The first step involves major servicers providing relief to servicemembers and veterans who were wrongfully foreclosed upon or denied lower interest rates on their mortgages. This includes conducting a review of every servicemember foreclosed upon since 2006 and providing compensation, refunding money lost due to wrongful denial of lower interest rates, providing relief for servicemembers forced to sell their homes for less than the amount owed, paying into the Veterans Affairs fund, and extending certain foreclosure protections. The second step involves reducing fees for FHA borrowers seeking to refinance, allowing them to save about a thousand dollars a year. These steps are part of the President's overall strategy to support responsible homeowners and the housing recovery.
