President Biden's Investing in America tour has begun with a visit to a semiconductor manufacturing facility in Durham, North Carolina. During the visit, President Biden announced that private companies have made over $435 billion in major domestic investments since the start of his administration, creating jobs across the country. The tour will continue for three weeks and will involve President Biden, Vice President Harris, First Lady Jill Biden, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, members of the Cabinet, and senior White House officials traveling to more than 20 states to highlight the impact of the President's economic agenda. The investments made under President Biden's agenda, including the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the American Rescue Plan, have led to a manufacturing and clean energy boom, strengthened supply chains, and the fastest jobs recovery in almost 40 years. The local coverage of President Biden's investments across the country highlights specific projects and initiatives in each state, such as the manufacturing of chips for electric vehicles in North Carolina, investments in clean energy in Minnesota, and funding for infrastructure and high-speed internet access in various states.
