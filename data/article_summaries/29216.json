On October 27, 2006, President Trump declared a national emergency with respect to the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and ordered measures to block the property of certain individuals contributing to the conflict in the country. The President took this action due to the widespread violence and atrocities in the DRC, which pose a threat to regional stability and the foreign policy of the United States. The President further addressed this national emergency in a 2014 Executive Order. The situation in the DRC continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States, and therefore, the national emergency and related measures must continue beyond October 27, 2017. As a result, the President is continuing the national emergency for one year in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
