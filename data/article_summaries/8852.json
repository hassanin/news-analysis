On November 12, 2020, President Biden declared a national emergency through Executive Order 13959, citing the threat posed by securities investments that finance certain Chinese companies. The President found that China is using US capital to support its military, intelligence, and security apparatuses, which directly threatens the US homeland and forces overseas. The national emergency was further expanded on June 3, 2021, through Executive Order 14032, addressing the involvement of China's military-industrial complex in research and development programs, weapons production, and the use of Chinese surveillance technology. The national emergency, initially declared in 2020 and expanded in 2021, will continue beyond November 12, 2021, as it is deemed necessary to address the threats to national security, foreign policy, and the US economy.
