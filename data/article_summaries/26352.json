In this proclamation, President Donald J. Trump declares July 15 through July 21, 2018, as Captive Nations Week. He emphasizes the fundamental principle upon which America was founded - that all men and women are created equal and have inherent dignity that should be valued, respected, and protected by the government. The proclamation acknowledges that while the United States enjoys rights and privileges, many people around the world continue to live under oppressive and despotic governments. The United States stands in solidarity with those suffering under such regimes and encourages them to turn away from authoritarianism and respect individual rights. The proclamation also references the history of Captive Nations Week, which was first proclaimed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1959 during the Cold War. It concludes by calling upon all Americans to reaffirm their commitment to liberty, justice, and the rule of law for those striving for these ideals around the world.
