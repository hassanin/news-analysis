The White House issued a memorandum on April 13, 2009, titled "Promoting Democracy and Human Rights in Cuba." The memo states that promoting democracy and human rights in Cuba is in the national interest of the United States and is a key component of its foreign policy in the Americas. The memo directs the Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, and Secretary of Commerce to take various actions to achieve these goals, including lifting restrictions on travel-related transactions for visits to family members in Cuba, removing restrictions on remittances to family members in Cuba, authorizing telecommunications network providers to establish facilities linking the United States and Cuba, and licensing U.S. telecommunications service providers to operate under roaming service agreements with Cuba's telecommunications service providers. The memo also authorizes the export or reexport of personal communications devices to Cuba, expands the scope of humanitarian donations eligible for export, and increases the value limit on non-food items included in gift parcel donations.
