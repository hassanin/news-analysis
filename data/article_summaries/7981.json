President Biden is signing an executive order to make environmental justice part of every federal agency's mission. The order aims to improve air and water quality, reduce the risk of asthma and cancer, and provide better access to safe housing and transportation for communities across the country. The President's climate and environmental justice agenda stands in contrast to the proposals put forth by House Republicans, which are seen as dangerous and harmful. Speaker McCarthy's plan would repeal green energy tax credits, make it easier for oil companies to use toxic chemicals, and weaken the Clean Air Act. The President opposes these proposals and will not allow them to pass. The article also mentions the President's budget and his commitment to veterans' care, as well as upcoming events and meetings on the President's schedule.
