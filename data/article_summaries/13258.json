The United States is disappointed with the Rwandan constitutional referendum that was called on short notice to amend the constitution and introduce exceptions to term limits. While acknowledging the peaceful exercise of civic rights by the people of Rwanda, the US regrets the lack of time and opportunity for political debate on the proposed provisions. The US is concerned about the restrictions on peaceful assembly, association, and free expression in Rwanda and urges the government to enable the full exercise of these fundamental freedoms. The US emphasizes that the peaceful transfer of power is important for stable democracies and encourages President Kagame to honor his commitment to term limits, which would establish a credible foundation for democracy in Rwanda and set a positive example for the region and the world. The US remains committed to supporting the people of Rwanda in their pursuit of a strong, stable, democratic, and prosperous future.
