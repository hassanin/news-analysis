The President's statement marks the 45th anniversary of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The NPT has been successful in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Global nuclear stockpiles are now at their lowest levels since the 1950s. The United States is committed to a world without nuclear weapons and encourages all states to strengthen the NPT. The statement also emphasizes the importance of preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and working for full compliance with the NPT. The United States is committed to non-proliferation and is working with its partners to reach a diplomatic agreement with Iran to prevent it from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The United States has reduced the role of nuclear weapons in its security and has reduced the size of its arsenal. The statement also highlights the importance of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in ensuring the safe and peaceful use of nuclear energy. The United States is ready to work with other NPT Parties to achieve a successful outcome at the Ninth Review Conference of the NPT.
