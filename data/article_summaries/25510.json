The United States has delivered two million doses of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to Brazil as a demonstration of solidarity in the fight against the coronavirus. The US will also be sending 1,000 ventilators to Brazil. HCQ will be used as a prophylactic to protect healthcare professionals and as a therapeutic to treat infected individuals. The two countries have also announced a joint research effort to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HCQ through randomized controlled clinical trials. The United States and Brazil will continue to work together to combat the pandemic, limit the spread of the virus, develop a vaccine, and save lives.
