President Donald Trump has transmitted a social security totalization agreement with Slovenia, along with an accompanying administrative arrangement, to Congress. These agreements were signed in January 2017 and are similar to social security agreements already in force with other countries. The purpose of these bilateral agreements is to coordinate social security systems, eliminate dual coverage and taxation, and prevent the loss of benefit protection for workers who divide their careers between two countries. The agreements contain all provisions mandated by the Social Security Act and have been deemed to be in the national interest of the United States. A report on the estimated number of individuals affected by the agreements and their cost effect has also been provided to Congress.
