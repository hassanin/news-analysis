On November 14, 1994, President Biden declared a national emergency regarding the threat posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and their means of delivery. This national emergency was further amended in 1998 and 2005 to address the worldwide threat of weapons of mass destruction proliferation activities. The President states that the continued proliferation of such weapons and delivery systems still poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. Therefore, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act, the President is continuing the national emergency for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
