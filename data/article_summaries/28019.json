Second Lady Karen Pence held a call with the Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) to learn about their work in veteran suicide prevention. The VCL provides 24/7, 365 days a year suicide prevention and crisis intervention services to veterans, military service members, and their family members. Mrs. Pence spoke directly with responders about their experiences in taking calls from veterans contemplating suicide and thanked them for their important service. The call also discussed the VCL's outreach programs, partnerships with community leaders and nonprofit organizations, and employee wellness program. Mrs. Pence, as the Lead Ambassador for PREVENTS, shared more about the PREVENTS taskforce and their national health campaign called REACH, which aims to empower veterans and all Americans in preventing suicide. On average, 20 veterans die by suicide each day, and Mrs. Pence emphasized the need to support veterans experiencing suicidal thoughts and eliminate the stigma surrounding mental health.
