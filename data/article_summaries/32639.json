President Trump has issued an executive order to strengthen retirement security in America, particularly for small-business employees. The order aims to provide easier ways for these employees to achieve greater retirement savings. Currently, large employers offer low-cost, private retirement accounts to their workers, but many small businesses do not have the resources to establish and maintain such plans. The executive order directs the administration to identify policies that would assist small- and mid-sized businesses in sponsoring workplace retirement plans by forming groups or associations of employers. These plans would provide small-business employees with access to the same quality 401(k) plans as workers at larger companies. The goal is to level the playing field for small businesses and ensure that their employees have the opportunity to prepare for a financially secure retirement.
