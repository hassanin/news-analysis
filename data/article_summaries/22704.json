President Obama has established a Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience to advise the Administration on how to respond to the impacts of climate change. The Task Force members include state, local, and tribal leaders who will use their experiences to inform their recommendations to the Administration. The President has signed an Executive Order that directs Federal agencies to take steps to make it easier for communities to strengthen their resilience to extreme weather and prepare for other impacts of climate change. The Task Force will provide recommendations on removing barriers to resilient investments, modernizing Federal grant and loan programs, and developing the information and tools needed to prepare. The Executive Order also directs agencies to modernize Federal programs, manage lands and waters for climate resilience, provide information and tools for climate change preparedness, and plan for climate change related risk. An interagency Council on Climate Preparedness and Resilience has been established to implement these actions.
