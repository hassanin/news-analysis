The Council of Economic Advisers has released a report on the relationship between the corporate tax rate and GDP growth. The report argues that the recent disconnect between real wages and corporate profits in the US is due to a lack of capital accumulation, which has been hindered by outdated tax policies and heavy regulation. The report explores the impact of reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% and implementing immediate full expensing of non-structure investments on American workers. The findings suggest that these changes would increase GDP by 3 to 5 percent. Additionally, the average household income would increase by $4,000. These estimates are consistent with other studies that also predict a boost to GDP from corporate tax reductions.
