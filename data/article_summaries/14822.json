President Obama has announced a major initiative to invest in biofuels in order to enhance America's energy security and reduce dependence on foreign oil. The U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Energy, and Navy will partner with the private sector to produce advanced drop-in aviation and marine biofuels for military and commercial transportation. The initiative aims to accelerate the production of bio-based jet and diesel fuel by constructing or retrofitting biofuel plants and refineries. The three departments will invest up to $510 million over the next three years, with private industry providing at least a one to one match in cost sharing. The initiative is part of the Administration's efforts to strengthen rural America, create jobs, and improve energy security.
