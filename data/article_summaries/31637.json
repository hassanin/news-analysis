On April 12, 2010, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency regarding the security situation and violence in Somalia, as well as acts of piracy and armed robbery off the coast of Somalia. This declaration was made under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. In 2012, the President issued an executive order to address the national emergency, specifically focusing on exports of charcoal, misappropriation of Somali public assets, and acts of violence against civilians. The President states that the situation in Somalia continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, therefore, the national emergency declared in 2010 will continue for another year. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
