During a teleconference, Jeff Zients, the White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator, announced several actions being taken to address the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. He acknowledged the grim milestone of half a million deaths from COVID-19 and emphasized the administration's commitment to using every resource to defeat the virus. One action being taken is the distribution of millions of masks to food banks and community health centers across the country, particularly in hard-hit and hard-to-reach communities. The masks will be available at no cost and will be well-fitting cloth masks that can be washed for reuse. Zients also provided updates on vaccine supply, stating that vaccine allocations to states have increased nearly 70% during the Biden-Harris administration. He highlighted the Retail Pharmacy Program, which has performed well and will see an increase in allocation to 2.1 million doses. The federal government is also mobilizing teams to administer vaccines and creating more places for people to get vaccinated. Additionally, Zients mentioned the pending approval of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and stated that if authorized, 3 to 4 million doses will be allocated next week. The administration is working with the company to accelerate the delivery of the full 100 million doses required by the end of June. Dr. Walensky, the Director of the CDC, provided updates on the state of the pandemic, including a decline in average daily cases and hospital admissions. She also discussed the National COVID-19 Vaccine Forum, which brought together thousands of participants to share information and promising practices related to vaccination efforts. Dr. Fauci addressed the issue of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, also known as long COVID or PASC. He highlighted ongoing research efforts to better understand and address this syndrome.
