President Joe Biden has issued an executive order to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in previous executive orders. The order prohibits new investment in the Russian Federation by a United States person, the exportation of certain services to persons in Russia, and the approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee of transactions by United States persons that would be prohibited under this order if performed by a United States person or within the United States. The order also prohibits transactions that evade or avoid the prohibitions set forth in this order and any conspiracy formed to violate these prohibitions. The order does not apply to transactions for the conduct of the official business of the Federal Government or the United Nations. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to take necessary actions to carry out the purposes of this order. The order does not impair the authority granted by law to executive departments or agencies, or the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. It is implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations, and does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities. The order was issued on April 6, 2022.
