In this letter, President Barack Obama informs the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate that he is terminating the suspensions under section 902(a)(3) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991. This termination applies to the issuance of temporary munitions export licenses for exports to the People's Republic of China, specifically for the C-130 cargo aircraft to be used in oil spill response operations at sea. However, it is important to note that license requirements for these exports still remain in place and will be subject to review and approval by the United States Government on a case-by-case basis.
