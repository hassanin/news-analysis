President Biden has announced a historic release of 1 million barrels per day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for six months. This will be coordinated with other countries releasing tens of millions of additional barrels on the market. The International Energy Agency has also announced a collective release with member countries outside of the United States releasing an additional 60 million barrels. Together, with the United States' commitment, this will add a combined global amount of 240 million barrels. This is the largest release from both the United States and other IEA countries in history and is aimed at supporting American consumers and the global economy. The announcement is a result of President Biden's focus on helping American families who are paying more for gas due to Putin's actions in Ukraine. Gas prices have increased by nearly a dollar per gallon since Putin's military build-up around Ukraine, as less oil is reaching the market. The reduction in supply has raised prices at the pump for Americans. The administration will continue to take actions to increase supply in the short term while also working with the international community to achieve energy independence and bolster the clean energy economy.
