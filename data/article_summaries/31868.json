President Trump welcomed four families affected by Obamacare to the White House for a listening session. The families shared stories of high premiums, denied access, restrictions, and low reimbursement rates. One family was denied coverage for their infant, another experienced a 200% rate increase on deductibles, a third family had difficulty with continuity of healthcare for their child with a medical condition, and the fourth family's insurance plan for their child with a rare genetic condition was continually replaced with more expensive policies. President Trump reaffirmed his commitment to repealing and replacing Obamacare.
