President Trump has announced plans to impose tariffs on $50 billion worth of imports from China in an effort to encourage them to change unfair trade practices related to technology and innovation. In response, China has decided to raise tariffs on $50 billion worth of United States exports. President Trump believes that China has no intention of changing its unfair practices and is instead threatening US companies, workers, and farmers. He believes that China is determined to keep the US at a permanent and unfair disadvantage, which is reflected in the massive trade imbalance between the two countries. As a result, President Trump has directed the United States Trade Representative to identify an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese goods for tariffs at a rate of 10 percent. If China continues to refuse to change its practices, the tariffs will go into effect. President Trump emphasizes the need for a more equitable trade relationship with China and states that the US will no longer be taken advantage of on trade.
