On March 11, 2020, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation to suspend and limit the entry of individuals who were physically present in the Schengen Area of Europe during the 14-day period prior to their entry into the United States. This action was taken due to the sustained person-to-person transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in multiple countries within the Schengen Area. The Schengen Area includes 26 European states and has the largest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases outside of China. The potential for undetected transmission of the virus by individuals traveling from the Schengen Area poses a threat to the security of the US transportation system, infrastructure, and national security. The proclamation provides exceptions for US citizens and lawful permanent residents, as well as certain family members, government officials, and individuals traveling for specific purposes related to containment or mitigation of the virus. The proclamation is effective from March 13, 2020, and will remain in effect until terminated by the President.
