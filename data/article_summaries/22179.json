The article discusses excerpts from a speech delivered by the President of the United States regarding the country's strategy to combat the terrorist group ISIL (also known as ISIS). The President announces that America will lead a broad coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. However, he emphasizes that this effort will be different from previous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as it will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil. Instead, the strategy will focus on using air power and supporting partner forces on the ground to take out ISIL wherever they exist. The President mentions that this approach has been successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years.
