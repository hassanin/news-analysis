The White House hosted a second virtual convening to assist cities in delivering emergency rental assistance and preventing evictions. The event highlighted actions taken by cities since the first summit on June 30th and aimed to ensure that state and local governments disburse the over $46 billion in Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) to households in need. The Treasury released data showing that over $1.5 billion in assistance was provided to eligible households in June, surpassing the total of the previous three reporting periods combined. The number of households served in June increased by 85% compared to the previous month and nearly tripled since April. The convening featured discussions on best practices, case studies, and strategies for outreach, community engagement, and landlord involvement. Public officials, including White House American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling, emphasized the commitment of the Biden-Harris Administration to ensure relief for renters and landlords as the CDC's eviction moratorium ends on July 31st. This convening builds upon the June 30th White House Eviction Prevention Summit, where teams from 46 cities committed to taking swift action to prevent evictions in their jurisdictions.
