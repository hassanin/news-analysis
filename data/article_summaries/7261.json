President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed the week of August 8 through August 14, 2021, as National Health Center Week. This proclamation recognizes the importance of federally-supported health centers and their role in providing high-quality, affordable, and accessible primary health care services to approximately 29 million Americans each year. Health centers integrate medical, dental, and behavioral health care services and play a critical role in reducing health disparities in the United States, particularly among underserved populations. They have also been vital in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic by offering testing, treatment, prevention services, and administering vaccines. President Biden emphasizes his commitment to expanding health centers and ensuring that all Americans have access to quality and affordable health care. He has invested over $7.6 billion to support health centers' COVID-19 response and improve health care services, and plans to double the Federal investment in community health centers to further expand access to care and promote health equity. During National Health Center Week, the dedication and service of health center staff are acknowledged and celebrated as they heal and strengthen local communities. President Biden aims to bring about a stronger and healthier nation for all as the country rebuilds.
