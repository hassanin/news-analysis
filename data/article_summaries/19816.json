This memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama in June 2014, addresses the issue of student loan debt in the United States. The memorandum acknowledges that college education is an important investment but is becoming increasingly unaffordable for low- and middle-income families. It highlights the need for effective strategies to help struggling borrowers manage their debt.

The memorandum directs the Secretary of Education to propose regulations that would expand the President's Pay As You Earn Plan to allow more Federal Direct Loan borrowers to cap their loan payments at 10 percent of their income. The goal is to target this option to borrowers who would otherwise struggle to repay their loans.

The memorandum also emphasizes the importance of improving communication strategies to reach vulnerable borrowers and provide them with information about repayment options. The Secretary of Education is instructed to develop and implement new targeted strategies, incorporating data analytics to evaluate and improve these efforts.

Another focus of the memorandum is to promote collaboration between the Departments of Education and Treasury to educate borrowers about income-based repayment plans during the tax filing season. The Secretaries are encouraged to invite private-sector entities to participate in partnerships to better inform borrowers about their options.

Additionally, the memorandum calls for the development of a pilot project to test the effectiveness of loan counseling resources and to collaborate with organizations representing various professions to provide more customized resources to borrowers.

The memorandum concludes with general provisions, emphasizing that it does not impair existing agency authority or create any enforceable rights or benefits. It authorizes the Secretary of Education to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
