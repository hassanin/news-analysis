President Biden's comprehensive COVID-19 strategy has led to a significant decrease in daily COVID-19 deaths, with a 90 percent reduction since he took office. The administration has focused on a historic vaccination program, with 220 million Americans fully vaccinated and over 100 million receiving a booster shot. The next step in the vaccination campaign is to consider authorizing and recommending COVID-19 vaccines for children under the age of 5. If approved, this would be a significant milestone in the fight against the virus, making nearly every American eligible for vaccination.

The Biden Administration has announced an operational plan to ensure the availability of vaccines for young children and to educate families about the benefits of vaccinating their children. The plan acknowledges that many parents will choose to have their kids vaccinated through their pediatrician or primary care doctor. State and local governments, healthcare providers, pharmacies, and community-based organizations will play a critical role in the success of this effort. Trusted messengers, such as pediatricians, will also be involved in providing information and answering questions from families.

The administration is preparing for different scenarios, including the possibility of starting vaccinations for young children as early as the week of June 20th. The plan includes securing a significant supply of vaccines, making vaccinations available in convenient locations, leveraging federal programs to reach parents, and supporting education and engagement efforts to build trust among parents and families. A national public education campaign will be launched, and trusted experts will provide information through platforms like the "What to Expect" blog series.

Overall, the Biden Administration is focused on ensuring that vaccines are readily available for young children and that families have the necessary information to make informed choices about vaccination.
