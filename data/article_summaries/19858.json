First Lady Michelle Obama will be visiting the Children's National Health System in Washington, DC on December 12th. She will be joined by television and radio host Ryan Seacrest. They will tour the facility, visit with patients and their families, and read holiday stories to children. They will also participate in a broadcast from the hospital's atrium, which is home to the Ryan Seacrest Foundation's Seacrest Studios. This tradition of visiting the Children's National Health System dates back to Bess Truman.
