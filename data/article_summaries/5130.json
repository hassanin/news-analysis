President Biden has made significant efforts to secure the US-Mexico border and rebuild a more orderly and humane immigration system that was negatively affected by the previous administration. In the past two years, his administration has allocated more resources for border security than any previous president, deployed over 23,000 agents to address border issues, prevented large quantities of illicit fentanyl from entering the country, and collaborated with world leaders to tackle migration challenges in the Western Hemisphere. Additionally, the administration has implemented new measures to enhance border security, decrease unlawful crossings, and expand legal pathways for individuals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The president's budget includes substantial funding to maintain border security, enforce immigration laws, modernize border facilities, invest in technology, ensure the well-being of migrants in DHS custody, and reduce the backlog of immigration cases. President Biden is committed to implementing real solutions to fix the broken immigration system, while some Congressional Republicans are accused of obstructing progress for political gain.
