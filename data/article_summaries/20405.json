The White House has released a memorandum identifying countries as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries for Fiscal Year 2016. The countries identified include Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. This list is not a reflection of a country's counternarcotics efforts or level of cooperation with the United States. The determination is based on the combination of geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced in these countries. Bolivia, Burma, and Venezuela are designated as countries that have failed to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements. The determination also emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and certain countries of concern to the United States in drug-control policies and programs. The memorandum also highlights the global challenges of the drug trade, including illegal poppy cultivation in Afghanistan, illegal drug activity in China, and drug trafficking in Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America. The memorandum acknowledges the efforts of countries such as Peru and Colombia in countering illegal drug trafficking and transnational crime. The United States will continue to collaborate with partner countries to combat the drug trade and other illegal activities associated with transnational organized crime.
