First Lady Melania Trump has unveiled the recently restored Bellangé suite, a collection of furniture made for the White House in 1817 by Pierre-Antoine Bellangé. The restoration project was approved by the Committee for the Preservation of the White House after the deteriorating condition of the historic Blue Room furniture was noted in 2005. Over the past 10 years, a team of curators has been working with experts to complete the restoration. The restoration process involved using scientific and historical research to select new upholstery fabrics and replicate the original gilding based on microscopic samples taken from the original 1817 furniture. The First Lady plans to reinstate the Bellangé suite in the Blue Room in the fall of 2018.
