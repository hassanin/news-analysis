President Obama has praised the House of Representatives for passing the Home Star Energy Retrofit Act, stating that it is a common sense bill that will create jobs, save consumers money, and strengthen the economy. He specifically thanked Congressman Peter Welch for his hard work on the issue. The President believes that this legislation will help jumpstart job growth and demand for American-made products. The rebate program will not only put people back to work but also lower costs for homeowners who choose to improve their homes with energy-efficient products. Additionally, it will save consumers money on energy bills in the long run. President Obama emphasized the importance of the United States leading in clean energy technologies, stating that he will not settle for anything less than first place. He expressed confidence in the country's workers and factories being ready to support new installations and renovations for energy-efficient buildings. The President looks forward to working with the Senate to improve the legislation and ensure that more middle-class homeowners can make these investments without delay.
