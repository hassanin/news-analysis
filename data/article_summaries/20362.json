The article is a joint statement from U.S. President Obama, Russian President Medvedev, and French President Sarkozy on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. The statement reaffirms their commitment to supporting the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan in finalizing the Basic Principles for the settlement of the conflict. They instruct their mediators to present an updated version of the Madrid Document from November 2007, which outlines the Basic Principles. The Basic Principles include the return of territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control, an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh, a corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh, determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a legally binding expression of will, the right of displaced persons and refugees to return, and international security guarantees. The endorsement of these Basic Principles by Armenia and Azerbaijan will allow for the drafting of a comprehensive settlement for peace, stability, and prosperity in the region.
