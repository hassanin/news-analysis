The U.S. and the European Union have established the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) to enhance trade and investment ties and update rules for the modern economy. The TTC will have ten working groups focused on various challenges such as technology standards, supply chain security, climate technology, ICT security, data governance, and more. The inaugural TTC meeting will take place on September 29th in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and will be attended by high-level officials from both sides. The aim is to ensure that trade and technology policies benefit both economies and align with shared values.
