Vice President Kamala Harris held a meeting with Cabinet members to address the issue of maternal health in America. This is the first time any administration has prioritized this issue at the national level. The Vice President highlighted the high maternal mortality rates in the United States, particularly among Black, Native, and rural women. The discussion focused on various factors that impact maternal health, including housing, transportation, and nutrition. The administration announced initiatives such as expanding Medicaid coverage, creating a new designation for birthing-friendly hospitals, and convening the healthcare industry to improve practices. Vice President Harris commended the law enforcement officials, first responders, and civilians involved in the recent Brooklyn subway shooting and emphasized the need for a thorough investigation and appropriate consequences.
