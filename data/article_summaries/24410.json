The United Nations has adopted a resolution dedicated to advancing the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals. This is the first time in history that such a resolution has been passed. The United States supports this resolution and believes that all people, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, should be treated equally and protected from discrimination. The recognition of LGBT rights is seen as a significant milestone in the fight for equality, and it makes the world a safer and more respectful place for everyone.
