The article discusses how President Trump's regulatory rollback and tax reform are driving an economic surge that is resulting in increased wages for workers. The author argues that this surge in the economy is leading to more competition among employers for employees, which in turn is driving up wages. The author also highlights several major U.S. employers that have committed to investing in growth, giving special bonuses, or increasing wages as a result of the tax bill. The article concludes by stating that with regulatory relief, tax cuts, and increased business from economic growth, employers now have the resources to bid up wages, spreading the increases without the unintended consequences of a dramatic minimum-wage increase.
