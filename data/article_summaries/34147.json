President Donald J. Trump's first international trip as the leader of the United States is to Saudi Arabia, emphasizing the importance he places on the U.S.-Saudi relationship. This meeting with King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud marks the seventh time a U.S. president has traveled to the Middle East to meet with a Saudi king since the end of World War II. The first meeting between a U.S. president and a Saudi king occurred in 1945 when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt invited King Abdulaziz ibn Saud to join him on the USS Quincy. This meeting established a framework for future relations between the two nations and left a lasting impression on both leaders.
