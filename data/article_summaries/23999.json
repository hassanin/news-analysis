The White House has released the United States Counter Piracy and Maritime Security Action Plan, which aims to maintain safety and security at sea. The plan focuses on three core areas: prevention of attacks, response to acts of maritime crime, and enhancing maritime security and governance. It provides specific frameworks for the Horn of Africa and Gulf of Guinea regions, taking into account their varying geographic, political, and legal environments. The plan supersedes the 2008 Partnership & Action Plan for countering piracy off the Horn of Africa.
