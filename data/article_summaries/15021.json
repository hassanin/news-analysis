Vice President Joe Biden held a Middle Class Task Force event on work-family balance and announced recommendations from the Equal Pay Enforcement Task Force. The recommendations include improving interagency coordination, collecting data on the pay gap, educating employers and employees, improving the federal government's role as a model employer, and passing the Paycheck Fairness Act. The White House Council on Women and Girls also launched a Work-Flex Event Starter Kit to promote workplace flexibility at the community level. The Department of Justice, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and Department of Labor all committed to taking action to address wage discrimination and improve work-family balance.
