The press briefing began with a late start, as the FEMA Administrator was meeting with the President to provide an update on Hurricane Idalia. The administration is prepared to support any needs that arise as the hurricane moves through Florida and Georgia. The President will speak directly to the American people about the administration's efforts to respond to the hurricane and assist with the recovery from the recent wildfires in Maui.

The FEMA Administrator provided an update on Hurricane Idalia, stating that over 1,000 personnel from FEMA and other federal agencies are deployed and ready to assist. As of 7:30 a.m., there were nearly 300,000 power outages in Florida, and these numbers are expected to rise as the storm moves into Georgia. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and utility companies are pre-positioned to support power restoration efforts. The Administrator emphasized the importance of staying safe and following the guidance of local officials.

The press briefing also addressed other topics, including the potential government shutdown, the rescheduling of marijuana as a Schedule III drug, and the President's commitment to supporting workers and labor rights. The briefing concluded with questions about the President's awareness of recent events, such as the situation in Gabon and the raid on a gay wedding in Nigeria. The White House did not have specific information to provide on these topics.
