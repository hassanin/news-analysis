Vice President Kamala Harris held a roundtable with constitutional law, privacy, and technology experts to discuss the implications of overturning Roe v. Wade. They discussed the principles of liberty and self-determination, the impact on access to contraception and same-sex marriage, concerns about data privacy, the maternal health care crisis, and the connection between restrictions on reproductive rights and limitations on other rights. The Vice President called on the experts to inform the public about the potential consequences of the Supreme Court's decision.
