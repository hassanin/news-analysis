President Obama has announced new executive actions to strengthen U.S. manufacturing. U.S. manufacturing has been experiencing job growth and investment, and these actions aim to build on that momentum. The actions include investing over $300 million in emerging manufacturing technologies critical to U.S. competitiveness, providing manufacturers access to state-of-the-art facilities, expanding workforce development strategies through a $100 million apprenticeship grant competition, and launching new tools and a five-year investment to support small manufacturers in the supply chain. The executive actions align with the recommendations of the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP) report, which focuses on enabling innovation, securing the talent pipeline, and improving the business climate. The report identifies advanced materials, advanced sensors, and digital manufacturing as priority technology areas, and emphasizes the need for a skilled workforce and a supportive environment for small manufacturers. The AMP Steering Committee, a working group of the President's Council of Advisors in Science and Technology, has been instrumental in developing the AMP report.
