The Senate has passed a bipartisan bill to reauthorize and strengthen the Violence Against Women Act. This bill aims to reduce domestic violence-related homicides, improve the response to rape and sexual assault, address high rates of dating violence among young women, and provide justice for vulnerable individuals. President Obama thanks Senator Leahy and colleagues for their leadership and urges the House to pass the bill so he can sign it into law.
