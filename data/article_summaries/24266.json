The article discusses a partnership between the Peace Corps and VSO (Voluntary Service Overseas) to promote volunteerism and global development. Both organizations have a history of fighting poverty and improving the lives of marginalized communities. They will work together to leverage their resources, share knowledge, and collaborate on development interests. The partnership aims to enhance global volunteerism efforts and create lasting change. Peace Corps and VSO have informally collaborated in the past, and now they will capitalize on this joint work to increase their impact in the countries where they operate. They will focus on addressing urgent development challenges such as education, health, HIV/AIDS, youth development, gender, climate change, and citizen participation. The partnership will also promote volunteering and active citizenship, supporting countries in developing their own volunteer programs. Additionally, they will collaborate on organizational effectiveness by sharing best practices in training, systems, and innovation.
