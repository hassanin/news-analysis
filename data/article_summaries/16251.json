In this letter, President Barack Obama is asking Congress to consider amendments to the Fiscal Year 2010 proposals in his Fiscal Year 2011 Budget for the Department of Commerce. These amendments aim to reduce backlogs in processing patent applications and improve the operations of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The amendments also seek to continue efforts in administering and overseeing grants awarded under the Broadband Technology Opportunity Program. The funding for these amendments would be offset by canceling unobligated balances from within the Department of Commerce's Census Bureau for Fiscal Year 2010. The proposed budget authority for Fiscal Year 2010 in the President's Fiscal Year 2011 Budget would not be affected by these amendments.
