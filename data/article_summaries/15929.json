Congresswoman Melissa Bean from Illinois expressed her support for President Obama's tax package compromise. She believes that, considering the fragility of the economy and slow pace of recovery, it is crucial to extend tax cuts and provide certainty to the American people. Bean emphasizes that the compromise prevents taxes from increasing for working families and business owners, which she has consistently advocated for. She also believes that the plan will help boost the recovery by extending unemployment insurance and promoting business investment through targeted tax cuts.
