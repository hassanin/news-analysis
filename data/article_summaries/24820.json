The White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, issued a statement regarding the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) vote on Iran's nuclear program. The statement highlights the international community's strong unity and resolve in calling upon Iran to fulfill its international obligations and provide transparency in its nuclear program. It emphasizes the commitment to strengthen the rules of the international system and support the IAEA and UN Security Council in enforcing these rules. The statement also mentions the urgent need for Iran to address the international deficit of confidence in its intentions, as demonstrated by the overwhelming support from 25 countries. The United States has supported the Director General's proposal to provide fuel for Iran's Tehran Research Reactor, aiming to meet medical and humanitarian needs while building confidence in Iran's intentions. The United States recognizes Iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy and is willing to engage in diplomatic solutions if Iran chooses to do so. However, Iran has refused to participate in a follow-up meeting with the P5+1 countries if its nuclear program is included on the agenda. The statement concludes by stating that patience is limited, time is running out, and if Iran fails to meet its obligations, it will face growing isolation and consequences.
