President Obama will attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen on December 9. The White House announced that the President is committed to finding a global solution to climate change and is eager to work with the international community to reach a comprehensive and operational agreement. The President is prepared to put a U.S. emissions reduction target on the table, aiming for a 17% reduction below 2005 levels in 2020, and ultimately in line with final U.S. energy and climate legislation. The President's goal is to reduce emissions by 83% by 2050, which would require a 30% reduction below 2005 levels in 2025 and a 42% reduction below 2005 levels in 2030. The U.S. delegation attending the conference will include several Cabinet secretaries and top officials, who will highlight the Obama Administration's efforts to address climate change and create a new energy future. The Administration has made progress in domestic leadership, such as investing over $80 billion in clean energy through the Recovery Act, establishing efficiency standards for automobiles, and advancing comprehensive energy legislation. The Administration has also shown international leadership by launching the Major Economies Forum, eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, and forming bilateral energy and climate partnerships with countries like China and India. The U.S. is committed to phasing down HFC emissions, a potent greenhouse gas, and has proposed this under the Montreal Protocol.
