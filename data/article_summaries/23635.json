President Obama will be announcing new initiatives to increase credit to small businesses at Metropolitan Archives, a family-owned small business that recently expanded with an SBA loan. The event will have an audience of approximately 100 people, including Metropolitan Archives employees, small business owners, local political leaders, and Members of Congress. The stage participants will include Joe Incarnato and Doug Peters, co-owners of Metropolitan Archives, as well as Secretary of Treasury Tim Geithner and SBA Administrator Karen Mills. Metropolitan Archives is a family-run business that provides records management services and recently purchased their building with an SBA 504 loan, allowing them to make energy-saving upgrades and create new jobs. They are now seeking another loan to further expand their business.
