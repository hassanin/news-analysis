White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki held a briefing where she discussed several topics. She highlighted the release of state-by-state factsheets outlining the importance of passing the American Jobs Plan. The factsheets provide information on the infrastructure needs in each state and the potential benefits of the plan. Psaki also mentioned a recent settlement between SK Innovation and LG that is a positive step for the American auto industry and the supply chain for electric vehicle batteries.

Psaki addressed questions about the attack on Iran's Natanz nuclear facility and its potential impact on ongoing talks to reestablish the Iran nuclear deal. She stated that the U.S. was not involved in the attack and that the focus remains on diplomatic discussions in Vienna.

Regarding the semiconductor shortage, Psaki discussed the steps the federal government is taking, including engaging with industry and international partners. The administration has proposed major investments in semiconductor manufacturing and research and is open to ideas from Democrats and Republicans on how to address the issue.

Psaki also commented on immigration issues, such as agreements with Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala to increase border security, and the decision not to move forward with a police commission but to focus on passing the George Floyd Policing Act.

Other topics covered in the briefing include the corporate tax rate, the situation in Minnesota following an officer-involved shooting, vaccine distribution, and the President's upcoming announcement of the American Families Plan.
