In a meeting on financial reform, President Obama emphasized his willingness to work with anyone, regardless of party, but made it clear that bipartisanship should not come at the expense of loopholes and special interests. He focused on the issue of derivatives and criticized the financial industry's attempts to weaken oversight. The President stressed the need to end taxpayer bailouts and "Too Big To Fail," and insisted on including consumer protections and real independence in the final bill. He urged attendees to stop spreading misinformation and called for quick action on reform. Additionally, he emphasized the importance of providing assistance to small businesses. The President also shared a report stating that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act has created or saved approximately 2.5 million jobs so far and is on track to reach 3.5 million jobs by the end of the year.
