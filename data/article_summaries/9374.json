National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Director Chang Hojin of the Republic of Korea's National Security Office held an introductory call on January 9 to discuss the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). They expressed their strong condemnation of the DPRK's transfer of ballistic missiles to Russia and Russia's use of these missiles against Ukraine. They highlighted that this transfer and use of weapons violates United Nations Security Council resolutions, increases the suffering of the Ukrainian people, undermines the global non-proliferation regime, and poses significant security implications for Europe, the Korean Peninsula, and the Indo-Pacific region. In response to the growing cooperation between the DPRK and Russia, the officials committed to continuing close cooperation in support of Ukraine and maintaining collaboration on shared security challenges to promote peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region and globally.
