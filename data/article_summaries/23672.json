The article discusses a joint commitment by several countries, including Algeria, Armenia, Australia, Canada, and others, to enhance the security of Category 1 radioactive sources within their territories by 2016. The countries aim to secure these sources in accordance with the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. They plan to establish regulatory bodies with independent oversight functions, develop comprehensive lifecycle management plans, and assess domestic threats to create national response plans. The countries will also implement site-level security measures and provide rapid response to any unauthorized access to radioactive material. Cooperation with other states and multilateral organizations is encouraged to complete these security measures. Additionally, the countries may consider additional best practices for securing Category 1 radioactive sources, such as robust physical protection access controls, monitoring systems, enhanced delay measures, involvement of off-site response forces, and a comprehensive regulatory framework for source transportation, possession, and disposition.
