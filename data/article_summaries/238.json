Congressional Republicans, under the banner of Make America Great Again (MAGA), have recently introduced a new bill that prioritizes special interests over the needs of working families. The legislation, which has drawn criticism from opponents, is seen as a boon for big pharmaceutical companies at the expense of seniors. One of its key provisions is the elimination of Medicare's ability to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs. Critics argue that this move demonstrates the Republicans' extreme and disconnected vision for the country, which fails to address the concerns of ordinary working families nationwide.
