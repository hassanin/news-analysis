President Donald Trump has sent a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, stating his intent to suspend the duty-free treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) for certain eligible articles from Thailand. This action is being taken because Thailand has not assured the United States that it will provide equitable and reasonable access to its markets. The suspension will be effective from December 30, 2020. President Trump emphasizes that the United States is committed to fair and reciprocal trade with Thailand.
