The order states that all executive branch departments and agencies of the Federal Government will be closed on Friday, December 26, 2014, the day after Christmas Day, with employees excused from duty. However, certain offices and installations may remain open and certain employees may be required to report for duty for reasons of national security, defense, or other public need.
