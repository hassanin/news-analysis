President Obama made a statement praising Congress for passing the STOCK Act, which prohibits members of Congress from trading stocks based on nonpublic information they learn while working on Capitol Hill. He called it a good first step and urged Congress to take further action to combat the influence of money in politics and restore trust between the government and the American people.
