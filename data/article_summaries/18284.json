President Barack Obama has announced the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Burundi. The national emergency was initially declared on November 22, 2015, due to the unusual and extraordinary threat posed to the national security and foreign policy of the United States by the situation in Burundi. The situation in Burundi is characterized by violence against civilians, unrest, incitement of imminent violence, significant political repression, and a threat to the peace, security, and stability of Burundi. The national emergency will now continue in effect beyond November 22, 2016, for an additional year, as determined by the President in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. The notice of the continuation of the national emergency will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
