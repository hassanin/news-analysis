The Trump administration is urging Americans to take action in slowing the spread of the coronavirus. Vice President Mike Pence emphasizes the importance of staying home if sick, especially for the elderly and those with serious health conditions. Visiting nursing homes and long-term care facilities should be avoided unless necessary. Americans are advised to avoid unnecessary travel, restaurants, bars, public food courts, and gatherings of more than 10 people. Children should stay home from school, and those who are not in critical infrastructure jobs should work from home. Practicing good hygiene, such as frequent handwashing and disinfecting surfaces, is also crucial. These actions can have a significant impact on preventing the spread of the virus and saving lives.
