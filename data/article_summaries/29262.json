During a press briefing, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross discussed the recent action taken by the Commerce Department regarding Canadian softwood lumber. The action is the result of a longstanding dispute between the United States and Canada over the subsidies given to Canadian lumber producers. The United States has imposed countervailing duties on softwood lumber from Canada, with the duties being collected retroactively for the past 90 days. The Secretary estimated that the tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber will amount to roughly $1 billion per year. He also stated that the price of lumber for housing in the United States may increase slightly, but it is unlikely to rise by the full 20 percent tariff. The Secretary emphasized that the United States is fighting for its industries and that Canada must play by the rules. He also mentioned that the softwood lumber dispute is separate from the ongoing dispute over Canadian dairy products.
