The White House has launched a new campaign called "Lock Down Your Login" to empower Americans to better secure their online accounts. The campaign aims to move beyond simple usernames and passwords and promote the use of strong authentication, such as fingerprints or one-time codes. The National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA), along with non-profit organizations and private sector companies, will collaborate to spread awareness about the campaign. The campaign partners include Facebook, Google, Intel, Mastercard, and USAA, among others. The campaign was developed through collaboration and consumer research to create a message that resonates with Americans and encourages them to take action to secure their accounts. More information can be found on the campaign's website, www.lockdownyourlogin.com.
