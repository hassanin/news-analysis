In this statement, President Obama commends the District of Columbia, Mayor Muriel Bowser, and the Council of the District of Columbia for raising the minimum wage. He mentions that since his call to raise the wage in 2013, 18 states and D.C. have taken action to help over 7 million American workers. He also notes that nearly 50 cities and counties, as well as many businesses, have independently increased wages for thousands more workers. The President emphasizes the importance of building on this progress, stating that no American working full-time should struggle to make ends meet. He pledges to continue fighting for hardworking Americans and urges Congress to raise the federal minimum wage so that all Americans have a fair shot to get ahead.
