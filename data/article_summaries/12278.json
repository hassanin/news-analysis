This memorandum, issued by the White House on March 3, 2009, addresses the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The ESA requires federal agencies to consult with expert agencies, such as the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), before taking any action that may affect endangered or threatened species. However, a new regulation issued on December 16, 2008, expanded the circumstances in which agencies could choose not to consult with or obtain the written agreement of the FWS or NMFS. This memorandum requests the Secretaries of the Interior and Commerce to review the December 16, 2008, regulation and determine whether new rulemaking procedures should be implemented to promote the goals of the ESA. Until the review is completed, all agencies are instructed to exercise their discretion and follow the previous consultation and agreement practices involving the FWS and NMFS. The memorandum states that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
