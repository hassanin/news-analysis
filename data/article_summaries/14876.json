In this statement, President Obama extends his best wishes to those celebrating Nowruz, the Persian New Year. He addresses the people and leaders of Iran, expressing his desire for a new relationship between the two countries if Iran meets its international obligations. The President acknowledges the difficulty in overcoming decades of mistrust but emphasizes the importance of resolving the differences, particularly regarding Iran's nuclear program. He states that if Iran's nuclear program is truly peaceful, there is a basis for a practical solution that would allow Iran access to peaceful nuclear energy while addressing the world's concerns. The United States, along with the international community, is ready to reach such a solution. The President urges the Iranian government to take immediate steps to reduce tensions and work towards a long-term settlement. He highlights the benefits of greater trade and ties with other nations if a solution is found, but warns that Iran's current path will only further isolate the country. President Obama hopes that Iran's leaders will choose a better path for the sake of the Iranian people and the world, emphasizing that Iranians deserve the same freedoms and rights as people everywhere. He also mentions the potential contributions of the Iranian people in arts, sciences, and innovation, highlighting the importance of working together for a future of peace and prosperity.
