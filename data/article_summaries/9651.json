The presidents of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, along with Vice President Joe Biden, met in Washington, DC to discuss efforts to promote economic integration in the Northern Triangle of Central America. They discussed the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity, which aims to invest in human capital, provide greater opportunities for citizens, and ensure more accountable and transparent public institutions. The leaders also emphasized the need to prevent undocumented migration to the United States, promote safe and orderly migration, combat criminal networks, and repatriate migrants. The US Congress has allocated $750 million for Central America in Fiscal Year 2016, representing a significant increase in assistance. The governments of the Northern Triangle expressed their gratitude for this support and committed to implementing a comprehensive plan of action for 2016. They highlighted achievements in areas such as crime prevention, corruption fighting, job creation, and fiscal stability. The leaders agreed to continue working together on various initiatives, including awareness campaigns about the risks of undocumented migration, fighting human smuggling and trafficking, strengthening border security, and promoting economic growth. The United States also committed to aligning its programs and resources with the strategic priorities identified under the Alliance for Prosperity and participating in a High-Level Dialogue with the Northern Triangle governments.
