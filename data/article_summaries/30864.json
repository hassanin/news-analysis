The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released its monthly Employment Situation Report for December 2020, revealing that employment fell by 140,000 from November to December. This marked the end of seven consecutive months of job gains as states implemented partial economic lockdowns due to the increasing number of COVID-19 cases. The leisure and hospitality industry, which includes low-wage earners, experienced the largest job loss of 498,000. The industry has been particularly vulnerable to changes in COVID-19 prevalence, with employment falling by almost 50 percent between February and April. Although there were significant gains in the leisure and hospitality industry over the past seven months, employment in December was still only at 77 percent of its February level, while other industries reached 96 percent of their pre-pandemic levels. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 6.7 percent, representing millions of Americans who are still out of work. However, this is an improvement from the peak of 14.8 percent in April. The unemployment rate for Black Americans fell below 10 percent for the first time since February, while the rate for Hispanic Americans increased to 9.3 percent, likely due to their higher representation in the leisure and hospitality industry. Policymakers will need to closely monitor employment trends in response to the evolving dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic.
