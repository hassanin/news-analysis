President Biden will meet with President Xi of China virtually on Monday evening, November 15th. The meeting is part of the intense competition between the United States and China and aims to set the terms of the competition and avoid conflict. President Biden will discuss his approach to dealing with China, the importance of setting commonsense guardrails, and the need for China to play by the rules of the road. The leaders will also discuss areas of divergence, such as threats to the rules-based international order, unfair economic behavior, human rights practices, and China's behavior towards Taiwan and technology. They will also discuss areas of potential alignment, particularly on transnational issues like climate change and health security. The meeting is not expected to produce specific deliverables but is part of the ongoing effort to responsibly manage the competition. The leaders will have a face-to-face conversation, which is expected to be more substantive and in-depth than previous phone calls. The duration of the meeting is not specified.
