The article discusses President Obama's response to the release of Pope Francis's encyclical on climate change. Obama welcomes the encyclical and admires the Pope for advocating for action against global climate change. He emphasizes the responsibility to protect future generations from the harmful effects of climate change and expresses his commitment to bold actions to reduce carbon pollution, increase clean energy and efficiency, build resilience in vulnerable communities, and encourage responsible management of natural resources. Obama looks forward to discussing these issues with Pope Francis during his visit to the White House in September and hopes that world leaders and all individuals will reflect on the Pope's call to take care of our common home as they prepare for global climate negotiations in Paris.
