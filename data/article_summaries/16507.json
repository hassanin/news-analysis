The article discusses the passage of the Senate Republican budget and criticizes it for relying on top-down economics and gimmicks. The budget is accused of burdening the middle class, seniors, low-income children and families, and national security, while refusing to ask the wealthy to contribute to deficit reduction. The budget also locks in sequestration cuts to investments in the middle class and fails to responsibly fund national security. In contrast, the President's Budget aims to bring middle-class economics into the 21st century by investing in America's future, cutting inefficient spending, and reforming the tax code. The President's budget strengthens the middle class through investments in research, education, training, and infrastructure while ensuring Americans' safety. The article mentions that in 2013, Republicans supported the Murray-Ryan agreement, which reversed harmful sequestration cuts to both defense and non-defense equally. Senators from both parties have called for building on that approach and supporting sequester relief with spending and tax reforms. The President has made it clear that he will not accept a budget that locks in sequestration or increases funding for national security without matching increases in funding for economic security. The Administration will continue to abide by these principles.
