President Biden addressed the nation from the South Court Auditorium, providing an update on the progress of the vaccination campaign against COVID-19. He announced that the goal of administering 200 million shots in his first 100 days has been exceeded, with over 100 million shots administered in the first 60 days. However, he emphasized that the work is far from over and that the war against COVID-19 is still ongoing. He urged Americans to continue following safety precautions, such as wearing masks and social distancing. The President also announced plans to accelerate the vaccination efforts by increasing vaccine supply to states, expanding the number of vaccination sites, and providing assistance to seniors and people with disabilities to ensure they can access vaccination sites. He set a goal for at least 90 percent of adults to be eligible for vaccination by April 19th. Despite the progress made, President Biden warned that cases are rising in many places and urged everyone to continue doing their part to fight the virus.
