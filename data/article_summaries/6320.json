During National Sickle Cell Awareness Month, President Biden recognizes the challenges faced by individuals living with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and commits to developing better treatments. SCD is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders that can cause chronic pain and serious health complications. Approximately 100,000 Americans have SCD, with Black and Hispanic Americans disproportionately affected. There is no widely available cure, and treatment options like bone marrow and stem cell transplants are often inaccessible. People with SCD also face disparities in treatment, care, and access to specialized care. The Biden Administration is working to close these health disparities by collaborating with various organizations and agencies. Efforts include gathering comprehensive information on SCD patients, developing a Cell and Gene Therapy Access Model, assisting with early identification and treatment, approving new drug therapies, funding clinical trials, and researching personalized treatment approaches. The administration's "Cure Sickle Cell Initiative" aims to accelerate the development of effective and accessible genetic therapies. The proclamation encourages the public to learn more about SCD and support efforts to reduce the burden of the disease.
