This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by Barack Obama on December 20, 2016. The memorandum withdraws certain portions of the United States Arctic Outer Continental Shelf from mineral leasing. The withdrawal is based on the important values of the Chukchi Sea and portions of the Beaufort Sea for marine mammals, wildlife, wildlife habitat, scientific research, and Alaska Native subsistence use. It also considers the vulnerability of these ecosystems to an oil spill and the unique logistical, operational, safety, and scientific challenges of oil extraction and spill response in these Arctic waters. The memorandum specifies the areas that are withdrawn from leasing and states that existing leases in the withdrawn areas are not affected.
