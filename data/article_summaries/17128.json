The leaders of Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, United States, and Vietnam have announced the broad outlines of a Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. They aim to establish a comprehensive regional agreement that liberalizes trade and investment and addresses new and traditional trade issues. They believe this agreement will serve as a model for future free trade agreements, promoting economic competitiveness, benefiting consumers, creating jobs, and reducing poverty. While there are still sensitive issues to be negotiated, the leaders are committed to concluding the agreement as quickly as possible. They also express interest in expanding the partnership to other countries in the region.
