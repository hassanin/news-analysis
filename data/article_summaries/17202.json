The American Jobs Act is a proposal by President Obama to stimulate job growth and help the economy recover from the recession. It includes several measures to support small businesses, such as cutting payroll taxes and providing tax incentives for hiring new workers. The plan also aims to put workers back on the job by investing in infrastructure projects, preventing teacher layoffs, and modernizing schools. It includes reforms to the unemployment insurance system to provide greater flexibility and support for job seekers. Additionally, the plan includes tax relief for American workers and families, such as cutting payroll taxes and allowing more Americans to refinance their mortgages. The President has stated that the plan is fully paid for as part of a long-term deficit reduction plan.
