The Obama Administration is requesting $5.6 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) activities to degrade and defeat ISIL. This includes military operations as part of Operation Inherent Resolve. The request includes $1.6 billion to establish an Iraq Train and Equip Fund to support Iraqi Security Forces in their fight against ISIL. The funding will help rebuild the Iraqi Army and strengthen the capabilities of Iraqi partners. The request aligns with the strategy outlined by President Obama in his September 10 address to the nation. Despite the additional request, total OCO funding for the Department of Defense is still $20 billion less than last year, reflecting the decrease in spending as the combat mission in Afghanistan concludes. The Administration believes this request presents an opportunity for Congress and the Administration to work together and secure the resources needed to degrade and defeat ISIL.
