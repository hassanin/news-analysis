The author argues that the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) has failed by its own standards and has caused damage to the healthcare system. They emphasize the need for healthcare advocates to articulate what they are for, rather than just opposing Obamacare. The author praises President Trump for laying out a positive vision for affordable and accessible healthcare, with individual patients and families in control of their healthcare decisions. They believe that the recently introduced healthcare reform proposal in the Senate is a step towards achieving this vision. The author calls for action to undo the damage caused by Obamacare and states that now is the time to act.
