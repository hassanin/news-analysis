During a press conference on the South Lawn, President Biden stated that he has exhausted his executive authority on taking action on guns and believes it is now up to Congress to act. He expressed that the majority of Americans are against assault weapons and called for the passage of an assault weapons ban. The President mentioned that the last time such a ban was passed, violent and mass shootings decreased for several years. When asked if he would consider traveling to Nashville to meet with members of the community, Biden confirmed that he has already spoken with various officials, including the mayor, senators, and the chief of police. He expressed reluctance to travel to the area, citing his previous experience with mass shootings.
