Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the Hudson Institute about the Trump Administration's policies toward China. He stated that China is using political, economic, military, and propaganda tools to advance its influence and benefit its interests in the United States. Pence accused China of aggressive behavior, such as a recent incident where a Chinese naval vessel came close to a US ship in the South China Sea. He also mentioned China's use of "Debt Diplomacy" to expand its influence globally. Pence claimed that China is actively attempting to influence the upcoming US elections. The US has implemented tariffs on Chinese goods and wants Beijing to pursue fair and reciprocal trade policies. Pence emphasized that the US will stand firm against China's attempts to sway American politics and policy.
