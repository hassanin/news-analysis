Lisa Monaco, the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, met with New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio and New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton at the White House. They discussed ways to strengthen coordination between federal, state, and local agencies on counterterrorism issues, as well as the U.S. government's response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. They specifically discussed threats from groups such as al-Qa'ida, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and the Khorasan Group, and measures to protect the U.S. homeland from potential threats. They also reviewed the status of additional airport screening measures implemented at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport and efforts to prepare hospitals and healthcare workers to identify and treat Ebola patients safely.
