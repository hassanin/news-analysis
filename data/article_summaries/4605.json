In this article, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. expands the scope of the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14024 of April 15, 2021. He cites the Russian Federation's war against Ukraine, including its recent invasion, as a threat to the peace, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. As a result, the President orders several prohibitions, including the importation of certain Russian products into the United States, new investment in the Russian energy sector by US individuals, and any approval or financing of transactions by US individuals that would be prohibited under this order. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to take necessary actions to implement this order. The order does not affect the authority of executive departments or agencies, nor does it create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States.
