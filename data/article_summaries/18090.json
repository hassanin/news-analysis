The P5+1 (the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and China, facilitated by the European Union) has reached a set of initial understandings with Iran regarding its nuclear program. These understandings include significant limits on Iran's nuclear program and increased transparency and monitoring. In return, the P5+1 will provide limited, temporary relief from sanctions. This initial step expires in six months and does not represent an acceptable end state. The goal is to negotiate a long-term, comprehensive solution that addresses all concerns of the international community. The sanctions regime will remain in place and will be vigorously enforced. The next six months will be used to negotiate the details of a comprehensive solution. If Iran fails to address concerns, sanctions and pressure will be increased.
