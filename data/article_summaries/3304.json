President Biden has announced the appointment of 30 distinguished leaders in science and technology to his President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). This diverse group of individuals, including experts in various fields such as astrophysics, biochemistry, computer engineering, and neuroscience, will provide science, technology, and innovation policy recommendations to the President and the White House. The PCAST members include 20 elected members of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, five MacArthur "Genius" Fellows, two former Cabinet secretaries, and two Nobel laureates. This is the most diverse PCAST in U.S. history, with women making up half of the council and people of color and immigrants making up more than one-third. The co-chairs of the PCAST are Dr. Frances Arnold, a biochemical engineer and Nobel laureate, Dr. Eric Lander, a geneticist and the President's Science Advisor, and Dr. Maria Zuber, a geophysicist and planetary scientist.
