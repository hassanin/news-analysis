First Lady Melania Trump will celebrate the anniversary of her initiative, Be Best, at the White House on May 7, 2019. Be Best has had a positive impact on local communities by promoting kindness and addressing issues that children and families face. The celebration will include guest speakers representing the three pillars of the initiative: healthy living, kindness, and respect. The event will also focus on promoting a safer online environment for children and addressing the opioid crisis. Melania Trump is looking forward to thanking contributors and setting plans for expanding the initiative in the coming year.
