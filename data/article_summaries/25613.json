President Donald J. Trump has granted a full pardon to Patrick J. Nolan, a former Minority Leader of the California State Assembly. In 1994, Nolan faced charges of public corruption and had to choose between defending himself and risking decades in prison or accepting a guilty plea and a 33-month sentence. He chose the latter to support his wife and three young children. After his release, Nolan became an advocate for criminal justice reform and victims' rights. He played a significant role in the passage of various criminal justice reform acts and authored a guide for helping former prisoners reintegrate into society. While in prison, he organized religious-study groups and was known for his integrity and principles. Family, friends, and notable advocates, such as former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli and author Arnold Steinberg, have long sought clemency for Nolan. Given his contributions and circumstances, he is deemed deserving of this grant of executive clemency.
