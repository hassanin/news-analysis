The United States Senate has confirmed Judge Neil M. Gorsuch as the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Gorsuch, who replaces the late Justice Antonin Scalia, was praised by President Donald J. Trump for his judicial temperament, intellect, integrity, and record of independence. Gorsuch will be sworn into office on April 10, 2017, in two ceremonies. The first oath of office will be administered by the Chief Justice of the United States in a private ceremony at the Supreme Court, followed by a public ceremony at the White House where Justice Anthony M. Kennedy will administer the second oath of office.
