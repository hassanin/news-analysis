Vice President Kamala Harris addressed the Pacific Islands Forum, emphasizing the historic and future ties between the Pacific Islands and the United States. She acknowledged that the Pacific Islands have not received the diplomatic attention and support they deserve in recent years and pledged to change that. The United States plans to establish two new embassies in Tonga and Kiribati and appoint the first-ever US Envoy to the Pacific Islands Forum. They will also triple funding for economic development and ocean resilience in the region, increasing it from $21 million to $60 million per year for the next 10 years. The funds will be used to strengthen climate resilience, invest in marine planning and conservation, combat illegal fishing, and enhance maritime security. The Vice President also discussed cooperation on climate change, infrastructure projects, COVID-19 response, combatting illegal fishing, food security, maritime security, education, and disaster relief. She emphasized the importance of upholding the international rules-based order and working together to create new rules and norms for future challenges. The Vice President expressed the United States' commitment to partnership, friendship, and respect with the Pacific Islands.
