President Barack Obama has declared October 2011 as National Substance Abuse Prevention Month. In his proclamation, he emphasizes the importance of providing support systems for loved ones and talking to children about the dangers of alcohol and drugs. Substance abuse not only affects those with addiction problems, but also families and communities, causing damage to relationships, crime, and shattered dreams. The Obama Administration has made prevention a central component of its National Drug Control Strategy, focusing on community-based prevention organizations and evidence-based prevention strategies. By investing in prevention, the administration aims to decrease emergency room visits, lower rates of chronic disease, and improve student achievement and workforce readiness. The proclamation encourages collaboration among various stakeholders, including parents, educators, law enforcement, and community programs, to build a stronger and healthier America.
