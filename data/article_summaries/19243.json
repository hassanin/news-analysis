The White House has approved a new Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) on United States Cyber Incident Coordination. The directive outlines how the federal government will coordinate its response to significant cyber incidents. The PPD establishes five principles that will guide the government's response, including shared responsibility, risk-based response, respecting affected entities, unity of effort, and enabling restoration and recovery. The directive focuses on significant cyber incidents that pose a threat to national security, foreign relations, economy, public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety. It organizes response activities into three lines of effort and designates lead agencies for each. The PPD also establishes a three-tiered coordination architecture, including a National Policy Level, National Operational Level, and Field Level. It integrates cyber incident coordination policy with existing federal preparedness policy and requires the development of the National Cyber Incident Response Plan.
