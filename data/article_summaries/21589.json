In this article, President Obama discusses the problems with the US criminal justice system. He highlights the cycle of poverty, crime, and incarceration that is trapping too many Americans and weakening communities. The number of people in prison has increased from 500,000 to 2.2 million in the past 30 years. The President acknowledges that while some individuals deserve to be incarcerated, there has been an increase in non-violent offenders being sentenced for longer periods of time. He mentions the steps that have been taken to address this issue, such as investing in schools, reducing sentencing disparities, and focusing on the worst offenders. However, he acknowledges that there is still a lot of work to be done to make the system more fair and just. The President plans to travel around the country to meet with individuals who are working to fix the criminal justice system, including law enforcement officials and former prisoners. He also expresses his commitment to working with Congress to pass significant reform that will make the system more cost-effective, fair, and smart, while also improving community safety.
