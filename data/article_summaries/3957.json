Vice President Kamala Harris addressed the first-ever White House Day of Action on maternal health, emphasizing the urgent need to improve maternal health outcomes in the United States. She highlighted the alarming statistics that show women in the US have a higher rate of maternal mortality compared to other developed nations, with Black women, Native American women, and women in rural areas facing even greater risks. Harris attributed these disparities to systemic inequities and emphasized that addressing maternal health is crucial for public health and economic growth. She issued a nationwide Call to Action, calling on federal agencies, businesses, and non-profits to work together to solve the crisis. As part of this effort, the Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services launched a new initiative to designate birthing-friendly hospitals. Over 20 companies and non-profits also pledged to invest millions of dollars in maternal health efforts. Harris highlighted the importance of taking action to change the systems and challenge the status quo that has contributed to the maternal health crisis. She discussed her previous work in addressing racial disparities in maternal mortality and outlined the bills she has introduced in Congress to improve maternal health outcomes. Harris also emphasized the significance of the Build Back Better Act, which includes historic investments in maternal healthcare. The act aims to grow and diversify the perinatal nursing and doula workforce, promote health equity, and extend postpartum coverage for women on Medicaid. Harris concluded by reaffirming the commitment to protect and strengthen maternal and reproductive health, acknowledging the stories and voices of women who have experienced the tragedy of maternal mortality, and promising to take action.
