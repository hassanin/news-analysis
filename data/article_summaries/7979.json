Today, Vice President Harris announced the U.S.-Caribbean Partnership to Address the Climate Crisis 2030 (PACC 2030). This initiative aims to address climate adaptation, resilience, and clean energy programs in the Caribbean region. The Biden-Harris Administration recognizes the unique challenges faced by Caribbean nations in terms of climate and energy and is committed to finding solutions. The Caribbean is particularly vulnerable to the climate crisis, including rising sea levels and increased storm surge from hurricanes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further compounded the economic disruptions in the region. PACC 2030 will focus on building energy security, climate resilience, and supporting critical infrastructure and local economies. It will serve as the primary mechanism for regional climate adaptation and resilience and energy cooperation through 2030. The initiative aims to achieve two strategic objectives: 1) to enhance regional climate adaptation and resilience and 2) to strengthen energy security. PACC 2030 will organize its activities and programs under four pillars of action.
