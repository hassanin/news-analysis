The White House Monkeypox Response Coordinator, Bob Fenton, provided an update on the progress being made in combatting monkeypox. The large event pilot program has been successful, with over 11,000 vaccine doses administered at events such as Southern Decadence, Oakland Pride, and Black Pride in Atlanta. The program is specifically targeting Black and brown communities to advance equity. New case numbers have decreased nearly 50% since early August, and knowledge of monkeypox and the willingness to get vaccinated has increased among Americans. Dr. Fauci discussed two clinical trials that have been launched to treat those who have contracted the virus. One trial is being conducted in the United States, while the other is in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Dr. Walensky shared the latest data on the monkeypox outbreak, noting a decline in new cases but also a shift in cases towards men of color. Efforts are being made to ensure equity in vaccine distribution and access. Dr. Daskalakis discussed the importance of community outreach and the launch of a new Monkeypox Vaccine Equity Pilot Program to reach underserved communities. The program will provide vaccines, materials, and technical assistance to local health departments for smaller interventions. The goal is to address disparities and ensure that all populations have access to vaccines, testing, and treatment.
