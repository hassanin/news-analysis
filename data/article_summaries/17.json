President Biden is visiting the Philly Shipyard in Philadelphia, where a new offshore wind vessel is being built by union workers. This is part of President Biden's economic agenda, known as Bidenomics, which aims to fuel America's clean energy future and create American-made products with American workers. The offshore wind industry is rapidly expanding under President Biden's leadership, with companies announcing numerous shipbuilding projects and investments in manufacturing facilities and ports. The Biden-Harris Administration is also taking actions to build 30 gigawatts of offshore wind projects by 2030, including the first-ever Gulf of Mexico offshore wind lease sale. However, Republicans in Congress have voted to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act and block clean energy progress, potentially causing states to miss out on billions of dollars in investments. Despite opposition, Bidenomics is catalyzing America's clean energy and offshore wind industry, creating jobs and opportunities throughout the supply chain.
