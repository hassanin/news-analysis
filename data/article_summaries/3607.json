The Council of Economic Advisers, National Economic Council, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation, and Climate Policy Office recently hosted a meeting on incorporating climate risks into macroeconomic forecasting. The goal of the meeting was to create a public-private community of practice to better understand and manage the effects of climate change on the economy. The Biden-Harris Administration recognizes climate change as a significant risk to the macroeconomy and has instructed various government agencies to develop methods to account for climate risks in economic assumptions and budget outlooks. By sharing knowledge and fostering alignment on climate-related risk forecasting methodologies with the private sector, the administration aims to advance the US government's knowledge base and encourage private actors to incorporate climate into economic forecasting. This meeting marks the first step in building this community of practice.
