President Trump signed an Executive Order in April 2018 instructing agencies to reform welfare programs by reducing dependence and encouraging work. The Presidentâ€™s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) released a report recommending that current work requirements be expanded in non-cash welfare programs including food stamps, Medicaid, and Federal housing assistance programs. The report argues that while non-cash welfare programs have helped reduce material hardship, they have also reduced self-sufficiency. Critics of the report reject the scientific findings on poverty trends and mischaracterize the report's claims. The CEA report emphasizes the need for work requirements to increase self-sufficiency and argues that these requirements are not meant to punish the poor, but rather to overcome the work disincentive problem created by welfare programs. The report suggests that well-designed work requirements can lead to increased employment, reduced welfare dependency, and reduced poverty.
