The White House Office of the Press Secretary recently released a readout of a transition exercise that took place on January 14, 2017. The exercise involved members of the President-Elect's team and Cabinet designees, as well as current senior White House, Cabinet, and agency leaders. The purpose of the exercise was to provide a high-level perspective on the challenges that the next administration may face and to introduce the key authorities, policies, capabilities, and structures that are currently in place to respond to major domestic incidents. The participants discussed various response scenarios and shared experiences and lessons from previous incident responses. Both sides agreed that the exercise was productive and helped to advance the shared goal of conducting a professional and seamless transition. The readout also listed the participants from the Obama administration and the incoming administration.
