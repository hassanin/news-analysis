In this letter, President Barack Obama informs the Speaker of the House and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate about the deployment of U.S. Armed Forces personnel to Iraq. He states that the deployment is to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. The President has ordered further measures, including increased intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance focused on the threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). He has also ordered approximately 300 additional U.S. Armed Forces personnel to assess how to best train, advise, and support Iraqi security forces and to establish joint operations centers with them to share intelligence and coordinate planning against ISIL. The President assures that these forces will remain in Iraq until they are no longer needed. He emphasizes that this action is being undertaken in coordination with the Government of Iraq and in line with his responsibility to protect U.S. citizens and further U.S. national security and foreign policy interests. The President is providing this report to keep Congress informed, as required by the War Powers Resolution. He expresses his appreciation for Congress' support in these actions.
