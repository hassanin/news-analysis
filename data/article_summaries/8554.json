The Biden-Harris Administration is proposing a new rule called the Federal Supplier Climate Risks and Resilience Rule to address greenhouse gas emissions and protect the Federal Government's supply chains from climate-related financial risks. Under this proposed rule, major Federal contractors would be required to publicly disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related financial risks, as well as set science-based emissions reduction targets. The United States would be the first national government to implement such a requirement. The proposed rule aims to strengthen the resilience of vulnerable Federal supply chains, resulting in greater efficiencies and reduced climate risk. It is part of the President's Federal Sustainability Plan, which aims to achieve net-zero emissions procurement by 2050. The proposed rule covers approximately 85 percent of the emissions associated with the Federal supply chain. The Federal Government's own climate goals have already resulted in a 32 percent drop in energy use by buildings and vehicles, saving taxpayers $11.8 billion annually. The proposed rule is part of the President's comprehensive strategy to address the systemic risks that climate change poses to the economy. It leverages widely-adopted third-party standards and systems that many Federal contractors already use for disclosing emissions and setting emissions reduction targets. The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council is issuing this proposed rulemaking, which would amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to implement these changes if finalized. Public input on the proposed rule is invited.
