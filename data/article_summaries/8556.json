During a press briefing, White House Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre addressed several topics. She began by acknowledging the 70th anniversary of the Lavender Scare, a period in history when LGBTQI+ federal employees were discriminated against. President Biden issued a proclamation to remember those affected by this discrimination and to honor the contributions of LGBTQI+ public servants. Jean-Pierre also announced that the Biden-Harris administration will impose sanctions on actors involved in hostage-taking or wrongful detentions in Russia and Iran. These sanctions are part of the administration's efforts to deter hostage-taking and bring Americans home. Additionally, Jean-Pierre mentioned that it is Arab American Heritage Month and discussed the administration's efforts to promote equity and protect the civil rights of Arab Americans. During the Q&A session, Jean-Pierre responded to questions about House Republicans passing legislation on the budget and debt limit, the screening of extremism in the military, the establishment of processing centers in Colombia and Guatemala, the stability of regional banks, the situation in Sudan and efforts to evacuate Americans, the President's response to the death of Carolyn Bryant and the situation in Montana's state legislature. She also addressed questions about the President's use of a pocket card during press conferences, the immigration policy of expelling non-Mexicans to Mexico, and the President's stance on negotiations with Republicans regarding the debt ceiling. Jean-Pierre concluded the briefing by discussing the Inflation Reduction Act, its impact on the deficit, and the importance of reducing the deficit through tax reforms.
