President Donald J. Trump has applauded the U.S. Senate for passing the VA MISSION Act, a significant piece of legislation that aims to transform the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) into a high-performing and integrated healthcare system for the 21st century. The act will also provide veterans with more choice in their healthcare options, allowing them to choose between VA doctors or community healthcare providers. This legislation fulfills another promise made by President Trump to America's veterans, and is part of a broader effort to reform and modernize the VA to better serve the nation's heroes.
