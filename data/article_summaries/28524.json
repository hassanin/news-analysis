President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump participated in the 95th annual National Christmas Tree Lighting, which took place on November 30. The event, held at President's Park, featured musical performances and remarks from the President. The tradition of the National Christmas Tree began in 1923, and it has since become a symbol of peace. The Christmas tree is surrounded by smaller trees representing the 56 U.S. states, territories, and the District of Columbia. In his remarks, President Trump emphasized the importance of remembering the religious character of Christmas. He also expressed gratitude for various groups, including the military, law enforcement, and religious leaders. The Christmas tree lighting tradition has served as a symbol of hope through difficult times, with President Harry Truman delivering a message of optimism during World War II.
