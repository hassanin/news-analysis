President Biden has issued a proclamation declaring May 14-20 as National Women's Health Week in the United States. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of improving the health and well-being of women and girls and making their health a priority. It highlights the achievements of the Affordable Care Act, which ended discriminatory practices against women and expanded access to preventive care and maternity care. The President also addresses the challenges women face in accessing comprehensive reproductive health care services, including abortion and contraception, and expresses his commitment to protect and restore women's rights in this regard. The administration is also focused on addressing the maternal health crisis, particularly among Black and Native American women, through measures such as extending Medicaid coverage and diversifying the maternal health workforce. Mental health support for new and expecting mothers, prevention of gender-based violence, equal access to healthcare for transgender individuals, cancer prevention and research, and the prevention and management of conditions like heart disease and diabetes are also highlighted. The proclamation calls on all Americans to prioritize women's health, support health equity, and encourage women and girls to catch up on missed screenings, routine care, and vaccinations.
