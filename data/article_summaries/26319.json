On May 22, 2003, President Trump declared a national emergency due to obstacles to the reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration of peace and security, and the development of political and economic institutions in the country. This national emergency, initially declared in Executive Order 13303, has been modified and extended several times since then, including in Executive Order 13668 on May 27, 2014. President Trump has decided to continue the national emergency for another year, in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. This decision was announced on May 20, 2019, and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
