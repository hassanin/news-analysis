The White House has issued an Executive Order and a letter signed by the President on January 16th. The order authorizes the activation of selected reserve and certain individual ready reserve members of the Armed Forces to support the relief effort in Haiti. This activation will be used on a limited basis and will primarily focus on targeted functions related to the humanitarian mission. For example, it will allow for the deployment of reserve medical personnel to replace those currently deployed on the hospital ship Comfort, as well as the deployment of a Coast Guard unit to provide port security.
