National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Bjoern Seibert, Head of Cabinet of the President of the European Commission, held a secure video call on February 10 to discuss their concerns about Russia's military build-up around Ukraine. They also discussed preparations to impose severe economic costs and consequences on Russia if it chooses to escalate militarily. The two officials coordinated a potential transatlantic response, including financial sanctions and export controls, to be imposed in coordination by the United States, the European Union, and other partners and Allies. They also agreed to continue the close partnership between the United States and the European Union on various issues, such as energy security, COVID-19, health security, and international infrastructure development through initiatives like Build Back Better World and Global Gateway.
