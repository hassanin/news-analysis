Various North Dakota leaders, including Governor Doug Burgum, Senators John Hoeven and Heidi Heitkamp, and Representatives Kevin Cramer, have expressed their support for President Trump's tax reform goals. They believe that tax reform can simplify the tax code, lower rates for middle-class families, and set corporate tax rates that will allow U.S. businesses to compete globally. They also emphasize the need for bipartisan cooperation in achieving meaningful tax reform that encourages economic growth and saves taxpayers time and money. Other officials, such as Energy Secretary Rick Perry, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, and Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, have highlighted how tax reform can benefit specific industries, such as energy and agriculture, by reducing burdensome regulations and creating more opportunities for growth.
