In this article, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. recognizes the important contributions of care workers in America. Care workers, including child care workers, home care workers, and long-term care workers, play a vital role in raising children, assisting seniors, and supporting individuals with disabilities. Despite their essential work, care workers are among the lowest-paid workers in the country, leading to gender and racial wealth gaps. The COVID-19 pandemic further exposed the risks and challenges faced by care workers. 

To address these issues, President Biden's administration has invested $39 billion from the American Rescue Plan to support child care providers and increase pay and benefits for child care workers. Additional efforts include providing financial relief to child care workers through expanded earned income tax credits and proposing a $600 billion investment over ten years to expand access to high-quality child care and free preschool. The administration also aims to improve and expand Medicaid home- and community-based services, with a proposed investment of $150 billion over the next decade. These initiatives aim to improve the quality of care jobs, support family caregivers, and ensure fair recognition and compensation for care workers. 

President Biden proclaims April 2023 as Care Workers Recognition Month and calls upon all Americans to celebrate the contributions of care workers through appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.
