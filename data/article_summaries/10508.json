The President has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency and related measures dealing with the former Liberian regime of Charles Taylor will continue beyond July 22, 2009. The actions and policies of Charles Taylor and others, including the unlawful depletion of Liberian resources and the removal of funds and property, continue to undermine Liberia's transition to democracy. These actions pose a threat to the foreign policy of the United States, and therefore, the national emergency will continue.
