President Biden has announced eight new nominees for U.S. Attorneys across the country. These individuals have been selected for their dedication to enforcing the law, professionalism, experience, commitment to equal justice, and support for the independence of the Department of Justice. The President's initiative to address the increase in gun crime includes putting more police officers on the streets, supporting community prevention programs, and cracking down on illegal gun trafficking. Confirming U.S. Attorneys is crucial for these efforts. The nominees include Jessica D. Aber for the Eastern District of Virginia, Carla B. Freedman for the Northern District of New York, William J. Ihlenfeld, II for the Northern District of West Virginia, Christopher R. Kavanaugh for the Western District of Virginia, Darcie N. McElwee for the District of Maine, Breon S. Peace for the Eastern District of New York, William S. Thompson for the Southern District of West Virginia, and Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York.
