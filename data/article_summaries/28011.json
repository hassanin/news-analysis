The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) recognized individuals and initiatives of the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program for their outstanding work in reducing drug trafficking and production in the United States. The HIDTA program provides assistance to law enforcement agencies operating in critical drug-trafficking regions. The program includes 33 HIDTAs across the United States and its territories. ONDCP Director Jim Carroll commended the collaboration between HIDTAs and law enforcement, highlighting their efforts to keep dangerous drugs out of communities and their contribution in providing information on evolving drug threats. In 2018, the HIDTA Program initiatives dismantled nearly 3,000 drug trafficking organizations, seized drugs with a wholesale value of $16.5 billion, and made almost 99,000 arrests. The article also mentions that in 2018, President Trump established the first new HIDTA program in 17 years to combat emerging threats in Alaska.
