President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Congress and the Federal Register stating that the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans will continue beyond June 26, 2022. This national emergency was initially declared in 2001 and has been expanded in scope in 2021. The President cites acts of extremist violence, obstructionist activity, and the situation in the Western Balkans as ongoing threats to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, it has been determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
