President Trump has released the "National Strategy for Critical and Emerging Technologies," which aims to promote and protect the United States' competitive edge in various fields such as artificial intelligence, energy, quantum information science, communication and networking technologies, semiconductors, military, and space technologies. The strategy acknowledges the need for American dominance in science and technology, especially as countries like China and Russia employ tactics such as technology theft and coercing companies to hand over intellectual property. The Trump Administration's strategy includes strengthening rules, enforcing agreements, and collaborating with allies to protect national security innovation and secure a technology advantage. The strategy also highlights the importance of promoting the national security innovation base, with the administration already taking significant steps in this area, such as the American AI Initiative and the National Quantum Initiative. The goal is to accelerate leadership in future industries, invest in research and development, remove regulatory barriers, develop a skilled workforce, and build strong relationships with allies and partners. The National Strategy for Critical and Emerging Technologies aims to support innovation, commercialization, and the protection of the American way of life.
