The White House has launched the "Healthy Communities Challenge" to help uninsured Americans gain coverage under the Affordable Care Act. The challenge will focus on communities with high numbers or percentages of uninsured individuals. At the end of the open enrollment period, the Department of Health and Human Services will compare the number of new Marketplace signups in participating communities with estimates of the eligible uninsured population to determine which communities made the most progress. The winning community will receive recognition and a visit from President Obama. Phoenix, Arizona is one of the 20 communities participating in the challenge. The article also provides information on health insurance coverage in Arizona, including the number of people covered through the Health Insurance Exchange and the affordability of plans. It emphasizes the importance of tax credits, the availability of multiple insurance issuers, and the potential savings when consumers switch to lower-cost plans. While progress has been made in reducing the uninsured rate in Arizona, there is still work to be done, with 194,000 eligible uninsured individuals in the Phoenix region.
