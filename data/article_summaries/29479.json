The recent Supreme Court ruling on preventing the removal of certain aliens convicted of aggravated felonies that constitute "crimes of violence" highlights the need for congressional action. The case, which was first argued and briefed under the Obama Administration, presents an opportunity for Congress to close dangerous loopholes. It is important for Congress to pass a fix to close these loopholes so that violent criminal aliens can be promptly removed from the United States. Failure to act will result in the inability to remove non-citizens convicted of violent felonies, including domestic assault and battery, burglary, and child abuse, posing a threat to public safety.
