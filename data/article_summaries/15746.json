Egypt has achieved several significant milestones in its transition to democracy. The democratically-elected representatives of the People's Assembly met for the first time since the revolution, and legislative authority was transferred to them by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. Field Marshal Tantawi has also taken steps to lift the state of emergency that has been in place for decades. Tomorrow, Egyptians will commemorate the anniversary of the revolution that made Egypt's transition to democracy possible. The United States congratulates the Egyptian people and their government on these important steps and pledges to continue supporting them in their pursuit of universal values and a better future.
