This article discusses an executive order issued by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to strengthen access to affordable, high-quality contraception in the United States. The order emphasizes the importance of women having access to healthcare, including contraception and family planning services, and highlights the benefits of contraception in improving health outcomes, economic stability, and women's overall well-being. It acknowledges that access to contraception still varies based on various factors and that the recent Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has had devastating implications for women's health. The executive order directs the administration to build on previous efforts to protect and expand access to reproductive healthcare services, including contraception and abortion. It outlines several actions to improve access and affordability under the Affordable Care Act, support access through Medicaid and Medicare, and promote access to contraception across federal healthcare programs and human services programs. The order also encourages sharing best practices for making contraception available in private health coverage and higher education institutions. The article concludes with general provisions stating that the order does not impair existing authorities or create new rights or benefits enforceable by any party against the United States.
