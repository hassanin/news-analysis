In a statement, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs congratulated Senator Reid and Chairmen Baucus and Dodd for their work on health insurance reform. He mentioned that thanks to their efforts, progress has been made in solving this long-standing problem. The President is pleased with the inclusion of a public option for health coverage, with the provision for states to opt out. The President supports the public option because it can hold insurance companies accountable through choice and competition. However, Gibbs also acknowledged that there is still much work to be done.
