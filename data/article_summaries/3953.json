On December 7, 2022, the President signed two important laws. The first one is called the "Safe Connections Act of 2022" (H.R. 7132). This law requires mobile service providers to separate the phone line of a survivor of domestic violence, human trafficking, or related crimes from a shared mobile service contract with the abuser, upon receiving a separation request from the survivor. The second law is the "Speak Out Act" (S. 4524), which prohibits the enforcement of nondisclosure or nondisparagement clauses in cases involving sexual assault or sexual harassment. This means that such clauses agreed to before a dispute arises will not be enforceable in court. The President thanked several representatives and senators for their leadership in passing these laws.
