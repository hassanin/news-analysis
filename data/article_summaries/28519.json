The United States and Argentina have reached an agreement that will allow US pork to enter the Argentine market for the first time since 1992. The agreement was made following a meeting between Vice President Mike Pence and President Mauricio Macri of Argentina. This is seen as a win for American pork producers and is part of President Trump's efforts to break down international trade barriers and promote fair trade. The United States is the world's top pork exporter, and this agreement opens up a potential $10 million per year market for American pork producers. Argentine food safety officials will visit the US to verify the meat inspection system before exports can resume. The US is also working to expand trade of other agricultural products with Argentina, such as beef, poultry, and fruits.
