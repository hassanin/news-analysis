On October 27, 2006, the President declared a national emergency regarding the situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo due to widespread violence and atrocities that threatened regional stability. This national emergency was further addressed in a subsequent executive order in 2014. As of October 25, 2021, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has decided to continue the national emergency for another year, citing the ongoing unusual and extraordinary threat to U.S. foreign policy. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
