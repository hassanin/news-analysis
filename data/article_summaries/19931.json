President Obama released a statement expressing his satisfaction with the passing of a plan that will cut spending and keep the government running for the next two weeks. However, he emphasized the need for a more sustainable approach and called on Democratic and Republican leaders to start immediate discussions with the Vice President, Chief of Staff, and Budget Director. He urged for a bipartisan agreement that cuts spending and reduces deficits without harming economic growth or important investments in education and research. The President emphasized the importance of reaching this agreement quickly and without any party's social or political agenda.
