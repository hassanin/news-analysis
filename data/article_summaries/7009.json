On December 10, 2021, the President signed into law S. 610, also known as the "Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act." This law delays the Medicare sequester and introduces other changes to Medicare payments. It also modifies procedures related to federal budget scorekeeping and federal borrowing. The President expressed gratitude to various leaders, including House Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, and Senate Majority Leader Schumer, for their leadership in passing this legislation.
