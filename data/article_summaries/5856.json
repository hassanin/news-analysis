The Biden administration is issuing a new General License to expand authorizations for commercial and financial transactions in Afghanistan. This license allows transactions involving Afghanistan and its governing institutions that would otherwise be prohibited by U.S. sanctions, as long as they do not involve the Taliban, Haqqani Network, associated entities, or blocked individuals in leadership roles. The goal is to ensure that sanctions do not hinder economic activity needed to address the humanitarian and economic crisis in Afghanistan. The administration has also provided significant humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and is working with international partners to provide economic assistance. Discussions are ongoing about the best use of frozen Afghan government accounts, including the possibility of recapitalizing the Afghan central bank. The Treasury Department is clarifying its stance on commercial transactions with Afghan civil servants, allowing them to continue working with individuals who were part of the Afghan government before August 2021. The license aims to support the Afghan economy and attract investment while preventing material support to sanctioned individuals.
