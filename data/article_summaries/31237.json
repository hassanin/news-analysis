On March 14, 2020, President Donald Trump issued Proclamation 9984, which suspended and limited the entry of individuals who pose a risk of transmitting the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) into the United States. This proclamation initially focused on individuals who had been in the People's Republic of China, then expanded to include individuals who had been in the Islamic Republic of Iran, and most recently, the Schengen Area. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has determined that the virus poses a serious public health threat and could overwhelm the public health system if sustained human-to-human transmission occurs on a large scale in the United States. The proclamation now includes the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, as both countries are experiencing widespread person-to-person transmission of the virus. The United States Government is unable to effectively evaluate and monitor all travelers arriving from these countries, which threatens the security of the transportation system, infrastructure, and national security. However, the free flow of commerce between the United States and these countries remains an economic priority. The proclamation includes exceptions for certain individuals, such as lawful permanent residents, spouses and children of U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, and individuals traveling for purposes related to containment or mitigation of the virus. The proclamation will remain in effect until terminated by the President.
