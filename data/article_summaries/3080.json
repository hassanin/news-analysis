The President is urging Congress to pass legislation immediately to adopt the Tentative Agreement between railroad workers and operators without any modifications or delay. The agreement, which was approved by labor and management negotiators in September, includes a historic 24% pay raise for rail workers, improved health care benefits, and the ability for operating craft workers to take unscheduled leave for medical needs. The majority of unions in the industry have already voted to approve the deal. The Secretaries of Labor, Agriculture, and Transportation believe that there is no path to resolve the dispute at the bargaining table and have recommended seeking Congressional action. The President emphasizes that a rail shutdown would have devastating economic consequences, potentially putting as many as 765,000 Americans out of work in the first two weeks alone. It could also impact access to chemicals for clean drinking water and disrupt the ability of farms and ranches to feed their livestock. While the President acknowledges concerns about the inability to take leave for illness or family care, he believes that Congress must adopt the deal to prevent a shutdown and protect the economy. Any modifications to the agreement would risk delay and further harm. The President calls on Congress to prioritize the well-being of workers and deliver the bill to his desk before December 9th to avoid disruption.
