President Barack Obama has proclaimed October 9 to October 15, 2011, as Fire Prevention Week in the United States. The theme for this year's Fire Prevention Week is "Protect Your Family from Fire." The proclamation emphasizes the devastating effects of fires and the importance of practicing fire safety throughout the year. It encourages Americans to take steps such as installing and maintaining smoke alarms, practicing safe cooking behaviors, and creating and practicing escape plans. The proclamation also highlights the need for communities to work together in protecting themselves from wildfires by implementing Community Wildfire Protection Plans. The proclamation recognizes the dedication and sacrifice of firefighters and other first responders and calls on all Americans to participate in Fire Prevention Week activities and renew their efforts to prevent fires. On October 16, 2011, the flag of the United States will be flown at half-staff on all Federal office buildings in honor of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service.
