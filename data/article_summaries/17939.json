On November 7, 2011, the White House Office of the Press Secretary released a notice stating that the national emergency with respect to Iran, which was declared on November 14, 1979, would be continued for another year. This national emergency was declared due to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by the situation in Iran. The continuation of the national emergency was deemed necessary because relations with Iran had not yet returned to normal and the process of implementing agreements with Iran from January 19, 1981, was still ongoing. This notice was published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress. The statement was signed by President Barack Obama.
