Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin expresses his support for President Barack Obama's compromise tax proposal. He believes that the proposal is a major victory for working families as it extends unemployment benefits, makes raising a family, running a small business, and going to college more affordable, and reduces the middle class tax burden by an additional 2%. Mayor Benjamin urges Congress to follow the President's example and help those struggling in cities like Columbia.
