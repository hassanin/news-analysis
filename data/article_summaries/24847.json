President Barack Obama has proclaimed the week beginning on the third Sunday in October as National Forest Products Week in the United States. This proclamation recognizes the importance of forests and their products in the country's economy and daily lives. The president emphasizes the role of forests in providing recreation opportunities, habitats for wildlife, and essential products such as paper and wood. Forests also contribute to reducing carbon emissions by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide. In light of the increasing threats to forests, such as diseases, insect infestations, droughts, and wildfires, the administration is taking action to preserve these vital resources. Through initiatives like America's Great Outdoors, communities are empowered to protect their forested land. The proclamation calls on the American people to acknowledge and appreciate the individuals responsible for the stewardship of forests and the preservation of natural resources.
