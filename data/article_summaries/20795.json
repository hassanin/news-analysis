The White House has announced the appointment of the 2012-2013 Class of White House Fellows. The Fellows come from diverse backgrounds and professions and have shown a strong commitment to public service and leadership. The White House Fellows Program was created in 1964 to give promising American leaders high-level experience with the workings of the Federal government. The Fellows also take part in an education program designed to broaden their knowledge of leadership, policy formulation, and current affairs. Community service is another essential element of the program, and Fellows participate in service projects throughout the year in the Washington, DC area. Selection as a White House Fellow is highly competitive and based on a record of professional achievement, evidence of leadership potential, and a proven commitment to public service. The 2012-2013 Class of Fellows and their biographies are included in the article.
