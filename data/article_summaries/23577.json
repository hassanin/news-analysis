In his speech at the Asia Society in New York, Tom Donilon, the National Security Advisor to the President, discussed the importance of the United States' relationship with the Asia-Pacific region. He outlined the reasons why the US is rebalancing its global posture to focus more on Asia, including the region's growing economic importance and the need for US engagement in the emerging political and strategic order. Donilon emphasized the significance of strong alliances, particularly with Japan, South Korea, and Australia, and the need for trilateral coordination between these countries. He also discussed the US' commitment to the defense of its allies, particularly in response to the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear program. Donilon highlighted the importance of building a constructive relationship with China, acknowledging both cooperation and competition between the two countries. He called for a deeper military-to-military dialogue with China to address sources of insecurity and potential competition. Donilon also emphasized the need for a strong regional architecture and the importance of strengthening regional institutions, such as ASEAN and the East Asia Summit. He discussed the territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas and the need for peaceful and diplomatic solutions. Finally, Donilon emphasized the importance of building an economic architecture that promotes free and fair trade and allows for the economic growth of the Asia-Pacific region. He highlighted the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as a key component of this economic strategy and expressed the US' commitment to completing negotiations by the end of 2013.
