Second Lady Karen Pence, along with the Congressional Club and the Comfort Crew for Military Kids, assembled 500 care packages for military children. Each package contains an animated DVD, a guided journal, a teddy bear, a guidebook, and items to help keep the family connected during separation. Mrs. Pence plans to distribute the kits to children with a deployed parent during her visit to Fort Carson in Colorado Springs. The Comfort Crew for Military Kids is a non-profit organization that supports military children through programs designed to strengthen their social and emotional resilience. They provide comfort kits and educational resources to military children worldwide.
