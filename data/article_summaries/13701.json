The statement by NSC Spokesperson Bernadette Meehan addresses the situation in the Yarmouk refugee camp in Syria. The camp has been under siege by the Syrian regime for nearly two years, resulting in the denial of essential supplies to its residents. The statement calls for an end to hostilities, access for humanitarian aid, and safe passage for civilians who wish to leave. It also emphasizes the need for all parties to comply with international humanitarian law and condemns the indiscriminate attacks on civilians. The statement further applauds the efforts of the UN Relief and Works Agency and highlights the dire situation faced by over 440,000 people trapped in besieged communities across Syria. It stresses the urgent need for a political solution to end the conflict and hold perpetrators accountable for their actions.
