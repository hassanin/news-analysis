In an embargoed preview of President Biden's American Jobs Plan, a senior administration official outlined the key elements of the plan. The plan aims to create millions of good-paying jobs, rebuild the country's infrastructure, and position the United States to out-compete China. It will focus on four main areas: transportation infrastructure, modernizing roads and bridges, doubling federal funding for public transit, and investing in the electrification of the transport system; modern infrastructure for homes, including clean water access, universal affordable broadband, and upgrading the electric power system; investing in the care infrastructure to reduce waitlists for care and expand jobs in the homecare workforce; and investing in innovation and R&D infrastructure, including clean energy R&D and domestic incentives for manufacturing. The plan will be funded by corporate tax reform, including raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent and strengthening a global minimum tax. The official emphasized that the plan will create millions of jobs and is an important moment to demonstrate the ability of the United States to deliver for its people. The plan will be presented to Congress for further discussion and consideration.
