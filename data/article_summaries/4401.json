Federal funding is also available for debris removal and emergency protective measures in Maui County, as well as emergency protective measures in Hawaii County. Hazard mitigation measures statewide can also receive federal funding. Mr. Maona N. Ngwira of FEMA will coordinate federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Damage assessments are ongoing, and additional forms of assistance may be designated later.
