Psaki mentioned a new report from Moody's that states the President's Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework and Build Back Better agenda will add almost 2 million jobs per year on average and help stabilize prices and decrease inflationary pressure.

During the Q&A session, Psaki addressed various topics, including the debt limit, travel restrictions, Nord Stream, infrastructure negotiations, the January 6 select committee, inflation concerns, and COVID-19 protocols at the White House. She also mentioned that the First Lady will be heading to Tokyo for the Olympics and that the President will invite the Milwaukee Bucks to the White House.
