The Obama administration, private-sector companies, foundations, and organizations have announced $50 million in commitments to support women and girls. These commitments include a pledge by more than two dozen leading companies to take actions to close the gender pay gap, new resources to empower community college students to negotiate their first salaries, campaigns to change how the country values caregiving and improve portrayals of women in media, and enhanced global efforts to promote gender equality. The commitments and initiatives build on the work that President Obama has done since taking office to ensure that women and girls have equal rights, treatment, and protections. The United State of Women Summit will highlight the progress that has been made and discuss solutions to the challenges that still lie ahead.
