The Small Business Network of the Americas (SBNA) was announced by President Obama to promote job creation and trade among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Western Hemisphere. The SBNA aims to expand resources for business development, provide business counseling services, and connect businesses across the hemisphere. It plans to achieve these goals by expanding the Small Business Development Center (SBDC) model, connecting existing SBDCs and similar SME support centers, providing matchmaking services and export counseling, enhancing virtual trade platforms, and encouraging diaspora entrepreneurship. The SBNA also plans to provide working capital grants and financing for eligible applicants, as well as loan guarantees to encourage financial institutions to increase lending to SMEs. The goal is to address the credit gap that SMEs face in Latin America and the Caribbean and promote increased access to capital for SMEs.
