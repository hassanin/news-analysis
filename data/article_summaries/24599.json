On July 29, 2009, President Obama conducted a town hall discussion at Broughton High School in Raleigh, North Carolina, focusing on the rising cost of healthcare and the need for reform. Sara Coleman, owner of Cupcake Shoppe Bakery in Raleigh, introduced the President and shared her struggle to provide healthcare insurance for her employees. Despite the economic downturn, Sara's business has remained steady, but she is hesitant to open additional bakeries due to the unstable economic climate and difficulty retaining employees without healthcare coverage.

In Bristol, Virginia, the President visited a Kroger Supermarket to discuss the need for healthcare reform with approximately 150 Kroger employees. Jay Cummins, President of Kroger's Mid-Atlantic Division, introduced the President. Kroger is the largest traditional supermarket retailer in the US, with over 3,600 stores in 31 states. Approximately 70% of Kroger's store associates are represented by a union, and the company provides competitive wages and healthcare benefits for its employees.

Overall, the President's events in North Carolina and Virginia aimed to highlight the impact of rising healthcare costs on small businesses and the need for comprehensive healthcare reform.
