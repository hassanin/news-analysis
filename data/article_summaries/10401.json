This article discusses President Obama's efforts to create pathways to the middle class for all Americans. The President believes in a basic bargain that if you work hard and play by the rules, you should be able to find a good job, feel secure in your community, and support a family. When President Obama took office, the US economy was losing over 800,000 jobs a month, so he took swift action to stop the rapid loss of jobs by giving tax cuts to working families, keeping teachers in the classroom, and investing in clean energy and manufacturing. 

President Obama has acted to prevent millions from slipping into poverty and helped build a path to the middle class. He has provided tax relief for all Americans, with refundable tax credits focused on working families. He has also reformed K-12 and early education to create opportunity and mobility for children, invested in making college affordable for more families, and secured affordable health care coverage. Additionally, the Administration has helped responsible homeowners stay in their homes by modifying their mortgages and proposed an investment in repurposing and rehabilitating vacant properties.

The President has also created pathways back to work through subsidized jobs and summer employment for low-income adults and youth. He has proposed a new fund to support employment opportunities for low-income youth and adults and for the long-term unemployed. The Obama Administration has also implemented initiatives to strengthen cities and communities by partnering with local governments, investing in poverty-stricken areas, and promoting economic growth.
