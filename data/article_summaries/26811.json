The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy has released the annual estimate of poppy cultivation and opium production in Afghanistan. According to the report, poppy cultivation decreased by 28% in 2019 compared to 2018, while potential pure opium production increased by 21%. The decline in cultivation was driven by low opium prices during planting time, while the increase in production was attributed to favorable weather and harvesting conditions. The large-scale cultivation and production of opium in Afghanistan pose challenges to the country's governance and rule of law, and the drug revenue generated by insurgents contributes to insecurity and corruption. While Afghan heroin is not a major factor in the United States' opioid epidemic, its trafficking affects both Afghanistan and countries along global drug trafficking routes. The US government will continue working with Afghanistan to address this issue.
