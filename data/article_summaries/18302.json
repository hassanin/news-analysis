The White House Office of the Press Secretary held a conference call to explain the sanctions that were just rolled out against Russia. The call was led by senior administration officials who provided an overview of the actions taken by both the United States and Europe. They emphasized the need to impose greater costs on Russia for its actions in Ukraine, including the shoot-down of MH17 and the continued support for separatists. The officials mentioned the buildup of Russian forces near the Ukrainian border and the flow of heavy weapons into Ukraine. They also highlighted the coordination between the United States and Europe in imposing sectoral sanctions on Russia. The actions taken included sanctions on major Russian state-owned banks, a defense technology firm, and restrictions on exports of certain technologies. The officials stated that these sanctions have already had a substantial impact on the Russian economy, with the Russian ruble depreciating and capital flight from Russia expected to reach $100 billion. The officials emphasized that the door is still open for Russia to de-escalate the situation and meet the conditions set by the international community. They also mentioned that there are additional sanctions available if Russia does not change its course.
