The White House Office of the Vice President announced the availability of $500 million in funding for partnerships between community colleges and businesses to train workers with the skills needed by employers. This funding is part of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training grant program. The Department of Labor will announce approximately $500 million in new awards later this year. The announcement was made at Davidson County Community College in North Carolina as part of the Community College to Career bus tour. The grants will enable institutions of higher education to partner with businesses to expand and improve education and career training programs. The program aligns with President Obama's goal of increasing the proportion of college graduates in the United States. Eligible institutions of higher education will receive at least $2.5 million in grant awards. The first round of grants, totaling approximately $500 million, was awarded in September 2011. The TAA Community College and Career Training program was authorized by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and funded with $2 billion over four years.
