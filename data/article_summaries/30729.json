President Trump's "America First" reforms have led to a record-setting economy, with over 3.8 million jobs created since he took office. Manufacturing jobs have returned at the fastest pace in over two decades, and the President's tax cuts have played a significant role in the booming economy. The GDP growth exceeded expectations at 4.2 percent last quarter, putting the U.S. economy on track to achieve the President's goal of 3 percent annual growth. President Trump has also renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to protect American workers and industries. Additionally, the Trump Administration has implemented legislation, regulatory reforms, and initiatives to ensure that the wealthier America benefits all citizens. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced taxes by $5.5 trillion, has put more money back into American paychecks and provided significant benefits for lower-income households. The President has also focused on workforce training through initiatives such as the Pledge to America's Workers, which has garnered commitments from companies to create millions of new opportunities for American workers.
