On July 19, 2017, President Donald Trump issued a statement declaring that the national emergency with respect to transnational criminal organizations, which was originally declared in 2011, will continue for another year. The President stated that these organizations pose a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States due to their involvement in widespread illegal activities, disregard for human life, facilitation of violent conflicts, and support for dangerous individuals. The President's decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
