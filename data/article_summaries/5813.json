In this speech, Vice President Kamala Harris visits the Sanmina Kenosha Facility in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin. She is joined by Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and Senator Tammy Baldwin. Harris discusses the importance of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States, particularly in places like Kenosha. She highlights the decline of American manufacturing in the 1990s and the subsequent loss of jobs. Harris emphasizes that President Joe Biden and herself ran for office to address this issue and create jobs in America. She mentions their efforts to expand access to high-speed Internet and the resulting demand for products like fiber-optic cable. Harris announces that Nokia, a Finnish company, will be expanding the factory in Kenosha and hiring up to 200 new employees to build parts for high-speed Internet connections. She credits Senator Baldwin for her advocacy in ensuring that these projects meet the "Made in America" requirements. Harris explains that this investment in manufacturing is part of a larger strategy to strengthen the American economy and create opportunities for working people. She refers to this strategy as "Bidenomics" and highlights the success of their administration in creating jobs, reducing unemployment, and supporting small businesses. Harris concludes by expressing her belief in the potential of America and its ability to rebuild and thrive through investments in workers and families.
