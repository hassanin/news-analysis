Second Lady Karen Pence is excited to announce the opening of a new art therapy studio at Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health in Indianapolis. She had the privilege of spending time in the studio with the Riley Kids, who were hard at work creating art. The studio will benefit patients, their siblings, and their parents for years to come. Pence is passionate about art therapy and has an initiative called "Art Therapy: Healing with the HeART." She plans to visit the studio again in the summer to create another syringe art canvas.
