The President is pleased that the Senate has taken bipartisan action to support small businesses and startups by passing key ideas proposed by the President. The administration is particularly pleased with the investor protections added to the crowdfunding provision. The President urges the House to adopt these changes. However, the statement also emphasizes that there is still more work to be done to strengthen the economy, such as investing in infrastructure, education, and reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank.
