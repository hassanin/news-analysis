The article is a notice from the White House informing Congress about the continuation of the national emergency with respect to North Korea. The national emergency was originally declared in 2008 due to the threat of proliferation of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula. The emergency was expanded in 2010 to address the actions and policies of the North Korean government, including the sinking of a South Korean navy ship and nuclear tests. Additional steps were taken in 2011 to implement import restrictions and complement existing arms control measures. The article states that the national emergency and the measures taken to address it must continue beyond June 26, 2014, due to the ongoing threat posed by North Korea. The notice is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act and will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
