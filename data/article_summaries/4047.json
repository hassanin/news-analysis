The first convoy of humanitarian assistance since Hamas's terrorist attack on Israel has crossed the border into Gaza and reached Palestinians in need. The opening of this supply route was the result of diplomatic engagement at the highest levels. The United States expressed the urgency of humanitarian assistance and thanked President Al-Sisi of Egypt, Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel, and the United Nations for allowing the resumption of aid. The United States remains committed to ensuring that civilians in Gaza have access to essential resources without diversion by Hamas. Efforts will also continue to keep the Rafah crossing operational for the movement of aid and to protect civilians in accordance with international humanitarian law. Additionally, the United States is working with Egypt and Israel to facilitate the safe exit of U.S. citizens and their immediate family members from Gaza.
