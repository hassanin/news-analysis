The United States, along with 14 states and a tribal government, have reached an agreement with Old General Motors (now known as Motors Liquidation Company or MLC) to establish an environmental trust. This trust will be used to clean up and repurpose 89 properties left behind in the GM bankruptcy. Old GM will commit $773 million to clean up the properties, two-thirds of which are contaminated with hazardous waste. The trust will give local communities the opportunity to participate in designing the strategy for repurposing these properties in accordance with their development objectives. The agreement is expected to be approved early next year. The trust is unprecedented in size, speed of settlement, and level of local involvement. It will create jobs, benefit the environment, and improve human health in former auto communities. The trust will be the largest and most inclusive environmental trust in the United States. The $773 million will be divided for cleaning up the properties, covering administrative activities, and activities that help return the properties to beneficial use. The Trustee, Mr. Elliott Laws, will work closely with federal, state, and local communities to implement the cleanups and sell or repurpose the properties. The breakdown of the $773 million support is provided for each state.
