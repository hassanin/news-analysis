The article discusses the importance of providing affordable college education without burdening students with excessive loan debt. The administration claims to have taken action to assist millions of borrowers, particularly those with incomes below $75,000 per year. However, Republican officials at both the state and congressional levels have opposed these efforts. The Supreme Court recently sided with the Republicans, resulting in a setback for reducing student loan debt. The administration emphasizes that reducing student loan debt and providing relief for families has been a priority throughout their careers. They cite examples such as taking on predatory for-profit colleges as California Attorney General and securing large increases to Pell Grants. The administration's income-driven repayment plan aims to cut undergraduate loan payments in half by capping monthly payments at five percent of income. President Biden and the administration are committed to delivering relief to student debt borrowers in order to recover from the pandemic and move forward. They plan to create an alternative path for relief through the Higher Education Act, protecting borrowers' credit for 12 months and launching a new income-based repayment program to reduce monthly payments for undergraduate borrowers. The administration will continue to fight for accessible postsecondary education without excessive student loan debt.
