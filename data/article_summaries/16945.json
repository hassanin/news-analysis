The White House has launched the "Healthy Communities Challenge" to engage communities with large numbers of uninsured individuals. The goal is to help these communities reach the remaining 10.5 million uninsured Americans eligible for Marketplace coverage. The Department of Health and Human Services, along with State-based Marketplaces, will publish tallies of new signups in participating communities at the end of the open enrollment period. The community that makes the most progress will receive recognition, a healthier community, and a visit from President Obama. Great Falls, Montana is one of the 20 communities participating in the challenge. The fact sheet also provides information on health insurance coverage in Montana, including affordable options and tax credits available to individuals and families. It emphasizes the importance of shopping for plans and highlights the savings that can be achieved by switching to the lowest-cost plan within a coverage level. While progress has been made in reducing the uninsured rate in Montana, there is still work to be done, with 13,000 uninsured individuals eligible for the Marketplace in the Great Falls region.
