President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Missouri and ordered Federal assistance to aid in the recovery efforts from severe storms, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred between March 11 and April 16, 2019. The Federal funding will be available for State, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, to help with emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities in various counties. The funding will also be available for statewide hazard mitigation measures. Seamus K. Leary has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Additional designations may be made in the future if requested by the State and based on further damage assessments. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
