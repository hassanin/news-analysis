President Donald J. Trump has signed the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Amendments Act (HIFPAA) of 2018 into law. This act imposes stricter sanctions on Hizballah, a radical Islamist terrorist organization closely associated with the Iranian regime. Hizballah has a history of kidnapping, torturing, and murdering American citizens, including the 1983 attack on the Marine Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon. The US will continue to take action against Hizballah and its allies in honor of the victims. Under President Trump's leadership, the US has already imposed significant sanctions on Hizballah and the Iranian regime. The new legislation aims to isolate Hizballah from the international financial system and reduce its funding. The sanctions will target individuals, government agencies, and networks associated with Hizballah that engage in drug trafficking or other transnational crimes. The Administration worked with Senators Crapo, Brown, Rubio, and Shaheen, as well as Representatives Royce and Engel on this legislation to counter Iran's Hizballah proxy. Additionally, on November 5th, all US nuclear-related sanctions against Iran, lifted under the Iran nuclear deal, will be reimposed.
