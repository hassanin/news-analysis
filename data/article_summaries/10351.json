President Barack Obama has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House outlining an alternative plan for pay increases for federal civilian employees. The plan is in accordance with Title 5, United States Code, which allows the president to implement alternative pay plans if there is a national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare. The president acknowledges the sacrifices made by civilian federal employees during a three-year pay freeze and states that as the country's economic recovery continues, efforts must be made to maintain a sustainable fiscal course. The alternative plan for 2015 includes a 1.0 percent across-the-board pay increase and maintains the current locality pay percentages. The president believes that this decision will not significantly impact the ability to attract and retain a qualified federal workforce. The adjustments will take effect in January 2015.
