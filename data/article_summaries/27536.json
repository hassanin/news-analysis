President Donald J. Trump has issued a proclamation declaring September 17-23, 2017, as National Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Week. The proclamation recognizes the significant contributions that HBCUs have made and continue to make to the welfare and prosperity of the United States. HBCUs were established to provide opportunities for Black Americans to receive a high-quality education in the face of segregation and racial prejudice. Over the past 150 years, HBCUs have produced leaders in various fields and have contributed to the creation of a thriving Black middle class. Currently, there are over 100 HBCUs in the United States, enrolling more than 300,000 students. President Trump's administration aims to support and ensure the sustainability of HBCUs as institutions of higher education. The proclamation also mentions the Annual White House HBCU Summit, where HBCU presidents, faculty members, students, and other stakeholders address the priorities outlined in the Executive Order to Promote Excellence and Innovation at HBCUs. The proclamation concludes by calling upon educators, public officials, organizations, corporations, and all Americans to observe this week and acknowledge the contributions of HBCUs and their alumni.
