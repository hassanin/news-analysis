President Donald Trump has issued a proclamation declaring October 2018 as National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. The proclamation emphasizes the commitment to eradicating domestic violence and creating homes that are places of refuge and love. It acknowledges that domestic violence affects both men and women, but the majority of victims are women. The proclamation highlights the efforts of advocates, clergy, service providers, healthcare providers, educators, law enforcement officers, family members, and friends in assisting and comforting victims. The administration is working with various organizations to prosecute offenders and provide support to survivors. The fiscal year 2019 budget proposal includes an increase in funding for programs administered by the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women. The Department of Health and Human Services is also supporting initiatives to train healthcare providers and implement strategies to prevent domestic violence. The proclamation calls on all Americans to condemn domestic violence, support survivors, and trust in the efforts of law enforcement and social service providers to hold offenders accountable and prevent future violence.
