Congressman Mark Schauer, a Democrat from Michigan, has voiced his support for a bipartisan plan to extend unemployment benefits and tax cuts for families in Michigan. He believes that with the economy still struggling, it is not the time to raise taxes or remove support for workers who have lost their jobs. Schauer believes that extending these benefits and tax cuts will provide certainty for working families and small businesses, ultimately helping to put people back to work. While he has concerns about proposed changes to the estate tax, he sees this proposal as an important step towards a bipartisan compromise that will help revive the economy.
