The article is a transcript of a press briefing held by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs on February 11, 2009. He starts by making announcements about President Obama's calls to Oklahoma officials regarding tornadoes that struck the state and state transportation officials visiting the White House to discuss infrastructure needs. He then addresses questions about the market reaction to Treasury Secretary Geithner's announcement on the bailout plan, the plan's lack of detail, and the need for transparency and collaboration. Gibbs also discusses the stimulus package, the role of Caterpillar in supporting the package, and the concern about housing. He emphasizes the complexity of the issues and the importance of getting the decisions right for the long-term economic health of the country. The briefing also touches on topics such as Afghanistan, the Israeli election, and the confirmation process for Labor Secretary Hilda Solis. The transcript ends with a question about the Fairness Doctrine, to which Gibbs promises to provide a more detailed answer later.
