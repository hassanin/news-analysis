The Vice President, along with Governor Pritzker, Mayor Lightfoot, and General Raoul, convened to discuss the Dobbs decision by the United States Supreme Court, which took away a constitutional right from women in America. The Vice President emphasized the need to protect a woman's right to make decisions about her own body and stressed the importance of freedom, liberty, self-determination, and bodily autonomy. The leaders discussed individual and collective actions to address this injustice, acknowledging the role of President Biden's executive orders and the leadership of governors like Governor Pritzker in providing healthcare resources and being a safe haven for women from neighboring states. They recognized the need to build coalitions and highlighted the upcoming midterm elections as an opportunity to support candidates who will protect and defend these rights. The Vice President concluded by urging everyone to exercise their right to vote.
