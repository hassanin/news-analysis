First Lady Melania Trump visited the Upbring New Hope Children's Center in McAllen, Texas, which is a social services center for children. She had planned to visit a customs and border patrol processing center as well but was unable to due to severe weather. Mrs. Trump was accompanied by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar. During her visit, she participated in a roundtable discussion with leaders and staff, toured the facility, and spoke with children in their bedrooms, a medical room, and three classrooms. Mrs. Trump expressed her admiration for the center's staff and the children's eagerness to learn. She also emphasized the need for common sense immigration reform that secures borders and keeps families together.
