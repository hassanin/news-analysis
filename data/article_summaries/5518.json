Twenty years ago, President George W. Bush declared that preventing and treating HIV/AIDS was a foreign policy priority for the United States. This led to the creation of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which transformed the global AIDS response and demonstrated America's commitment to countries most impacted by the epidemic. PEPFAR has saved over 25 million lives and significantly improved health outcomes in more than 55 partner countries. AIDS-related deaths have decreased by 68% since 2004, and new HIV infections are down 42%. PEPFAR has also contributed to the prevention of HIV transmission from mother to child, resulting in 5.5 million HIV-free births. Additionally, PEPFAR's investments in partner nations' health systems have helped these countries respond to other health crises such as COVID-19, Mpox, and Ebola. Currently, PEPFAR supports 20.1 million people worldwide with HIV/AIDS treatment, and the Administration aims to continue leading the global HIV/AIDS response. The goal is to end AIDS by 2030, eliminate stigma and barriers to care, and prioritize the voices of people living with HIV/AIDS. The Administration looks forward to working with Congress on PEPFAR's reauthorization this year.
