This article is a Presidential Memorandum issued by President Barack Obama on May 20, 2009, regarding preemption. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of the Federal system in the United States, where both the national government and state governments have significant roles. It acknowledges that state and local governments have often been more proactive in protecting health, safety, and the environment than the national government. However, the memorandum expresses concern about executive departments and agencies preempting state laws without sufficient legal justification. It states that preemption should only occur after careful consideration of the legitimate prerogatives of the states and with a sufficient legal basis. The memorandum provides guidelines for departments and agencies, including not including preemptive statements in regulatory preambles unless they are also included in the codified regulation, and reviewing past regulations to determine if their preemptive statements or provisions are justified. The memorandum concludes by stating that it does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
