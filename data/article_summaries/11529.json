President Obama is traveling to Albany, New York to call on Congress to act on a "To-Do" list that will create jobs and help restore middle-class security. These initiatives have bipartisan support and are aimed at creating an economy built to last and creating secure American jobs. The President will talk about the need to encourage insourcing and provide incentives for businesses to bring jobs back to the United States. The President believes that Congress needs to do more, although they have acted on some important measures. He also discusses gas prices, the new coalition government in Israel, and the issue of gay marriage. The President's personal views on gay marriage are evolving, but he has a firm commitment to the rights of LGBT citizens. The President is pleased with the success of intelligence and counterterrorism officials in foiling an al Qaeda plot. There is no evidence that the explosive device could have evaded airport screeners. The President is unaware of the death of Maurice Sendak, but it is likely that his daughters have read his book.
