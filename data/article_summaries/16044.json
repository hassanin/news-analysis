The article discusses the continuation of the national emergency with respect to North Korea. The national emergency was declared in 2008 due to the existence and risk of weapons-usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula. In 2010, the scope of the national emergency was expanded to address the threat posed by the actions and policies of the North Korean government, including an unprovoked attack on a South Korean navy ship and nuclear and missile tests. Additional steps were taken in 2011 and 2015 to address the national emergency, including import restrictions and measures to address cyber-related actions and human rights abuses. The article states that the national emergency and the measures taken to deal with it must continue beyond June 26, 2015.
