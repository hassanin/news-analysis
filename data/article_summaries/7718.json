In this article, Senator Manchin expresses his preparedness to support a Build Back Better plan that addresses inflation, is fiscally responsible, and promotes job creation. The plan being finalized by the House is said to meet these criteria as it is fully funded, reduces the deficit, and lowers costs for healthcare, childcare, elder care, and housing. The article also mentions that seventeen Nobel Prize-winning economists have endorsed the plan, stating that it will help reduce inflation. Therefore, there is optimism that Senator Manchin will lend his support to the plan.
