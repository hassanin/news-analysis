The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has announced a second phase of grants for the Drug-Free Communities (DFC) Support Program. Approximately $24 million in continued funding will be provided for 192 current DFC Support Program grant recipients across the United States. These grants aim to promote substance use prevention among youth. This funding is in addition to the $42.5 million in support announced last month, with a third phase of funding to be announced later this year. The DFC Program provides grants to community coalitions to address local substance use problems among young people. The program aims to create and sustain a reduction in local youth substance use through engaging multiple sectors of the community and employing various environmental strategies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is partnering with ONDCP and community coalitions to prevent substance use among youth. The DFC grant recipients have consistently shown a reduction in youth substance use rates. As of October 1, 2020, the day-to-day management of the DFC Program is being performed by the CDC National Center for Injury Prevention and Control under an agreement with ONDCP.
