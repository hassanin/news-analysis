President Obama has signed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 into law, which includes some measures to address the opioid epidemic. However, he expressed disappointment that Republicans did not provide sufficient resources for addiction treatment. The President highlighted the urgent need for funding, as 78 Americans die from opioid overdoses every day. He emphasized that his administration has been working to increase access to treatment and will continue to fight for the funding families desperately need. The President called on Republicans to provide adequate funding to address this public health crisis.
