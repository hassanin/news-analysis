President Trump has prioritized advancing the understanding of America's oceans, coastal waters, and Great Lakes. These areas contribute significantly to the economy, supporting ocean-dependent businesses, economic activity, jobs, and wages. The United States Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), which is larger than all fifty states combined, contains valuable natural resources and ecosystems that need to be further explored and studied. President Trump has directed the development of a national strategy to map and explore the U.S. EEZ, as well as recommendations to facilitate permitting for ocean exploration and research. The strategies and recommendations released by the Ocean Policy Committee will guide the national ocean mapping and exploration enterprise and ensure U.S. global leadership in ocean research. The National Strategy for Ocean Mapping, Exploration, and Characterization aims to complete mapping the deep water by 2030 and the nearshore waters by 2040, while the Alaska Coastal Mapping Strategy focuses on modernizing ocean and coastal maps in Alaska. Additionally, President Trump has directed the committee to recommend actions that increase the efficiency of the permitting process for ocean exploration activities. The goal is to reduce duplication, increase coordination, save taxpayer dollars, and protect marine resources. The United States aims to harness cutting-edge science, new technologies, and partnerships to benefit the economy, enhance national security, and promote ocean conservation and stewardship.
