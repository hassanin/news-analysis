The White House has launched the Fair Chance Business Pledge, which aims to eliminate barriers for individuals with a criminal record and provide them with a second chance. The pledge calls on companies to improve their communities by creating pathways for those with a criminal record to access employment, training, and education. 19 companies, including American Airlines, Facebook, Google, PepsiCo, Starbucks, and Uber, have already signed the pledge. Currently, there are approximately 2.2 million Americans behind bars, and around 70 million Americans have some sort of criminal record. This initiative is part of President Obama's efforts to reform the criminal justice system and provide opportunities for those who have paid their debt to society.
