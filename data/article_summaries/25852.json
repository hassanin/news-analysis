The healthcare bill being considered by the Senate would increase spending on Medicaid from $393 billion this year to $464 billion in 2027, adjusting for inflation. Despite this, Democrats are claiming it to be a "cut" to the program. The bill aims to strengthen and reform Medicaid by focusing on the disabled, elderly, pregnant mothers, and their children. It would give states more flexibility to come up with cost-saving and quality-improving innovations, while fixing the flawed incentives that have led to excessive spending. The goal is to ensure that states have the resources they need to protect their vulnerable populations.
