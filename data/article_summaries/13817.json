This memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama, instructs heads of executive departments and agencies to continue adhering to the policy set forth in previous memoranda regarding federal employee pay schedules and rates. The Congress's decision to deny statutory adjustments to pay systems or schedules covering executive branch employees is cited as the reason for this instruction. The memorandum is valid until December 31, 2013, and shall be carried out within the limits of the law and the legal authorities of the departments and agencies. It is important to note that this memorandum does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management is tasked with providing necessary guidance and publishing the memorandum in the Federal Register.
