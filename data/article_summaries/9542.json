President Obama and President Medvedev have agreed to meet in Prague, Czech Republic, on April 8 to sign the New START Treaty. This treaty will further reduce and limit strategic offensive arms between the United States and Russia. The agreement will include limits on deployed warheads, intercontinental ballistic missile launchers, submarine-launched ballistic missile launchers, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear weapons. The verification regime of the treaty will allow for monitoring of all aspects of the agreement. The new treaty demonstrates the commitment of both countries to reduce their nuclear arsenals and strengthen the international non-proliferation regime. This is part of the United States' efforts to reduce the number and role of nuclear weapons globally.
