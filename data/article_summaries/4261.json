The Biden Administration has released additional details about the new international air travel policy requiring foreign travelers to the United States to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Starting on November 8, non-citizen air travelers will need to provide proof of vaccination before boarding a flight to the U.S., with limited exceptions. Unvaccinated travelers will also need to test within one day of departure. The administration has released a Presidential Proclamation, three CDC Orders, and technical instructions to implement these requirements. The new policy aims to enhance the safety of Americans and international air travel. Fully vaccinated foreign nationals will also be allowed to travel across the Northern and Southwest land borders for non-essential reasons starting on November 8. More information on amendments to land border restrictions will be provided soon. Travelers can find full details on the CDC and Department of State websites.
