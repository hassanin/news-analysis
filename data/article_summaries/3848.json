She emphasized the importance of the law's impact on the lives of Americans and highlighted examples of how it is already making a difference, such as in Charlotte, North Carolina, where she witnessed innovation and job growth, and in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where lead pipe removal is improving public health and education. Harris acknowledged that infrastructure work extends beyond roads and bridges, touching on various aspects of American life, including public health and productivity. She emphasized the need for collaboration with leaders at every level and encouraged community engagement to ensure the law's benefits reach all Americans.
