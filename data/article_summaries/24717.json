The White House Council of Economic Advisers has released a report titled "Preparing the Workers of Today for the Jobs of Tomorrow," which outlines the expected growth and development of the U.S. labor market in the coming years. The report discusses the skills and training that will be relevant in growing occupations, as well as the attributes of an education and training system that will equip workers for future jobs. It highlights the shift in economic drivers from sectors like financial services to sectors like healthcare and environmental-related occupations. The report also emphasizes the importance of worker flexibility and the need for workers with greater analytical and interactive skills. Additionally, CEA Chair Christina Romer will participate in a live video chat on Facebook and WhiteHouse.gov to answer questions from the public.
