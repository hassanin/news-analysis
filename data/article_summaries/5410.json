Yesterday, Vice President Harris held a meeting with small business owners as part of Hispanic Heritage Month. The participants were from a variety of industries, including food, clothing, and environmental science. They expressed gratitude for the Administration's support and emphasized the importance of continued partnership. The Vice President pledged to continue supporting small businesses and highlighted efforts to secure investments for community banks, which are crucial for minority, women, and rural small businesses. The participants also discussed their role as civic leaders and sources of information in their communities, which the Vice President acknowledged and encouraged. The Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized support for small businesses through initiatives like the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill. They have also focused on breaking down barriers for minority-owned small businesses, such as increasing access to capital and federal contracts. Vice President Harris has consistently prioritized small businesses and entrepreneurs, meeting with Latina small business owners last year and Latino leaders in Milwaukee last month. Following the meeting, the Vice President hosted a reception at the Naval Observatory to celebrate the accomplishments of small business owners.
