The President has signed H.R. 325, also known as the "No Budget, No Pay Act of 2013." This law temporarily suspends the public debt limit until May 18, 2013. It also requires that payments for compensation of Members of Congress be deposited in an escrow account starting April 16, 2013, unless the House has passed a budget resolution for FY 2014.
