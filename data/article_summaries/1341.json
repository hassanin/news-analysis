Yesterday, the White House Community Violence Intervention (CVI) Collaborative held a meeting to discuss the use of American Rescue Plan funding to strengthen community violence intervention infrastructure. The Collaborative consists of 16 jurisdictions committed to scaling up evidence-based community violence interventions to reduce gun violence. Participants in the meeting included mayors, law enforcement leaders, CVI experts, philanthropic institutions, and training and technical assistance providers. The Collaborative aims to enhance partnerships and coordination, facilitate peer-to-peer learning, and support effective community-based public safety strategies. The meeting emphasized the urgency of addressing gun violence and allocating resources to community-based organizations that serve Black, Brown, and marginalized communities. Mayor Melvin Carter of St. Paul, Minnesota highlighted the success of evidence-based community violence interventions in his community. The White House staff also shared updates on other administration efforts to support CVI, such as guidance from the Department of Housing and Urban Development on using Community Development Block Grant funds for CVI strategies and new awards from the National Institute of Health for CVI research and implementation projects.
