Des Moines Mayor, T.M. Franklin Cownie, has expressed his support for President Obama's tax cuts for America's middle class. He commended the President for his leadership in securing these tax cuts, extending unemployment benefits, and providing tax incentives for small businesses. Mayor Cownie believes that preventing tax rates from rising for the middle class and implementing a payroll tax reduction will help put more money into family budgets. He acknowledges that while these benefits were not extended to the wealthiest individuals in order to avoid worsening the federal deficit, it is important to provide relief for the middle class now. Mayor Cownie believes that President Obama has demonstrated his leadership by putting together an economic package that the country desperately needs.
