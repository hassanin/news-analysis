President Biden has declared a major disaster in the State of Washington due to flooding and mudslides that occurred from November 13 to November 15, 2021. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. Federal funding will be made available to individuals and businesses in the counties of Clallam, Skagit, and Whatcom, as well as the Lummi Nation, Nooksack Indian Tribe, and Quileute Tribe. Assistance may include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for property losses, and other recovery programs. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also receive federal funding on a cost-sharing basis. Toney Raines has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. Residents and business owners in the designated counties can apply for assistance online or by phone. The toll-free telephone numbers will be available seven days a week from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. (local time). For further information, media should contact the FEMA News Desk.
