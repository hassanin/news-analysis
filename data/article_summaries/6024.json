President Biden is taking a strong stance against antisemitism in America. He is forming an inter-agency group to coordinate efforts to counter antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of bias and discrimination within the country. The group's first task is to develop a national strategy to combat antisemitism, which will include raising awareness about the issue, addressing online and offline harassment, preventing attacks, and promoting efforts to counter antisemitism and create a more inclusive society. The President is seeking collaboration with advocates, civil rights leaders, civil society, and members of Congress to tackle this problem.
