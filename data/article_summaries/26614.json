The Department of Justice plans to vigorously defend President Trump's travel restrictions, which were issued in a proclamation after an extensive security review. The restrictions are based on countries' inability or unwillingness to share critical information for vetting applications, as well as concerns related to terrorism and national security. The Department of Justice is confident that the judiciary will ultimately uphold the President's action and restore protections for the safety of the American people.
