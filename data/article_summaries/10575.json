On the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture, the White House issued a statement pledging to work towards the elimination of torture and all forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The United States rejects torture as unlawful and inconsistent with universal rights and freedoms. The country does not practice or condone torture, and it does not transfer individuals to countries where they would be subjected to it. The United States works with international partners, enforces strong domestic laws, provides training for law enforcement and military personnel, and reviews interrogation, detention, and transfer practices to end torture. The statement also mentions support for efforts like the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture. The United States recognizes that there is still much work to be done to eliminate torture globally, and it will continue to seek an end to cruel and inhuman treatment.
