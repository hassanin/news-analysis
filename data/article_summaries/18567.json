The Obama Administration has announced plans to hold a Forum on Workplace Flexibility at the White House on March 31st. The President and First Lady will discuss the importance of creating workplace practices that allow workers to balance the demands of their jobs and the needs of their families. The forum will bring together labor leaders, CEOs, small business owners, and policy experts to share their ideas and strategies for making the workplace more flexible. The goal is to ensure that working Americans do not have to choose between their careers and meeting the needs of their families. More details about the forum will be announced soon.
