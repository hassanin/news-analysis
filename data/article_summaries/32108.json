President Donald J. Trump has authorized an increase in federal funding for disaster assistance to the Santa Clara Pueblo. This funding is for Public Assistance projects that were undertaken as a result of flooding that occurred from August 19 to August 24, 2011. The increase in federal funding raises the Federal share for Public Assistance from 75 percent to 90 percent of the total eligible costs for the Santa Clara Pueblo.
