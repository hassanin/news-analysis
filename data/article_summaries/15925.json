The article is a message from President Barack Obama to the Senate regarding the bilateral tax agreement with Hungary. The President is requesting the Senate's advice and consent for the ratification of the Convention between the United States and Hungary for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income. The proposed Convention was signed on February 4, 2010, in Budapest. The President highlights that the new agreement aims to bring U.S.-Hungary tax treaty relations in line with current U.S. tax treaty policies. It includes provisions to address "treaty shopping," which refers to the inappropriate use of a tax treaty by residents of a third country. The President emphasizes that the existing Convention with Hungary, signed in 1979, lacks treaty shopping protections and has been abused by third-country investors. The Department of the Treasury's tax treaty program considers concluding the proposed Convention as a top priority. President Obama recommends that the Senate gives early and favorable consideration to the proposed Convention and related agreement and provides its advice and consent for ratification.
