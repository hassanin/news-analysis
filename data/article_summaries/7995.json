The Biden-Harris Administration is prioritizing drought resilience and water security in the Western United States through their Investing in America agenda. They have allocated $15.4 billion, the largest investment in climate resilience in the country's history, to enhance the region's ability to cope with the ongoing megadrought and climate change. Senior officials from the White House and the Department of the Interior recently visited Arizona, California, Colorado, and Nevada to highlight these investments and collaborate with stakeholders.

The Administration is announcing new investments in water-saving projects and conservation efforts in the Colorado River Basin, which will immediately result in significant water savings. These savings will continue to increase as long-term water efficiency infrastructure and resilience strategies are implemented. The Colorado River Basin is a vital water source for over 40 million Americans, supports hydropower resources in eight states, and is crucial for agricultural communities and 30 Tribal Nations. However, due to the historic 23-year drought, water levels at Lake Powell and Lake Mead have reached record lows, despite recent rainfall and snow.

To address the water demand in the Colorado River Basin, the Administration is supporting voluntary water conservation measures through the Inflation Reduction Act. The act includes $4.6 billion for drought resilience and short-term conservation efforts. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law also allocates $8.3 billion to improve the water infrastructure programs of the Bureau of Reclamation. These investments will fund infrastructure upgrades, water efficiency improvements, storage, recycling, and reuse initiatives to make the limited water supply more sustainable.

In addition to financial investments, the Biden-Harris Administration is working collaboratively with all stakeholders to protect communities in the Colorado River Basin. They aim to provide farmers, ranchers, Tribal Nations, rural communities, and cities with the necessary tools and resources to manage the impacts of drought and changing climate conditions. The goal is to ensure water security and resilience in the region now and in the future.
