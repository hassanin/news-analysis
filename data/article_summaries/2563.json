President Biden will sign an Executive Order to prioritize American manufacturing and innovation. The order aims to ensure that inventions resulting from federal funding are manufactured in the United States, benefiting American workers and communities. The order focuses on four core objectives: improving transparency and streamlining reporting requirements in the federal R&D process, boosting incentives for manufacturing inventions developed using federal funds, expanding domestic production for critical industries while maintaining international partnerships, and making the domestic manufacturing waiver process clearer and more consistent. The order aligns with Biden's goal of mobilizing private sector investment, supporting research and development, and creating new jobs.
