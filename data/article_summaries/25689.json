In a Presidential Memorandum issued on September 9, 2020, the President determined that the continuation of certain authorities under the Trading With the Enemy Act with respect to Cuba is in the national interest of the United States. These authorities are scheduled to expire on September 14, 2020, but will now be extended for one year until September 14, 2021. The Secretary of the Treasury is directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
