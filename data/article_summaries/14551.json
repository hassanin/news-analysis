Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar, and U.S. Senator Tom Carper visited the University of Delaware to emphasize the importance of renewable energy development on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), specifically offshore wind resources. President Obama had recently announced that the Interior Department had finalized regulations for renewable energy production on the OCS. These regulations aim to unlock the country's offshore renewable resources and promote a clean energy future. The National Renewable Energy Lab has identified significant wind potential off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Delaware has a wind power production capacity that can power 1.2 to 1.5 million homes. The state has set a target for 20% of its electricity to come from renewable sources by 2019 and has signed a power purchase agreement for an offshore wind facility. The Interior Department's Minerals Management Service is evaluating a proposal for a meteorological data collection project that could support future wind energy development. The new regulations provide a framework for states to pursue renewable energy projects on federal submerged lands and include revenue-sharing provisions with adjacent coastal states. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 granted the Interior's Minerals Management Service the authority to regulate renewable energy development on the OCS, and these rules are the first significant action taken under that authority. The Interior Department and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have clarified their agencies' jurisdictional responsibilities for leasing and licensing renewable energy projects on the OCS.
