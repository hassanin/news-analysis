President Trump's 2020 Budget, titled "A Budget for a Better America," aims to invest in national priorities while reducing spending and balancing the budget in 15 years. The budget includes a 5 percent cut to non-defense discretionary spending, reduces deficits by over $2.7 trillion over 10 years, and focuses on eliminating wasteful, duplicative, and ineffective programs. The goal is to bring accountability and responsibility to federal agencies and departments and address Washington's spending addiction. The budget reinforces pro-growth policies that have led to job growth and prosperity in the country. The op-ed calls on Congress to work with the president and curb excessive spending.
