This week, Congressional Democrats and Congressional Republicans have shown contrasting approaches to women's health. House Democrats passed the Women's Health Protection Act and Ensuring Access to Abortion Act, aiming to ensure women's access to healthcare services regardless of their location and protect their right to seek medical care across state lines. These bills have support from a majority of Americans. However, every Republican voted against the bill to safeguard women's right to choose, and most House Republicans also opposed the right to travel for medical care. Senate Republicans similarly blocked a comparable bill. This opposition is seen as extreme and disconnected from public opinion.
