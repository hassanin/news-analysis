The Presidential Memorandum from March 13, 2014, addresses the need to update and modernize overtime regulations in the United States. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) currently provides wage protections, including overtime pay, for American workers. However, exemptions from overtime requirements for executive, administrative, and professional employees (known as "white collar" exemptions) have not kept up with the modern economy. As a result, millions of Americans are lacking overtime protections and even the right to the minimum wage. The memorandum directs the Secretary of Labor to propose revisions to the existing overtime regulations to modernize and streamline them. The goal is to update existing protections, address the changing nature of the workplace, and simplify the regulations for both workers and businesses. The memorandum clarifies that it does not create any legally enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or its entities. The Secretary of Labor is authorized and directed to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
