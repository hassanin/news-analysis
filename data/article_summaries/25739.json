On July 20, 2017, President Donald J. Trump welcomed the CEOs of Corning, Merck, and Pfizer pharmaceutical companies to the White House to announce a new pharmaceutical glass packaging initiative. The three companies have joined forces to bring pharmaceutical glass manufacturing back to the United States through modernization and innovation. This partnership will result in a $4 billion investment and the creation of more than 4,000 new high-tech jobs in the coming years. Corning has developed a technology called "Valor Glass" for the storage and delivery of injectable drugs. The initial investment will cover the expansion of Corning facilities and the construction of a new manufacturing plant in the Southeast. Previously, 98% of the $4 billion industry had been done overseas, making this initiative a significant step in American employment and technology advancement. The return of pharmaceutical glass manufacturing to the United States was made possible through collaboration between the three companies and support from the Trump Administration. The event took place as part of the White House's Made in America Week.
