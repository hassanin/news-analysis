President Barack Obama has transmitted an alternative plan for monthly basic pay increases for members of the uniformed services for 2017. He is committed to supporting the uniformed service members but also recognizes the need to keep the nation on a sustainable fiscal course. As a result, he has determined that the 2017 monthly basic pay increase will be set at 1.6 percent. This decision is consistent with his fiscal year 2017 Budget and will not materially affect the federal government's ability to attract and retain well-qualified members for the uniformed services. The adjustments will take effect on January 1, 2017.
