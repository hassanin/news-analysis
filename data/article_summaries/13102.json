The President of the United States issued a statement on the one-year anniversary of the Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The statement highlights the success of the deal in rolling back Iran's nuclear program and making the world safer. Iran has fulfilled its commitments under the deal, as verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). It has shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium, dismantled two-thirds of its centrifuges, and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. The IAEA reports have confirmed Iran's compliance with its commitments, ensuring that all pathways to a nuclear weapon remain closed and extending Iran's breakout time from two to three months to about a year. The United States and its partners have also lifted nuclear-related sanctions as agreed upon in the deal. The statement emphasizes that the JCPOA is a demonstration of the success of principled diplomacy and a commitment to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. While there are still differences with Iran, the United States and the world are more secure because of the JCPOA.
