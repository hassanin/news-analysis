In a teleconference, senior administration officials announced that President Biden intends to sign a new executive order to strengthen U.S. sanctions against Russia. The focus of the executive order is on financial facilitators for Russia's war in Ukraine. The goal is to disrupt Russia's military industrial base and prevent it from increasing its military capacity. The executive order will allow the U.S. to target financial institutions that support Russia's military industrial complex. The officials emphasized that these actions are part of a broader strategy to support Ukraine against Russia's aggression. The U.S. is also urging Congress to pass supplemental funding for Ukraine. The officials stated that the executive order aligns with the actions taken by the EU and the UK. They also mentioned that American and European financial institutions are not currently in violation but will be informed about the importance of preventing the movement of goods that support Russia's military industrial base. The executive order is scheduled to be signed by President Biden the following day. There was also mention of ongoing discussions regarding seizing Russian bank assets to help Ukraine cover the cost of the war.
