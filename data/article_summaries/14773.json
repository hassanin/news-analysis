This article is a notice from the White House regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Lebanon. The President declared a national emergency in 2007 due to the actions of certain individuals undermining Lebanon's government and democratic institutions. Ongoing activities, such as arms transfers to Hizballah, continue to threaten the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, the national emergency will continue for another year.
