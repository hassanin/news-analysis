The White House held an event called "Taking Action: Creating Model Emergency Management Plans for Schools, Institutions of Higher Education, and Houses of Worship" as part of the President's plan to reduce gun violence. The event aimed to gather feedback from stakeholders in order to develop model emergency management plans for these locations. Over 100 leaders from various fields, including faith, education, law enforcement, and mental health, participated in the event. The discussions focused on lessons learned from previous mass shootings and what should be included in the model plans. The event was moderated by Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, and FBI Executive Assistant Director Richard McFeely.
