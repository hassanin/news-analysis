During a press briefing, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster discussed the U.S. airstrikes on Syria in response to the recent chemical weapons attack. Tillerson stated that the U.S. has high confidence that the chemical attacks were carried out by the Assad regime and that Russia failed in its responsibility to secure and destroy Syria's chemical weapons. He also emphasized the importance of taking action to prevent the normalization of chemical weapon use. McMaster added that the strike targeted the airfield responsible for the chemical attack and was aimed at reducing Assad's ability to carry out further attacks. The officials stated that there were no prior contacts with Russia regarding the strike, but the U.S. followed established de-confliction protocols to reduce the risk of Russian casualties. They also mentioned that the strike does not indicate a change in U.S. policy or military activities in Syria, but rather a response to a specific incident.
