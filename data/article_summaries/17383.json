President Barack Obama has proclaimed September 11 through September 17, 2011, as National Health Information Technology Week in the United States. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of secure and efficient health information systems in improving healthcare delivery. Health information technology, such as electronic health records and electronic prescriptions, can help doctors and patients make safer and smarter decisions about healthcare. It also enables coordination between providers and patients, reduces the risk of dangerous drug interactions, and facilitates access to prevention and disease management services. The proclamation highlights the successful use of technology in coordinating and improving care for the Armed Forces and veterans. Furthermore, the proclamation highlights the need to ensure the security of health information records and mentions the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which promotes the use of Health IT while strengthening patient privacy laws and providing financial incentives to professionals and hospitals that adopt electronic health records. The proclamation encourages individuals to play a role in improving the healthcare system by working with their doctors to access information about their care. It also emphasizes the importance of putting patients and their families at the center of their own care and empowering them to reach their health goals. President Obama calls for increased adoption and meaningful use of Health IT and encourages Americans to visit HealthIT.gov to learn more about its benefits.
