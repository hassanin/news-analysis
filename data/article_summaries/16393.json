The White House has released a statement from the President praising Chairman Miller for introducing an education reform bill. The bill aims to cut giveaways to special interests, invest in children's future, and save taxpayers' money. It seeks to end wasteful subsidies given to banks and private lenders for student loans and make college more affordable by increasing Pell Grants to keep pace with inflation. The legislation also aims to simplify financial aid forms, increase graduation rates, and help the President's goal of graduating five million more Americans from community colleges by 2020. It includes the largest investment in community colleges in fifty years, with a focus on increasing completion rates, strengthening ties with businesses, modernizing facilities, and offering online learning opportunities. Additionally, the bill aims to invest in high-quality early education and includes $10 billion for early learning challenge grants. The President is proud that the legislation not only pays for itself but also saves taxpayers money and reduces the deficit. He expresses his commitment to working with the Chairman and Congress to strengthen the bill and pass it before the end of the year.
