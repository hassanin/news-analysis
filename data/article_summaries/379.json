President Biden held a roundtable discussion with farmers, ranchers, an independent poultry processor, and members of his Cabinet to address the need for more competition in beef, pork, and poultry processing. The Administration announced its Action Plan for a Fairer, More Competitive, and More Resilient Meat and Poultry Supply Chain. The President emphasized the importance of addressing the lack of competition in agricultural markets and the negative impact it has on farmers, ranchers, and consumers. Secretary Vilsack outlined a $1 billion investment from the American Rescue Plan to support independent processing projects and increase options for farmers and ranchers. The Department of Agriculture will collaborate with the Department of Justice to enforce federal laws and protect consumers. Participants in the roundtable shared their experiences of how limited competition in the meat and poultry supply chain affects their businesses and communities. The independent poultry processor discussed the challenges faced due to restrictive contracts imposed by large integrated companies. The attendees highlighted the importance of funding and support for independent processing operations to promote competition and provide more options for producers and consumers. Attorney General Garland encouraged participants to use a new joint web portal to report possible anticompetitive practices. President Biden reiterated the Administration's commitment to addressing competition issues across industries.
