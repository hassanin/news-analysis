President Biden has authorized an increase in federal funding for disaster assistance in Kentucky due to severe storms, winds, flooding, and tornadoes that occurred starting on December 10, 2021. Under the major disaster declaration, federal funding was initially set at 75% of eligible costs for emergency work, hazard mitigation, and other needs assistance. However, the President's order today increases federal funds for debris removal and emergency protective measures to 100% of eligible costs for a 30-day period.
