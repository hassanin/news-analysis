According to a recent article from The Associated Press, the number of job openings in the US has risen to nearly 7.6 million, close to a record high. This increase in job openings has led to a situation where there are roughly 1 million more job openings than there are unemployed individuals. This is the first time in the 18 years that this data has been tracked that openings have surpassed the number of unemployed. The article also notes that hiring has increased and more people are quitting their jobs, which is seen as a positive sign for the economy. The strong job market has also resulted in faster wage growth, with hourly wages rising at the fastest pace in nine years in February. The article suggests that these trends indicate a strong job market and support expectations of faster economic growth in the coming months.
