On Child Health Day, President Barack Obama issued a proclamation emphasizing the importance of ensuring the health and well-being of children. He highlighted the Affordable Care Act, which prevents insurance companies from denying coverage to children with pre-existing conditions and allows young adults to stay on their parents' health insurance plan until age 26. The administration also takes action to address bullying in schools and combat childhood obesity through the Let's Move! initiative led by First Lady Michelle Obama. The proclamation also emphasizes the need for a safe environment for children, including clean water and air quality. Child Health Day is observed on the first Monday of October, as designated by a joint resolution by Congress in 1928. The proclamation calls upon families, health professionals, community organizations, and all levels of government to prioritize the health of America's children.
