President Biden spoke at a press conference about the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act by the House of Representatives. He called it a "once-in-a-generation investment" that will create millions of jobs and modernize the country's infrastructure. The bill will invest in roads, bridges, broadband, public transit, and more. It will also address climate change and create a national network of charging stations for electric vehicles. The President emphasized that the bill is fiscally responsible and fully paid for by making the wealthiest Americans and corporations pay their fair share of taxes. He also expressed confidence that the Build Back Better Act, which focuses on social and economic issues, will pass in the House and Senate. The President highlighted the challenges facing the country, including the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions, and emphasized his commitment to helping Americans through these difficult times. He urged the American people to have faith in their ability to overcome challenges and build a better future.
