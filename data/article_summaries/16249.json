President Obama announced the launch of the Office of Public Engagement, which will serve as the front door to the White House for ordinary Americans to participate and inform the work of the President. The office, previously known as the Office of Public Liaison, will focus on engaging Americans and increasing their meaningful engagement with the federal government. It will allow ordinary Americans to offer their stories and ideas on issues such as health care, energy, and education. The office will also have a strong online presence, including blog postings and other interactive elements. The President also announced the release of the Citizens' Briefing Book, which contains ideas submitted by everyday Americans on dealing with the nation's toughest issues. The leadership team of the Office of Public Engagement includes Valerie Jarrett, Senior Adviser to the President, Christina M. Tchen, Director of OPE, and Michael Strautmanis, Chief of Staff to the Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Relations and Public Engagement.
