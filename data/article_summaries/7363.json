He called the tornado outbreak one of the largest in history and expressed his condolences to those who lost loved ones or were affected by the storms.

President Biden also mentioned that he plans to visit the affected areas and will ask Congress for additional disaster relief funding if needed. When asked about the role of climate change in the intensity of the storms, the President acknowledged the impact of climate change on weather patterns but couldn't give a specific assessment of its influence on these specific tornadoes. He emphasized the importance of prioritizing the rescue and recovery efforts and expressed his concern for those who are still missing and the anxiety of their loved ones. The President also discussed the need for better preparedness and action on climate change to mitigate future disasters. Finally, he addressed a question on the situation in Ukraine, stating that U.S. ground combat troops were not on the table but that the economic consequences for Russia and the support for Ukraine would be significant if Russia were to move further into Ukraine.
