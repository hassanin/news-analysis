The article is a message from the White House regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the situation in Zimbabwe. The President states that certain members of the Government of Zimbabwe and other individuals are undermining the country's democratic processes and institutions, posing a threat to the United States' foreign policy. As a result, the President has determined that it is necessary to maintain the sanctions in place to respond to this threat. However, the United States is open to modifying the targeted sanctions if those involved demonstrate a commitment to the rule of law, democracy, and human rights. The United States will continue to review the sanctions list to ensure it remains current and addresses the concerns for which it was created. The ultimate goal is to see a peaceful and democratic Zimbabwe.
