The pending tax cut legislation in the US will eliminate the federal income tax burden on the average American family earning $59,000 a year and halve the tax bill for the average family earning $75,000. It will also allow the majority of small businesses to protect nearly one-quarter of their income from taxes. However, despite these benefits, the media coverage of the bill has focused on claims that it is a gift to the rich and a budget buster. This overlooks the provisions in the bill to double the standard deduction, double the child tax credit, and eliminate the 15 percent tax bracket in favor of a vastly expanded 12 percent rate. It also overlooks the new 23 percent tax deduction for small businesses earning less than $500,000 a year. The tax bill aims to bring relief to hardworking taxpayers who have been affected by the slow growth of the economy. It is expected to increase paychecks for ordinary employees and jump-start local economies by stimulating local investment, consumption, and job creation. The author argues that the tax bill is a Christmas gift for ordinary Americans, small businesses, and local economies, and calls for its immediate passage.
