The Biden-Harris administration has announced a series of actions to lower energy costs for families as winter approaches. This includes providing $4.5 billion in funding to states, territories, and tribes through the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to help cover home heating costs, settle unpaid utility bills, and make cost-effective home energy repairs. Additionally, $8.5 billion will be allocated to support up to 1.6 million households in upgrading homes and apartments to lower energy bills, including installing heat pumps and conducting deep building retrofits. These measures aim to cut home energy costs and help households afford energy-efficient equipment for future savings. Various local news outlets have covered the distribution of funding to different states, highlighting the benefits and assistance provided to low-income families.
