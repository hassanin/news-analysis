President Obama has expressed gratitude to the House of Representatives for passing legislation that includes two key initiatives aimed at helping small businesses in America. The Small Business Lending Fund will provide community banks with capital and incentives to ensure that small businesses can access the loans they need. The State Small Business Credit Initiative aims to support state partnerships in meeting the credit needs of small businesses and manufacturers. The President is also pleased that this legislation is part of a larger package of small business jobs proposals, which includes the elimination of capital gains taxes on small business investments. President Obama recognizes the efforts of Chairman Barney Frank, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, Chairman Sandy Levin, and Chairwoman Nydia Vel√°zquez in supporting America's small businesses and urges the Senate to act quickly to pass these initiatives into law.
