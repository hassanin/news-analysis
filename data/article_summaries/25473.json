President Donald J. Trump has signed an Executive Order to eliminate the bureaucratic red tape associated with environmental reviews and permitting for major infrastructure projects. The Order aims to streamline the process and reduce the time it takes for the Federal Government to process environmental documents from a decade to two years. The Executive Order also requires Federal agencies to track their progress and face penalties for poor performance. The goal is to ensure more timely and efficient infrastructure investment, strengthen the economy, create jobs, and reduce costs for families.
