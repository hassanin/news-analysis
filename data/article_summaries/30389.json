President Donald J. Trump recently addressed the issue of drug addiction and the opioid crisis in the United States. He declared a nationwide public health emergency and the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis has submitted its final report with recommendations on how the Federal Government can address these issues. The Administration is grateful for the Commission's work and will review their recommendations as they continue to work towards reducing drug demand and the opioid crisis.
