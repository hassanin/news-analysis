In this press gaggle, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and Special Assistant to the President for Economic Policy Brian Deese discuss the President's visit to Michigan. They highlight the success of the auto industry since the President took office, with all three major automakers reporting an operating profit for the first time since 2004. They also discuss the need for further economic growth and job creation, particularly through tax cuts for small businesses. The administration acknowledges the challenges posed by the recession and the headwinds from Europe's economic crisis. They emphasize the importance of the decisions made to save the auto industry and the need for continued investment in new industries and technologies. The press secretary also addresses questions about changes in the Office of Management and Budget leadership and responds to criticisms of the government's involvement in the auto industry. The administration hopes to recoup the $60 billion investment in the auto industry made by the Obama administration and is working to ensure taxpayers are not on the hook.
