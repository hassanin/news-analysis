President Obama has already enacted eight different tax cuts for small businesses, including a new tax credit for healthcare insurance, a tax credit for hiring unemployed workers, and additional depreciation incentives for new investments. He intends to enact eight more tax cuts that would benefit millions of small businesses, including a complete exemption from capital gains taxes on key investments, higher deduction limits for business expenses, and deductions for healthcare expenses and cell phone usage. The President argues that his tax cuts would directly benefit real small businesses, while criticizing Republicans for pushing for tax cuts for high-income taxpayers instead. He has called on Congress to pass the Small Business Jobs Bill, which includes the aforementioned tax cuts, as well as measures to support small businesses in accessing credit.
