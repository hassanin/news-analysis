During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki highlighted several updates and announcements. She mentioned that the Department of Transportation awarded $12.6 million in grants to nine marine highway projects across the country as part of the President's Port Action Plan. Psaki also discussed the successful first step of the Port Action Plan, which provided funding to the Port of Savannah to set up container yards and improve the flow of goods. Additionally, she mentioned that the cost of shipping a container between Asia and the West Coast has decreased by over 25% in the past three months, which should result in lower costs for consumers. Psaki also provided a preview of the week ahead, mentioning that the President will award the Medal of Honor to three Army soldiers for acts of gallantry and intrepidity. She also discussed the administration's response to the Supreme Court ruling on the Texas abortion law, the latest on inflation, and other topics such as Julian Assange, Russia, and student loan payments.
