This Presidential Memorandum, issued on August 7, 2020, discusses the extension of the use of the National Guard to respond to COVID-19 and facilitate economic recovery. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of cooperation between the Federal Government and the States in combating the spread of COVID-19 and supporting areas where the threat has been mitigated. It acknowledges the critical support provided by activated National Guard forces in addressing the needs of vulnerable populations, such as those in nursing homes and assisted living facilities. The memorandum directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to fund an additional 25% of emergency assistance activities in California, on top of the existing 75% Federal cost share, to maximize support for the state. This additional cost share will be available until September 30, 2020, and covers duty necessary to comply with health protection protocols. The memorandum includes general provisions stating that it does not impair existing authorities or create any enforceable rights or benefits. The Secretary of Defense is authorized to publish the memorandum in the Federal Register.
