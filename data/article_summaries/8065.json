Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at the AFL-CIO Headquarters in Washington, D.C., announcing the Biden-Harris Lead Pipe and Paint Action Plan. She emphasized the importance of protecting workers' rights to organize and collectively bargain, stating that the administration will be the most pro-labor union administration in American history. Harris highlighted the dangers of lead exposure, particularly for children, and the need to remove lead pipes and paint from homes, schools, and childcare facilities. The plan aims to significantly accelerate the removal of lead infrastructure over the next 10 years, with a focus on historically marginalized communities. The EPA will allocate $2.9 billion in funding for lead service line replacement in 2022, and the American Rescue Plan funds can also be used for this purpose. Harris emphasized the creation of good union jobs and the economic benefits of lead remediation. The Build Back Better Act will allocate $9 billion for lead remediation in low-income communities, Native communities, communities of color, schools, childcare facilities, and nearly $1 billion for rural communities. Harris concluded by calling for the AFL-CIO's help to make homes, schools, and workplaces safe from lead exposure.
