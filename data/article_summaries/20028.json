The White House issued a memorandum on February 5, 2009, regarding appliance efficiency standards. Under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, the Department of Energy (DOE) is required to establish energy efficiency standards for residential and commercial products. The DOE had not met the deadlines specified in the act, which led to a lawsuit in 2005. In 2006, the DOE entered into a consent decree to publish final rules regarding 22 product categories by specific deadlines. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 directed the DOE to establish energy standards for additional product categories. The memorandum requests the DOE to take necessary steps to finalize efficiency standards as soon as possible and in compliance with all deadlines. The DOE should prioritize standards that will result in the greatest energy savings and quantify the expected annual energy savings. The memorandum does not create any enforceable rights or benefits.
