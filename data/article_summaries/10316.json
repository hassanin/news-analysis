The article is about an executive order signed by President Barack Obama in April 2015. The order is titled "Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities" and declares a national emergency to deal with the increasing threat of cyber attacks originating from outside the United States. The order allows the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, to block the property and interests of persons involved in cyber-enabled activities that pose a significant threat to national security, foreign policy, or the economy of the United States. It also prohibits the making of donations to such persons and suspends entry into the United States of individuals who meet the criteria set forth in the order. The order includes provisions to prevent evasion or avoidance of the prohibitions and grants the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to take necessary actions to carry out the order. The Secretary is also authorized to submit reports to Congress on the national emergency declared in the order.
