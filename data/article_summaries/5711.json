The Biden-Harris administration is announcing new initiatives to promote responsible innovation and mitigate the risks associated with artificial intelligence (AI). They have released a Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and an AI Risk Management Framework, providing guidelines for companies and policymakers to mitigate AI risks. The federal government will leverage existing authorities to protect people and hold companies accountable. The administration is investing an additional $140 million to establish seven new National AI Research Institutes, bringing the total to 25 institutes with $500 million in funding. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will issue clear policy guidance on the use of AI by the federal government. The administration will meet with CEOs of major AI companies to discuss the risks and responsibilities associated with AI development. These companies have committed to participating in an independent evaluation of their AI systems at a hacker convention. The administration emphasizes the need for international cooperation on AI standards. The OMB guidance for federal agencies will be released for comment in the summer. The administration acknowledges the broad range of risks associated with AI, including safety and security risks, civil rights risks, privacy risks, risks to trust in democracy, and risks to jobs and the economy. The administration encourages federal employees to use AI responsibly to serve the public interest. The evaluation of AI systems at the hacker convention is an important first step, and the administration will disclose any issues discovered to the companies for mitigation. The evaluation will be similar to red-teaming exercises in cybersecurity. The administration will release a readout of the meeting with AI company CEOs.
