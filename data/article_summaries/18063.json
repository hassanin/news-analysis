This article is a transcript of a press gaggle by Press Secretary Jay Carney. Carney discusses President Obama's visit to Colorado to be briefed on the response to the wildfires, but does not provide specific details about the schedule. He also comments on the European leaders' deal to address the economic crisis, stating that progress has been made but more details need to be worked out. Carney addresses questions about the Supreme Court's ruling on the Affordable Care Act, stating that the penalty for not having health insurance is not a tax and only affects 1% of the population. He also mentions that the President's position is to extend the Bush tax cuts for the middle class but not for the wealthiest Americans. Carney dismisses the contempt vote against Attorney General Eric Holder as pure politics and states that the Justice Department does not pursue prosecution in a contempt case when executive privilege has been asserted. He also discusses the upcoming meeting in Geneva on Syria and expresses hope that it can be a turning point in the crisis. Finally, Carney mentions the transportation and student loan bill, stating that the President looks forward to signing it, and addresses criticisms of the President's visit to Colorado during the wildfires.
