President Obama hosted over 200 bipartisan mayors during their annual U.S. Conference of Mayors (USCM) Winter Meeting. The President discussed ways to partner with cities to raise wages and incomes, strengthen working families, and expand the middle class. The mayors discussed various priority issues such as trade, manufacturing, veterans homelessness, paid sick leave, climate change, affordable healthcare, workforce development, education, My Brother's Keeper, and immigration. Mayors are making progress in advanced manufacturing and tech innovation, implementing the President's executive actions on immigration, expanding early childhood education, ending veterans homelessness, raising the minimum wage, addressing climate change, and promoting the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, over 100 mayors have taken on the President's My Brother's Keeper Community Challenge to increase opportunities for all young people.
