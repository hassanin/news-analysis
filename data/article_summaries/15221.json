President Obama has signed a proclamation designating Chimney Rock as a National Monument. Located in the San Juan National Forest in Colorado, Chimney Rock is a site rich in history and Native American culture. The designation was made with bipartisan support and aims to protect the site and promote tourism and economic benefits for the local economy. The 4,726 acre monument will be managed by the USDA Forest Service in collaboration with various partners. Chimney Rock is home to ruins built by the Ancestral Pueblo People and has significant astronomical alignments. This is the third National Monument designated by President Obama using the Antiquities Act. The designation aligns with the America's Great Outdoors initiative, which focuses on conservation and responding to the priorities of the American people.
