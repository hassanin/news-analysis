The President of the United States, along with leaders from 20 countries, gathered at the Los Angeles Convention Center to launch the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection. The declaration aims to transform the approach to managing migration in the Americas by addressing challenges and responsibilities shared by all nations. The declaration is built on four core pillars: stability and assistance, increasing pathways for legal migration and refugee protection, implementing humane and coordinated border management systems, and responding to emergencies. The President emphasized the importance of safe, orderly, and legal migration and the need to halt dangerous and unlawful migration. The United States is providing economic support to countries in the region and expanding opportunities for legal migration, such as resettling refugees and launching programs to bring in seasonal agricultural workers. The Department of Homeland Security is leading a campaign to disrupt human smuggling in the region, with joint operations between Mexico and the United States. The President acknowledged that there is still much work to be done and encouraged more countries to join the Los Angeles Declaration. President Lasso of Ecuador also spoke at the event.
