This presidential memorandum, issued on November 19, 2019, directs various government agencies to focus on ocean mapping, exploration, and characterization in order to safeguard future prosperity, health, and national security. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of data and information about the ocean in advancing various interests such as maritime commerce, seafood production, fisheries, energy production, tourism, and environmental protection. It states that only about 40% of the United States Exclusive Economic Zone (U.S. EEZ) has been mapped, and even less has been characterized, including the shoreline and nearshore of Alaska. The memorandum calls for the development of a national strategy for mapping and exploring the U.S. EEZ, as well as a strategy specifically for mapping the shoreline and nearshore of Alaska. It also emphasizes the need for efficient permitting processes for ocean research and exploration activities. The memorandum concludes by stating that it does not impair existing authorities or create any new rights or benefits.
