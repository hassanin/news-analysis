The White House has announced plans to invest over $85 billion in the next decade to modernize the U.S. nuclear weapons complex. This represents a $4.1 billion increase compared to the previous plan. The funding will be used to sustain and modernize the aging nuclear complex and stockpile. The plans include adding nearly $600 million in funding for FY 2012, increasing funding by $4.1 billion over the next five years, and proposing spending over $85 billion for NNSA weapons activities over the next decade. The costs for the Uranium Processing Facility and the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement facility are estimated to be between $3.7 billion to $5.8 billion and $4.2 billion to $6.5 billion, respectively. The Administration is committed to requesting the necessary funds to complete these facilities.
