The hurricanes Harvey and Irma had a significant impact on the US employment figures for September. Nonfarm payrolls fell by 33,000 jobs, even though the unemployment rate decreased to 4.2 percent. The disruption caused by the hurricanes resulted in many workers not receiving a paycheck for that week, even though they were still considered employed in the household survey. The timing of the hurricanes during the data collection period contributed to the unusual number of workers not on the payroll. However, industries involved in rebuilding efforts and those rebounding from losses are expected to see job gains in the future. Despite the job losses reported, the unemployment rate remained low at 4.2 percent, indicating positive growth in the economy.
