President Obama has announced a series of executive actions and private sector commitments to advance clean energy technology innovation, cut energy bills, and create jobs. These actions include making $1 billion in additional loan guarantee authority available for distributed energy projects, unlocking residential Property-Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing for clean energy technologies, launching a program to measure and improve the energy efficiency of homes, creating a DOD Privatized Housing Solar Challenge, approving a transmission line for a 485-megawatt photovoltaic facility, and establishing an Interagency Task Force to promote a clean energy future for all Americans. These actions support the President's goals of reducing emissions, increasing the share of renewables in the electricity generation mix, installing renewable energy in federally subsidized housing, and doubling energy productivity. The President also announced commitments from local governments, utilities, and businesses to drive energy efficiency in low-income households and invest in energy saving activities for veterans and low-income customers. Overall, these actions aim to accelerate America's transition to cleaner sources of energy and ways to cut energy waste.
