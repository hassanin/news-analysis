In a press conference held at the Chief of Mission Residence in Brussels, President Trump expressed his concern about NATO countries not spending enough on defense. He stated that many countries owe the United States a tremendous amount of money for not paying their fair share over the years. The President highlighted Germany's deal with Russia to import oil and gas, which he believes is inappropriate and makes Germany captive to Russia. He argued that NATO allies should not be paying billions of dollars to Russia while expecting protection from Russia. Secretary General Stoltenberg acknowledged the disagreement among NATO allies on the issue of the gas pipeline, but emphasized the importance of unity in dealing with Russia. President Trump expressed confidence that NATO countries will increase their defense spending.
