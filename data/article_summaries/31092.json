Over 100 electric, gas, and water utilities in the United States have reduced customer charges as a result of the Republican tax cuts. The total savings for customers amounts to approximately $3 billion. The cuts in rates or the decision not to pass on the costs of expanding operations have been made by most utilities. The total amount of savings is over $2.8 billion, with additional utility expenses not being passed on to customers. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, was directly cited by several companies as the reason for the rate cuts.
