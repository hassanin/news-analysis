President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the stabilization of Iraq, which was declared in Executive Order 13303 in 2003 and modified in subsequent executive orders, will continue beyond May 22, 2023. The President cites ongoing obstacles to the reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration of peace and security, and the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions in the country as a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, he has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
