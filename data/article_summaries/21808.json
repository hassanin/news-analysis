President Obama released a statement expressing his support for the Senate's cloture vote on the FMAP and Teacher Jobs Funding. He emphasized the importance of ensuring that teachers can continue to teach and that states facing financial difficulties can receive the necessary relief. The President urged the Senate to pass this legislation, which would prevent local budget cuts and save thousands of teacher jobs. He commended Senator Reid for his efforts and anticipated a final vote later in the week.
