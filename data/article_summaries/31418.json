This executive order, issued on June 26, 2020, aims to address the recent assault on the life, property, and rights of American citizens. The order highlights the sustained attacks on civilians, law enforcement officers, government property, and American monuments, such as the Lincoln Memorial. The individuals involved in these acts often identify with ideologies that call for the destruction of the US government. The order condemns anarchists and left-wing extremists who seek to impose their ideology through violence and mob intimidation. It also emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between lawful exercise of rights and vandalism. The order states that the United States will prosecute individuals and entities that destroy, damage, vandalize, or desecrate monuments, memorials, statues, or government property to the fullest extent permitted under federal law. It also highlights the need to prosecute those who incite violence or illegal activity during riots. The order further emphasizes the protection of religious property and states that federal support may be withheld from state and local governments and law enforcement agencies that fail to protect public monuments, memorials, and statues. The Attorney General is directed to prioritize the investigation and prosecution of these matters, and executive departments and agencies are instructed to apply the policies established in the order to their grant programs. Additionally, upon request, personnel from various departments and agencies will assist with the protection of federal monuments, memorials, statues, or property. The order includes general provisions and is implemented subject to applicable law and the availability of appropriations. It also does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or affect the prosecutorial discretion of the Department of Justice.
