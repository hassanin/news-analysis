The US has signed an Executive Order to prevent the Maduro regime in Venezuela from conducting "fire sales" and liquidating critical assets that the country will need to rebuild its economy. The order prohibits the regime from selling or collateralizing certain Venezuelan financial assets and earning money from the sale of certain government entities. The US remains committed to the Venezuelan people and calls for the restoration of democracy, free and fair elections, the release of political prisoners, and an end to repression and economic deprivation. This order is part of a series of actions taken by the US administration targeting the Maduro regime.
