Cabinet Secretaries and senior administration officials are holding events across the country to highlight the administration's commitment to job creation and economic growth. The May unemployment report shows that the economy added 431,000 jobs last month. These events include ribbon cutting ceremonies for Recovery Act-funded projects, tours of local facilities receiving upgrades as a result of Recovery Act investment, and roundtables with small business owners to discuss resources available to them through the federal government to help create jobs. President Obama stated that the economy is moving in the right direction and that the economic policies put in place are working. The report is seen as a sign that the economy is getting stronger.
