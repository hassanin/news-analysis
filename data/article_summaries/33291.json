President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to Cuba, declared in 1996, will continue beyond February 22, 2019. The continuation of this national emergency is based on the belief that a mass migration from Cuba would endanger the security of the United States and disrupt international relations. The unauthorized entry of vessels subject to US jurisdiction into Cuban territorial waters is considered a violation of US law and against US policy. President Trump has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and emergency authority relating to the regulation of vessel anchorage and movement.
