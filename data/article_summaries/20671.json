President Obama has declared a major disaster in Tennessee due to severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding that occurred from February 29 to March 2, 2012. This declaration allows federal funding to be provided to affected individuals in ten counties. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans for uninsured property losses, and other programs to aid in recovery. Federal funding is also available for hazard mitigation measures statewide. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has named Terry L. Quarles as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance by registering online or calling the provided toll-free numbers.
