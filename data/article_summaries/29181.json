President Donald Trump has returned a joint resolution, S.J. Res. 38, without his approval. The resolution aimed to prohibit the issuance of export licenses for the proposed transfer of defense articles, defense services, and technical data to support the manufacture of the Aurora Fuzing System for the Paveway IV Precision Guided Bomb Program in Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom. Trump argues that this resolution would weaken America's global competitiveness, damage important relationships with allies and partners, and conflict with the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States. He states that the licensing prohibition would negatively affect bilateral relationships with Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom and hinder the United States' ability to sustain and shape critical security cooperation activities. Trump also highlights the duty to protect the safety of U.S. citizens residing in Saudi Arabia, the importance of Saudi Arabia as a bulwark against Iran, and the negative impact the resolution would have on NATO Allies and the transatlantic defense industry. Additionally, he argues that the resolution would likely prolong the conflict in Yemen and increase civilian casualties by restricting the production and purchase of precision-guided munitions. Trump encourages Congress to focus on supporting efforts to achieve peace through a negotiated settlement in Yemen.
