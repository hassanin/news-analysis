National Diabetes Month is an opportunity to raise awareness about type 2 diabetes and the importance of preventing it. The number of adults diagnosed with diabetes has doubled in the past two decades, with over 30 million Americans living with the disease. Alarmingly, 1 in 4 Americans with diabetes are unaware they have it. Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in America. Currently, 84 million adults are considered prediabetic. Regular exercise, healthy diets, and an active lifestyle can greatly reduce the chance of developing prediabetes or diabetes. There is currently no cure for diabetes, and medical costs can be high. The administration is committed to ensuring transparency and reducing healthcare costs. Melania Trump also expresses support for those living with diabetes and emphasizes the importance of a healthier lifestyle.
