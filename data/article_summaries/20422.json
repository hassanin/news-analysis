President Barack Obama has proclaimed June 15, 2012, as World Elder Abuse Awareness Day. In his proclamation, he highlights the importance of addressing elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation, which deny older Americans the chance to live in health and security. Elder abuse affects individuals from all walks of life and has detrimental effects on their physical, emotional, and financial well-being. The President emphasizes the need to expose and end elder abuse, and mentions the Elder Justice Act, the Affordable Care Act, and various partnerships and initiatives aimed at protecting seniors. He calls upon all Americans to observe this day by learning about the signs of elder abuse and raising awareness about this public health issue.
