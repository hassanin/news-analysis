President Biden has declared a major disaster in the state of Kansas and authorized federal assistance to support recovery efforts in areas affected by severe storms and straight-line winds on December 15, 2021. Federal funding will be available to state, tribal, and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The designated counties include Barton, Brown, Clay, Cloud, Doniphan, and many others. Hazard mitigation measures statewide will also be eligible for federal funding. DuWayne Tewes has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
