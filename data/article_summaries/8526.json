The Biden-Harris administration has mobilized a whole-of-government response to support the rescue and recovery efforts in Maui following the wildfires.

Companies in Wisconsin have committed over $3 billion in manufacturing and clean energy investments under President Biden's leadership. The Vice President is visiting Seattle to highlight energy-efficient buildings. The President has also announced debt cancellation for student loan borrowers and continues to work on delivering relief to as many borrowers as possible. The President's economic agenda is popular among the American people, and he will continue to focus on delivering for them. The President is actively discussing the possibility of visiting Hawaii but wants to be mindful of the ongoing search and rescue efforts. The President will not comment on ongoing criminal cases and continues to prioritize restoring the independence of the DOJ. The White House expects to avoid a government shutdown and believes that congressional Republicans should work together to meet the urgent needs of the country.
