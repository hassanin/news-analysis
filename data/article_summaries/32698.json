President Donald Trump has issued a memorandum regarding the impact of aluminum imports on national security. The memorandum states that industries such as steel, aluminum, vehicles, aircraft, shipbuilding, and semiconductors are critical to the manufacturing and defense industrial bases of the United States. The memorandum highlights the distortion of both the U.S. and global markets for aluminum products due to large volumes of excess capacity, which result from foreign government subsidies and unfair practices. The low prices caused by excess capacity and unfairly traded imports negatively affect the American aluminum industry by suppressing profits, discouraging long-term investment, hindering research and development efforts, and potentially jeopardizing jobs. The Secretary of Commerce has initiated an investigation to determine the effects of aluminum imports on national security. The Secretary will consider various factors such as domestic production, capacity, resources, and the impact of foreign competition on the economic welfare of domestic industries. The Secretary is required to submit a report with findings and recommendations to the President. The memorandum clarifies that it does not impair existing authorities or create any enforceable rights or benefits.
