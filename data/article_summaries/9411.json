On September 9, 2021, President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced that he is continuing the national emergency declared on September 14, 2001, with respect to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. This declaration is consistent with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act. The terrorist threat is still ongoing, and therefore, the powers and authorities adopted to deal with that emergency must remain in effect beyond September 14, 2021. This notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
