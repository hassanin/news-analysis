President Obama has declared a major disaster in California due to the Rim Fire that occurred from August 17 to October 24, 2013. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. Federal funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. Stephen M. DeBlasio Sr. has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area, and additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
