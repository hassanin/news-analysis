This article is a Presidential Memorandum from November 21, 2012, in which President Barack Obama transmits the National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs. The purpose of this memorandum is to provide direction and guidance to departments and agencies in developing effective insider threat programs. The programs aim to deter, detect, and mitigate actions by employees who may pose a threat to national security. These threats include potential espionage, violent acts against the government or the nation, and unauthorized disclosure of classified information. The Minimum Standards outlined in the memorandum establish the necessary elements for effective insider threat programs, such as the ability to gather and analyze threat-related information, monitor employee use of classified networks, provide insider threat awareness training to the workforce, and protect the civil liberties and privacy of all personnel. The implementation of these programs is expected to strengthen the protection of classified information and enhance defenses against both external adversaries and insiders who misuse their access to endanger national security.
