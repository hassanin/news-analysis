President Biden will announce $82 million in new investments from the American Rescue Plan's Capital Projects Fund to connect 16,000 North Carolina homes and businesses to high-speed internet. This is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's Investing in America agenda, which aims to invest over $3 billion in North Carolina to lower costs for families and connect everyone in the state to affordable and reliable high-speed internet. These investments are creating manufacturing and construction jobs and are made possible through the Affordable Connectivity Program. The Administration has called on Congress to extend funding for this program. President Biden will also discuss progress made towards the goal of connecting every American to high-speed internet by 2030.
