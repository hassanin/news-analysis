The Biden-Harris Administration will embark on a multi-week tour to showcase how President Biden's Investing in America agenda is benefiting communities across the country. The tour will include President Biden, Vice President Harris, First Lady Jill Biden, Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff, Cabinet members, and Senior Administration Officials, who will make numerous stops over the next two weeks. The aim is to demonstrate how Bidenomics is growing the economy from the middle out and bottom up. This tour comes as Republicans in Congress continue to oppose President Biden's agenda and attempt to repeal key legislation that has created jobs and attracted over $500 billion in private sector investments since the start of his Administration. Throughout the tour, the Administration will contrast President Biden's achievements with the Republicans' failed trickle-down policies and their extreme MAGAnomics agenda. The tour will kick off with First Lady Jill Biden visiting Dutchess Community College in Fishkill, New York, where she will attend the launch of a new mechatronics training lab funded in part by President Biden's American Rescue Plan. Additionally, an Advanced Manufacturing Workforce Sprint will be held at the White House to focus on building a diverse and skilled pipeline of workers for good jobs, including union jobs, in advanced manufacturing. Major announcements will be made during the tour regarding infrastructure, private sector investments, and actions taken by the Biden Administration to address climate change, advance environmental justice, and create well-paying jobs in competitive industries. The tour will emphasize that President Biden's investments are inclusive and benefiting communities across America, making them centers of innovation, job creation, and opportunity.
