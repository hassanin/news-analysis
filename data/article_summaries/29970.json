President Donald Trump has declared a major disaster in the state of Wisconsin due to a severe winter storm and flooding that occurred from January 10 to January 12, 2020. This declaration allows for federal assistance to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the affected areas. Federal funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, and hazard mitigation measures. The counties of Kenosha, Milwaukee, and Racine are specifically mentioned as being eligible for this assistance. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has named John Boyle as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments. For more information, media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
