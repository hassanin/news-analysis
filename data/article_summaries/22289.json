First Lady Michelle Obama announced that she will be visiting South Africa and Botswana from June 21 - 26. The visit will focus on youth leadership, education, health, and wellness. Mrs. Obama's trip is part of her ongoing work to engage young people both in the United States and abroad. She will be accompanied by her mother and her daughters. The visit to South Africa and Botswana highlights the importance of the United States' relationship with Africa and its commitment to supporting democracy, development, and economic opportunity across the continent. During her trip, Mrs. Obama will deliver a keynote address at a U.S.-sponsored Young African Women Leaders Forum in South Africa, which aims to empower young women involved in social and economic initiatives in their own countries. The Obama Administration emphasizes the importance of building stronger relationships with Africa's emerging young leaders, investing in the health and well-being of its children, and empowering African women. The United States has deep ties and enduring relationships with Africa, including through family and ancestral connections, religious organizations, non-profit organizations, educational institutions, and businesses. There are also thousands of African students studying in American schools and universities, as well as exchange programs supporting African leadership, economic growth, and cultural ties between the United States and Africa.
