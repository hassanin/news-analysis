The Senate has passed a short-term funding bill to avoid a government shutdown and allow Congress more time to reach an agreement on funding for the rest of the fiscal year. However, funding the government in short increments creates uncertainty and distracts from other important issues. It is now crucial for Democrats and Republicans to work together and find a long-term solution that cuts spending without hindering our ability to succeed in the future. The government is willing to compromise on spending cuts but will oppose harmful reductions in education, innovation, and research funding that are vital for economic growth and job creation. The President is hopeful that Congress can reach a resolution.
