President Trump has authorized an increase in federal funding for debris removal and emergency protective measures in the State of Florida following Hurricane Michael. The President has allowed for a 100 percent federal cost share for a five-day period chosen by the state, followed by a 75 percent federal cost share. This funding is in addition to the 75 percent federal funding already available for public assistance. For more information, media can contact the FEMA news desk.
