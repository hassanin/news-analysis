In this open letter, First Lady Michelle Obama addresses the issue of education disparities for girls worldwide. She highlights the fact that 62 million girls are currently not in school, and in some countries, less than ten percent of girls complete high school. The reasons for this include financial constraints, lack of transportation, and cultural attitudes that prioritize boys' education over girls'. Additionally, girls face risks such as early marriage and threats from terrorist organizations that oppose girls' education. The First Lady urges girls to take their education seriously, despite any challenges they may face, and emphasizes the importance of education for their future. She encourages girls to seek support from teachers or counselors, set goals, and commit to their education. Furthermore, she calls on girls to advocate for girls' education globally by getting involved with organizations, raising awareness, and using social media to educate others. The First Lady believes that every girl deserves the opportunity to receive an education and encourages girls to show determination and courage in pursuing their own education while helping others.
