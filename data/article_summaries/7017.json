Micron, an American company, has announced a $20 billion investment over the next decade and up to $100 billion over twenty years in CHIPS manufacturing in upstate New York. This move is expected to create tens of thousands of well-paying jobs. The investment is seen as a win for America and a testament to the potential of the American people. It aligns with President Biden's economic plan, which aims to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, prioritizing lowering costs for families and promoting domestic production.
