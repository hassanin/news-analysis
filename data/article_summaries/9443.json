President Obama has nominated Jeffrey Alker Meyer and Timothy L. Brooks to serve as district court judges. Meyer is a law professor at Quinnipiac University School of Law and Yale Law School, and has previous experience as a senior counsel and federal prosecutor. Brooks is a partner at a law firm in Arkansas and has focused on civil litigation throughout his career. Both nominees are considered highly qualified and would be valuable additions to the United States District Court.
