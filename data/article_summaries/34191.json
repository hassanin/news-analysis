President Donald J. Trump has declared a major disaster in the State of Tennessee and has ordered federal assistance to support the state's recovery efforts from severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides that occurred between February 19 and March 30, 2019. This declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to state and eligible local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The affected counties include Bedford, Bledsoe, Blount, Campbell, Carter, and many others. Additionally, federal funding will be available for statewide hazard mitigation measures. Manny J. Toro has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas, and further designations may be made if requested by the state and warranted by damage assessments.
