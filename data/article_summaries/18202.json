President Obama held a meeting with leaders from countries that contribute the largest numbers of troops and police to UN peacekeeping operations. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss efforts to strengthen UN peacekeeping in order to effectively meet current challenges. UN peacekeeping missions help protect civilians, create security, and enable emerging democracies to hold elections and strengthen the rule of law. However, the growth and complexity of these missions have put them under severe strain. The Obama Administration is working to ensure that mandates for peacekeeping operations are credible and achievable, intensify efforts to mediate conflicts and revive peace processes, expand the pool and effectiveness of troop and police contributors, help the UN mobilize critical enabling assets, and increase attention to peace-building activities. The United States supports UN peacekeeping by training and equipping troops, providing airlift and logistical assistance, contributing uniformed personnel, working to reach and reinforce cease-fires and peace agreements, and contributing financially. The Presidentâ€™s 2010 budget requests $2.26 billion to meet the U.S. share of peacekeeping assessments. The meeting was a productive discussion about identifying and addressing gaps in UN peacekeeping and pursuing ongoing reform for its future success.
