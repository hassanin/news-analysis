In this article, President Barack Obama transmits legislation and supporting documents to implement the United States Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement. He emphasizes that the agreement will create new opportunities for American workers, farmers, ranchers, businesses, and consumers by opening the Colombian market and eliminating barriers to U.S. goods, services, and investment. The agreement also reflects the commitment of the United States to supporting democracy and economic growth in Colombia. Under the agreement, tariffs on over 80% of U.S. consumer and industrial exports will be eliminated immediately, and U.S. agricultural exports will enjoy substantial new improvements in access to Colombia's market. The agreement also aims to give American service providers greater access to Colombia's services market. It contains provisions to protect and enforce intellectual property rights, reduce regulatory red tape, and eliminate regulatory barriers to U.S. exports. Additionally, the agreement includes high standards for protecting labor rights and carrying out environmental agreements. However, President Obama states that Colombia must successfully implement key elements of the Action Plan Related to Labor Rights before the agreement can be brought into force. He concludes by urging Congress to enact the legislation promptly, as it is vital to ensuring Colombia continues on its trajectory of positive change and is in the national interest of the United States.
