On April 12, 2019, Vice President Pence visited Lincoln's Ridgeview Farms in Pacific Junction, Iowa, to assess the damage caused by flooding in the area. Governor Reynolds and FEMA Acting Director Gaynor were also present. Pence expressed solidarity with the affected families and promised to work with the governor and senators to rebuild Iowa. He praised Governor Reynolds for her swift response and the approval of disaster assistance, which was unfortunately blocked by Democrats in the Senate. Pence called on Congress to put politics aside and provide the support and assistance that Iowa and other affected states need. He also commended the first responders and the charitable community for their efforts in helping the affected families. Pence assured the people of Iowa that they will receive the necessary support and that their communities will be rebuilt stronger than before.
