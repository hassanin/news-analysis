The President of the United States, Joseph R. Biden Jr., has transmitted the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer to the Senate for ratification. The Kigali Amendment, adopted in 2016, aims to gradually reduce the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are alternatives to ozone-depleting substances. The United States already has the necessary domestic authority to implement the obligations of the Kigali Amendment through existing legislation such as the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020 and the Clean Air Act. The amendment has strong support from the U.S. business community and non-governmental organizations. Ratification by the United States would benefit the country by allowing it to remain a leader in the development and deployment of HFC alternatives, providing access to growing refrigeration and cooling markets abroad, and stimulating investment, exports, and job growth in this sector. The Kigali Amendment has already entered into force and currently has 124 Parties. The Senate has previously given its advice and consent to ratification of all four previous amendments to the Montreal Protocol and is recommended to do the same for the Kigali Amendment.
