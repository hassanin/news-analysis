President Trump's policies have led to an economic resurgence in the US, particularly in the manufacturing sector. His promise to cut Obama-era regulations has resulted in $33 billion in savings, with $23 billion saved this year alone. The manufacturing capacity has increased for the 16th straight month, indicating a strengthening economy. US Steel workers are expected to receive their biggest wage increase in at least six years, thanks to Trump's clampdown on foreign imports. The Empire State Index also points to strong manufacturing activity in October. Additionally, job openings in the US have reached a record high of 7.14 million, indicating difficulty in finding qualified workers. Comparing the job growth under the last 21 months of the Obama administration to the first 21 months of Trump's presidency, there have been over 10 times more manufacturing jobs added under Trump. The new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USCMA) is seen as a triumph for free trade across North America. Overall, Trump's policies have been credited with boosting the economy and creating job opportunities for American workers.
