On February 12, 2013, President Obama signed an Executive Order aimed at strengthening the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure. The order focuses on increasing information sharing and developing a framework of cybersecurity practices with industry partners. It expands the Enhanced Cybersecurity Services program, allowing real-time sharing of cyber threat information to assist critical infrastructure companies. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will lead the development of a cybersecurity framework in collaboration with industry stakeholders. The framework will rely on existing international standards and practices. The Executive Order also includes privacy and civil liberties protections, a voluntary program to promote the adoption of the Cybersecurity Framework, and a review of existing cybersecurity regulations. This order builds on previous efforts to protect the nation's digital infrastructure, such as the creation of the National Cybersecurity & Communications Integration Center and the submission of Comprehensive Cybersecurity Legislation to Congress.
