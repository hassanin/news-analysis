In this op-ed, First Lady Michelle Obama discusses the challenges faced by military families stationed overseas and the importance of supporting them. She highlights the sacrifices made by these families, including having to learn new customs and languages, and the added stress of being called to respond to threats or crises at any moment. Despite these challenges, military families serve with courage and grace, often celebrating milestones and holidays with an empty place at the table. The First Lady emphasizes the need for continuous support for these families, not just on special occasions, and encourages Americans to get involved by visiting JoiningForces.gov or reaching out to organizations like the USO and Blue Star Families. She concludes by expressing her commitment to honoring and serving military families even after her time as First Lady ends, and urges others to join her in this effort.
