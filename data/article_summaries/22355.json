The article discusses a presidential memorandum issued by President Barack Obama to establish a comprehensive framework to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and seafood fraud. The United States has been a global leader in sustainable seafood, but IUU fishing continues to undermine the economic and environmental sustainability of fisheries worldwide. The memorandum directs various executive departments and agencies to strengthen coordination and implementation of existing authorities, improve transparency and traceability in the seafood supply chain, and take appropriate actions to assist foreign nations in combating IUU fishing and seafood fraud. A Presidential Task Force on Combating Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing and Seafood Fraud is also established to develop recommendations and strategies to address these issues. The task force will include representatives from various departments and agencies and will coordinate with other initiatives focused on related issues. The memorandum emphasizes the importance of promoting legally and sustainably caught and accurately labeled seafood.
