President Biden has announced the launch of the Building Performance Standards Coalition, a partnership between 33 state and local governments aimed at delivering cleaner, healthier, and more affordable buildings. The coalition will work to design and implement building performance standards, create union jobs, lower energy bills, reduce pollution, and cut emissions from the building sector. This initiative aligns with the Department of Energy's goal to upgrade one million homes and President Biden's plan to retrofit four million buildings and two million homes during his first term. The federal government will provide investments and technical assistance to support climate action and environmental justice efforts at the state and local levels. Building performance standards, developed in collaboration with frontline communities and stakeholders, can address multiple community needs by improving energy efficiency and indoor air quality. They also benefit businesses by attracting higher occupancy rates and generating more revenue. The actions announced today build upon the $3.5 billion investment for home weatherization in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and make $1.8 billion available to state and local governments for building retrofits and policy implementation. The Biden administration will continue to work with Congress to further extend benefits under the Build Back Better Act. The Building Performance Standards Coalition represents over 15 billion square feet of applicable floor space and aims to scale programs and policies that reduce emissions in the buildings sector. The federal government is also providing technical assistance opportunities to coalition members to support the design, measurement, and management of local building performance policies. Overall, these actions demonstrate a commitment to advancing energy efficiency, creating jobs, and addressing climate change at all levels of government.
