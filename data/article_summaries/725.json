The article criticizes the House Freedom Caucus' proposal, arguing that it prioritizes tax breaks for the wealthy and wasteful spending for special interests. It claims that the proposal would negatively impact the middle class, national security, working families, and community safety, while not reducing the deficit. The author suggests that the proposal would result in job losses, increased healthcare premiums, and cuts to Medicare benefits. Additionally, it accuses the proposal of defunding the police, weakening competition with China, and reducing border security funding. The article contrasts this with President's budget, which is said to focus on lowering costs for families, protecting Medicare and Social Security, investing in manufacturing, competing with China, strengthening defense, funding the police, and reinforcing the border. The author argues that the President's budget aligns with the values of Americans, as indicated by numerous polls.
