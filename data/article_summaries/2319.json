President Biden has announced the key outcomes of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), which aims to create a stronger and fairer economy for the United States and the Indo-Pacific region. The IPEF partners, including Australia, Brunei, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, represent 40 percent of the world's GDP. The agreements negotiated between the United States and these partners include provisions to protect labor rights, promote a just transition for workers in clean energy, combat corruption in labor law enforcement, and prevent the exploitation of migrant workers. The IPEF partners are also committed to facilitating trade, advancing workers' rights, strengthening environmental protections, promoting a fair digital economy, and deepening technical assistance and economic cooperation. Additionally, the IPEF partners have established the Agreement on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity and a ministerial-level IPEF Council to support the durability of the framework and its agreements. The IPEF aims to address emerging issues in the future and benefit both American workers and businesses, as well as the people of the region.
