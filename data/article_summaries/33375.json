This article discusses an executive order issued by President Donald Trump on March 5, 2019, regarding veterans and suicide prevention. The order emphasizes the need to improve the quality of life for veterans and reduce the suicide rate among them. It acknowledges that coordination is lacking in the current system, with many veterans who die by suicide not having recently received healthcare services from the Department of Veterans Affairs. The order establishes the Veteran Wellness, Empowerment, and Suicide Prevention Task Force, which includes various government officials. The task force is tasked with developing a comprehensive plan called the President's Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide (PREVENTS). This plan will focus on empowering veterans, coordinating suicide prevention efforts, prioritizing research activities, and strengthening collaboration between the public and private sectors. The task force will also develop a national research strategy to improve coordination, benchmarking, and execution of research related to factors contributing to veteran suicide. Additionally, the order calls for the development of a legislative proposal to establish a program for making grants to local communities to enhance their capacity to collaborate and coordinate resources for veterans. The task force will monitor the implementation of the roadmap and terminate two years after its submission to the President. The order also includes administrative provisions and general provisions.
