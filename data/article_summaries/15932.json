President Obama has designated five new national monuments in Delaware, Maryland, New Mexico, Ohio, and Washington. These monuments celebrate significant people and events in American history, as well as protect natural resources. The designations have received bipartisan support and are expected to promote economic growth through tourism and outdoor recreation. The monuments include the Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers National Monument in Ohio, the First State National Monument in Delaware, the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument in Maryland, the RÃ­o Grande del Norte National Monument in New Mexico, and the San Juan Islands National Monument in Washington. President Obama has previously designated four other monuments using the Antiquities Act. The Antiquities Act has been used by 16 presidents since 1906 to protect unique natural and historic features in America. The designation of these monuments aligns with President Obama's America's Great Outdoors initiative.
