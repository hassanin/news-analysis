On August 3, 2020, President Donald Trump issued an executive order aimed at creating more job opportunities for American workers, particularly during the economic challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The order directs federal agencies to review their contracting and hiring practices, specifically focusing on the use of temporary foreign labor and the offshoring of services previously performed in the United States. The agencies are instructed to assess the impact of these practices on American workers, national security, and the efficiency of federal procurement. They are also required to propose corrective actions if necessary and submit a report summarizing their findings within 120 days. Additionally, within 45 days, the Secretaries of Labor and Homeland Security are tasked with taking measures to protect American workers from adverse effects on wages and working conditions caused by the employment of H-1B visa holders. The executive order concludes with general provisions stating that it does not impede existing authorities or create any new rights or benefits enforceable against the United States.
