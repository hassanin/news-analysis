Vice President Harris is embarking on a month-long "Fight for Our Freedoms College Tour" to mobilize young people in the ongoing fight for fundamental freedoms and rights. She will visit at least seven states and hold large-scale campus events at various schools, including historically Black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, community colleges, apprenticeship programs, and four-year state schools. The tour will focus on issues such as reproductive freedom, gun safety laws, climate action, voting rights, LGBTQ+ equality, and teaching America's full history. The Biden-Harris administration has consistently engaged with and delivered for young people, including investing in education, supporting student borrowers, expanding healthcare access, addressing mental health, making the economy work for workers, standing up for reproductive rights, preventing gender-based violence, addressing gun violence, tackling the climate crisis, advancing civil rights and voting rights, addressing marijuana policy, and advocating for safe and accountable policing.
