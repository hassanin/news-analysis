In his weekly address, President Trump discusses his administration's efforts to remove job-killing regulations and repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare. He claims that Obamacare is collapsing and that the House Bill will replace it with a plan that provides more choices and lower healthcare costs. He also mentions his proposal for a massive tax cut, which he believes will bring jobs and prosperity back to the USA. The tax relief will focus on the middle class and parents raising children. Additionally, he emphasizes the need to reduce the high taxes on American businesses and simplify the tax code. The President concludes by stating that these initiatives, along with fair trade deals, will bring about a new era of prosperity and create opportunities for communities in need.
