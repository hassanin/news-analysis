President Biden addressed the press in the State Dining Room, announcing a new labor agreement between the International Longshoremen and Warehouse Union (ILWU) and the Pacific Maritime Association. The agreement, which has been ratified with overwhelming support from union members, covers 29 ports along the West Coast and includes a guaranteed 32 percent pay increase over six years, as well as a one-time bonus for exceptional efforts during the pandemic. The President emphasized the importance of the ports in the nation's economy, with the Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach alone handling 40 percent of the nation's cargo containers each year. He praised the longshore workers for their dedication during the pandemic, working around the clock to keep the cargo moving and ensure timely deliveries. The President also highlighted the impact of the agreement on reducing inflation, as well as the broader benefits of collective bargaining and strong unions for workers, employers, and the economy. He called on Congress to pass the Protection of the Right to Organize Act (PRO Act) to further support workers' rights to organize unions. President Biden concluded by expressing his confidence in the strength of the American economy and the resilience of the American people.
