The White House has authorized the Department of State to continue providing assistance to Colombia in their efforts to combat drug trafficking. This includes the "Air Bridge Denial (ABD) Program," which aims to intercept civil aircraft suspected of carrying illicit drugs. The President has determined that Colombia has implemented appropriate procedures to minimize the risk of innocent lives being lost during interdiction operations. The United States will work with Colombia to ensure effective counternarcotics operations while adhering to established safety procedures. There have been no reported instances of lethal force being used against innocent civilian aircraft or any fatalities. In the past, drug organizations have used aircraft to transport drugs from Bolivia and Peru to processing labs in Colombia for further distribution to the United States. The US government previously supported aerial interdiction efforts in Colombia and Peru but suspended its support after an accidental shootdown in 2001. However, in 2003, new procedures, oversight measures, and reporting criteria were agreed upon, leading to the initiation of the ABD Program. This program involves US support for Colombia's efforts to intercept aircraft primarily involved in drug trafficking.
