The Obama Administration has announced a partnership with NASCAR, tire manufacturers, and retailers to raise awareness about tire safety and take action to cut carbon pollution and reduce dependence on foreign oil. The Department of Transportation will set a goal to finalize a rule establishing a tire fuel efficiency consumer information program by 2017, to help consumers identify the most energy efficient tires. They will also partner with NASCAR on a Drive for Safety initiative and collaborate with tire manufacturers, fuel distributors, and retailers to kick off a Tire Safety Awareness Month. The administration is encouraging consumers to make smart choices when purchasing and maintaining tires, as it can cut fuel use and save money at the pump. Proper tire maintenance and the use of low rolling resistance tires can save drivers up to $80 per year and avoid up to 560 pounds of annual carbon dioxide pollution. Keeping tires properly inflated and choosing low-rolling resistant tires can have a national impact, potentially saving nearly $500 million dollars and 1.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide pollution per year. The Department of Transportation is also working on tire pressure monitoring systems, supporting the development of efficient tire technology, and highlighting the benefits of efficient tires. They are also working on the next round of fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavy-duty vehicles. The administration has already issued historic standards for passenger vehicles, calling for double fuel economy by 2025 and cutting vehicle greenhouse gas emissions in half.
