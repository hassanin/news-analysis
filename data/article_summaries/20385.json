Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, made statements on the December job situation in a blog post on the White House website. The report shows that there was an increase of 113,000 payroll jobs in December, marking 12 consecutive months of growth that added 1.3 million private sector jobs to the economy in 2010, the highest growth since 2006. The unemployment rate also decreased by 0.4 percentage points to 9.4 percent last month. Goolsbee acknowledges that while the overall trend of economic data in recent months has been encouraging, there is still much to be done. He emphasizes the importance of measures such as extending tax cuts for the middle class and unemployment insurance, as well as focusing on incentivizing businesses to invest and hire domestically, investing in education and infrastructure, and promoting exports. Goolsbee also notes that the private sector employment growth for October and November was revised to reflect an increase, with an average of 128,000 jobs added per month in the fourth quarter, the highest quarterly average in almost four years. The article concludes by stating that while the unemployment rate has decreased significantly, it is still unacceptably high and solid economic growth is needed to recover from the job losses of the past two years. Goolsbee reminds readers that monthly employment and unemployment figures are volatile and subject to considerable revisions, so it is important not to place too much emphasis on a single monthly report.
