President Obama has signed a declaration stating that a major disaster exists in the state of Nebraska. This declaration allows federal aid to be provided to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by severe storms, tornadoes, straight-line winds, and flooding from May 6 to June 17, 2015. The funding will be available on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of damaged facilities, as well as for hazard mitigation measures statewide. Christian M. Van Alstyne has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
