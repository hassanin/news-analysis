President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to the Federal Register stating that the national emergency concerning foreign interference in US elections, declared in Executive Order 13848 on September 12, 2018, will continue beyond September 12, 2021. While there has been no evidence of foreign powers altering election outcomes or vote tabulation, the proliferation of digital devices and internet-based communications has increased the vulnerability and intensity of the threat. The ability of individuals outside the US to interfere in or undermine public confidence in elections poses a significant threat to national security and foreign policy. Therefore, President Biden has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
