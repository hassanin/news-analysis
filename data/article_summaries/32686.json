On June 16, 2006, President Trump declared a national emergency regarding Belarus under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This was due to the actions and policies of certain members of the Belarusian government, who were undermining democratic processes, committing human rights abuses, and engaging in public corruption. The President has now decided to continue this national emergency for another year, as the threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States from these individuals and their actions still persists. This decision is in accordance with the National Emergencies Act. The notice will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
