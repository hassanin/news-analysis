Higher gasoline costs have the potential to harm the ongoing global recovery if not addressed. Despite recent production increases agreed upon by OPEC+, these increases will not fully offset the production cuts imposed during the pandemic until 2022.

OPEC+ is urged to take further action to support the global recovery.
