This article discusses an executive order issued by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to address the growing threat of transnational organized crime (TOC) to public health, public safety, and national security. Transnational criminal organizations engage in various illegal activities such as drug and weapons trafficking, human trafficking, cybercrime, money laundering, and illegal fishing. These organizations contribute to drug overdose deaths in the United States and harm American communities and economic prosperity. They also threaten national security by undermining the rule of law, funding insurgent and terrorist groups, and exploiting vulnerable populations. The executive order establishes a United States Council on Transnational Organized Crime (USCTOC) to coordinate whole-of-government efforts to counter TOC. The USCTOC will develop strategic plans, enhance intelligence sharing, combat illicit finance, and explore new technologies to combat TOC threats. The executive order also directs agencies to provide support and resources to the USCTOC and establishes a USCTOC Strategic Division to develop coordinated strategic plans. The Director of National Intelligence is required to submit an annual report assessing the Intelligence Community's efforts against TOC. The order includes definitions of terms and general provisions.
