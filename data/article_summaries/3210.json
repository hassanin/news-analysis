President Biden and former President Lula of Brazil have launched the Partnership for Worker's Rights, a joint initiative to promote the rights of working people globally. The partnership aims to champion fairness and sustainability in the global economy and ensure that economic growth benefits everyone. It builds on previous collaborations between the United States and Brazil on issues such as racial equality, environmental protection, and democracy. The partnership will involve joint activities and cooperation with labor stakeholders and the International Labour Organization. The Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized labor rights and job creation, and has already made significant investments in these areas. Brazil has also joined the Multilateral Partnership on Worker Organizing, Empowerment, and Rights (M-POWER), and the United States looks forward to working with Brazil and other global partners to create inclusive and sustainable prosperity for workers worldwide.
