The United States expresses support for the women of Iran who are peacefully protesting for their rights and human dignity. The US believes that all people in Iran should have freedom of expression and assembly, and that Iran should stop using violence against its citizens for exercising these freedoms. The US also states that a nation that systematically abuses women's rights should not be part of any international or UN body that protects these rights. Therefore, the US intends to work with its partners to remove Iran from the UN Commission on the Status of Women. The US reassures the protestors that they are seen and heard, and that the officials responsible for the violence will be held accountable.
