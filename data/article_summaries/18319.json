The White House has issued a statement expressing concern over the recent atrocities committed by armed groups in the Central African Republic (CAR) against civilians. The statement highlights the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2127, which grants African Union-led peacekeepers and French forces the authority to protect civilians and restore security in the CAR. The resolution also calls for contingency planning for a potential UN peacekeeping operation. The United States is providing $40 million in assistance to the African Union security mission and is assessing further measures to stabilize the situation and support a political transition. The statement emphasizes the condemnation of violence, the demand for accountability, and the call for all parties to work towards restoring democracy in the CAR.
