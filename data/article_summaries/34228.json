On January 14, 2021, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation to extend a safeguard measure on imports of large residential washers and covered washer parts. The measure was initially imposed on January 23, 2018, and was set to last for 3 years. However, due to increased imports of washers during peak times of the year, the measure's effectiveness was impaired. As a result, the President modified the measure on January 23, 2020, to allocate within-quota quantities on a quarterly basis during the third year. On December 8, 2020, the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) issued a report stating that the safeguard measure is still necessary to prevent serious injury to the domestic industry. Based on this determination, President Trump decided to extend the measure for an additional 2 years. The measure applies to imports from all countries except Canada, and there are certain exemptions for developing countries that are members of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The President also granted authority to the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to modify the measure if necessary. The proclamation includes specific modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) to implement the extended safeguard measure.
