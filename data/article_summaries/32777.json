The passage of the tax bill in the US has led to a decrease in job cuts, with the lowest level of cuts seen since 1990, according to a report by outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas. In December 2017, US employers announced plans to cut 32,423 jobs, bringing the total for the year to 418,770, which is 20% lower than in 2016. Despite these job cuts, the tax bill has also prompted companies to announce unprecedented hiring plans for 2018, with employers reporting plans to hire over 1.1 million new employees, a 27% increase from the previous year. Companies such as AT&T, Fifth Third Bancorp, Wells Fargo, and Boeing have responded to the tax bill by announcing bonuses, wage increases, or new investments.
