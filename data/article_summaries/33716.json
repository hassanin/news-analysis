The Trump Administration has launched FindTreatment.gov, a substance abuse treatment locator tool. This tool allows Americans to find substance use treatment for themselves or others. Users can search for treatment facilities based on the type of treatment offered, payment options, age, languages spoken, and access to medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder. The locator includes over 13,000 state-licensed facilities. The goal is to provide individuals struggling with addiction and their loved ones with the right resources to quickly find help.
