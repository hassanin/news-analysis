On February 29, 2020, President Donald Trump issued an executive order establishing the Interagency Environment Committee for Monitoring and Enforcement. This committee will coordinate efforts to monitor and enforce environmental obligations in accordance with title VIII of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act. The committee will carry out assessments of Mexico and Canada's environmental laws and policies, monitor the implementation and maintenance of their environmental obligations, and request enforcement actions as necessary. The committee will be composed of representatives from various government departments and agencies, with the United States Trade Representative serving as Chair. The committee will make decisions by consensus, but if a consensus cannot be reached, decisions will be made by majority vote. The heads of the executive departments and agencies involved may prescribe regulations to carry out the authorities under the Act. Each department and agency will bear its own expenses related to the committee's functions. The executive order does not affect the authority of any department or agency, nor does it impact the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The order will be implemented in accordance with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. It does not create any enforceable rights or benefits against the United States or any other party.
