President Trump will sign an executive order titled "Strengthening Buy American Preferences for Infrastructure Projects," which aims to fulfill his promise of buying American and hiring American. Currently, billions of taxpayer dollars are being spent on infrastructure projects that do not require Buy American considerations. The executive order aims to close these gaps and ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent on American-made products.
