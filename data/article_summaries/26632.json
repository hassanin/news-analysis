President Trump has announced that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) are reinstating the Midterm Evaluation of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) standards for the automotive industry. The Trump Administration will examine and potentially revise the regulations on auto manufacturers and the costs passed on to consumers. This move is part of President Trump's efforts to bring jobs back to America, as automakers like Ford, General Motors, and Fiat Chrysler have already announced plans to invest in the United States and create thousands of jobs. President Trump has also taken action to reduce excessive regulations that burden businesses, workers, and families, and he is committed to rebuilding America's manufacturing base.
