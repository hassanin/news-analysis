President Obama has launched The President's Fatherhood and Mentoring Initiative, which aims to address father absence in America through partnerships with fatherhood and family-serving groups. The initiative includes community forums on fatherhood and personal responsibility, e-newsletters featuring articles and resources, and cultural impact efforts by organizations supporting the initiative. The President has also proposed a Fatherhood, Marriage, and Families Innovation Fund to scale up effective programs and provided funding for transitional jobs programs for noncustodial parents. Over the past year, Administration officials have held events across the country to discuss the challenges faced by fathers and their families.
