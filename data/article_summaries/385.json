The Biden-Harris Administration is hosting a Families of Overdose Event at the White House today in recognition of International Overdose Awareness Day. President Biden has declared August 27 through September 2 as Overdose Awareness Week to draw attention to the devastating impact of illicit fentanyl and other drugs. The administration is announcing over $450 million to strengthen prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and recovery support services, as well as crack down on illicit drug trafficking. The event at the White House will provide an opportunity for family members who have lost loved ones to share their stories and discuss ways to end the overdose epidemic. The administration is focused on saving lives and has seen progress in reducing overdose deaths, with 13 consecutive months of leveling off according to the latest CDC report. The efforts of the administration include strengthening prevention, supporting state and local treatment and recovery efforts, and disrupting illicit drug trafficking operations.
