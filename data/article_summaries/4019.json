Today marks the fourth year of American Paul Whelan's wrongful detention in Russia. The President and the speaker have assured the Whelan family that they will continue their efforts until Paul is released and all Americans can celebrate his return. The Whelan family has shown generosity of spirit by celebrating the return of another American, while Russia continues to use Paul as a bargaining chip. The speaker is grateful for the partnership of the Whelan family and is thinking of them and Paul on this day.
