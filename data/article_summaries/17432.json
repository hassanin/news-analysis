President Obama and Prime Minister Cameron of the UK had a phone call to discuss the shared security challenges faced by their countries, particularly the ongoing violence in Syria. They expressed concern about the reported use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime against civilians near Damascus. The two leaders will continue to consult closely on this issue and possible responses by the international community. Both the United States and the UK are opposed to the use of chemical weapons.
