The United States has expressed its welcome for the ceasefire between Israel and Gaza-based militants, which was brokered by the Egyptian Government. The ceasefire comes after nearly five days of fighting and is aimed at preventing further loss of life and restoring calm for both Israelis and Palestinians. U.S. officials have worked closely with regional partners to achieve this resolution and have expressed gratitude for the diplomatic efforts of President Abdel Fattah El Sisi and senior Egyptian officials, as well as Amir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar.
