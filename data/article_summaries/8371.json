The theme for the 2021 White House Holiday Season is "Gifts from the Heart," according to First Lady Jill Biden. The theme is inspired by the things that unite us, such as faith, family, friendship, and gratitude. The First Lady and President wrote a welcome letter expressing their wishes for a happy and joyous holiday season. The First Lady will offer a holiday message of unity and gratitude and will thank the volunteers who helped decorate the White House. The decorations in each room of the White House reflect the theme, with each room representing a different gift, such as the Gift of Service, Gift of Learning, Gift of Friendship and Sharing, Gift of Faith and Community, Gift of Gratitude, Gift of Nature, Gift of Peace and Unity, and Gift of the Performing Arts. The State Dining Room features a gingerbread replica of community buildings representing frontline workers. Videos, photos, and information about the decorations will be available on WhiteHouse.gov/Holidays, and there will be interactive viewing experiences on digital platforms. Additionally, characters from PBS KIDS will help bring the holiday spirit to children across the nation through free educational resources.
