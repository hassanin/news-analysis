President Obama convened a National Security Council meeting to discuss the progress of the global campaign to degrade and destroy ISIL. The President was briefed on the advances made against ISIL in both Iraq and Syria, with the Iraqis reclaiming over 50% of the territory once controlled by ISIL and partners in northern Syria closing off ISIL's access to the Syrian border with Turkey. The President instructed his team to continue close coordination with partners and plan operations to further pressure ISIL. However, the President expressed concern about the Syrian regime blocking humanitarian aid despite decreased violence in the country. He stated that the United States will not proceed with the next steps in the arrangement with Russia until there are seven continuous days of reduced violence and sustained humanitarian access.
