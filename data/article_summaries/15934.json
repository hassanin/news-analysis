This memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama, addresses the distribution of Department of Defense funded humanitarian assistance in Syria. The President determines that a specific section of the United States Code would hinder the distribution of urgently needed humanitarian aid in Syria. Therefore, he waives the prohibition outlined in the code section for humanitarian reasons, allowing the Department of Defense to carry out the distribution of assistance in Syria. The Secretary of Defense is directed to publish this determination in the Federal Register.
