This article discusses the continuation of the national emergency declared by the President of the United States with respect to the actions of the Government of Syria. The national emergency was initially declared in 2004 and has been modified and expanded over the years. The President took these actions due to the threat posed by Syria's support for terrorism, occupation of Lebanon, pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, and undermining of stabilization efforts in Iraq. The article highlights the brutality and repression of the Syrian regime against its own people and emphasizes the need for a political settlement and humanitarian assistance in Syria. The United States condemns the violence and human rights abuses committed by the Assad regime and its Russian and Iranian supporters. Changes in Syria's policies and actions will be considered in determining whether to continue or terminate the national emergency in the future.
