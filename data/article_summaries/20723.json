The White House held a press briefing on June 24, 2009, where Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman, and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan discussed the simplification of the federal financial aid application. They announced that the current application process is lengthy and burdensome, and that they are working to make it easier for students and their families to apply for financial aid. The goal is to increase college enrollment among low-income and middle-income students. They also discussed other initiatives to make college more affordable and accessible, such as changes to the direct loan program, tuition tax credits, and funding for states to improve college completion rates for low-income students. The press briefing also touched on other topics, such as the upcoming visit of President Obama to meet with Pope Benedict XVI, the situation in Iran, and the President's stance on healthcare reform.
