President Biden held a bilateral meeting with Mexican President López Obrador as part of the North American Leaders' Summit. The meeting focused on a range of issues, including migration, fentanyl, supply chains, clean energy cooperation, and economic vision for North America. The two leaders also discussed broader law enforcement cooperation, combating the climate crisis, and people-to-people ties. The meeting provided an opportunity for President Biden to deepen his personal engagement with President López Obrador. The leaders also had a personal dinner together. There was no fixed number discussed for the acceptance of migrants from the U.S., and the parole program for Venezuelans, Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Haitians will be evaluated before determining the next step. The energy policy consultations between the two countries were also discussed, with the U.S. considering potential next steps but not revealing them publicly. President Biden is expected to speak with former Brazilian President Lula da Silva in the future but no call has been scheduled yet. The U.S. expressed confidence in the resilience of Brazilian democracy and condemned the assault on democratic institutions. The U.S. and Canada are discussing ways to support stability in Haiti, including the provision of multinational security support to the Haitian National Police. The U.S. does not foresee a major military operation in Haiti but rather aims to find a sustainable solution. The U.S. remains committed to supporting Ukraine and has requested a budget of $45 billion to do so. The U.S. believes that the majority of Americans support providing assistance to Ukraine. The JCPOA was discussed, with Israel's new leader expressing opposition to the agreement, but the U.S. emphasized its commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon through diplomacy and international pressure. The U.S. condemned the execution of Iranian protesters by the Iranian government. Efforts are being made to disrupt Iran's military cooperation with Russia, particularly in relation to the sale of drones. The U.S. hopes for enhanced cooperation with Mexico on fentanyl and expects commitments for stronger cooperation in this area. President Biden has not read the letter from Governor Abbott and there is no response to share at this time.
