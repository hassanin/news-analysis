In January, a U.S. counterterrorism operation accidentally killed two innocent hostages held by al-Qa'ida. The hostages were Dr. Warren Weinstein, an American held since 2011, and Giovanni Lo Porto, an Italian national held since 2012. The operation targeted an al-Qa'ida compound where there was no reason to believe the hostages were present. The Intelligence Community has determined with high confidence that both hostages were accidentally killed. Two other Americans, Ahmed Farouq and Adam Gadahn, were also killed in separate counterterrorism operations in the same region. Although they were al-Qa'ida members, they were not specifically targeted. President Obama takes full responsibility for these operations and has ordered a thorough independent review to prevent similar incidents in the future. The information about these operations has been declassified and shared with the American people.
