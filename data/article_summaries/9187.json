President Biden and Vice President Harris are heading to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to highlight the progress made in improving water infrastructure and replacing lead pipes. The administration is working towards replacing all lead service lines in the next decade, with funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, American Rescue Plan, and annual appropriations. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes nearly $50 billion for clean water, with $15 billion set aside at the EPA for loans and grants to remove lead service lines. The investments in water improvements will also create new well-paying jobs. Since taking office, the administration has funded the removal of over 100,000 lead service lines, with $1.2 billion approved for 23 states for lead service line identification and replacement. Last week, Vice President Harris hosted a summit on lead pipe replacement and announced new actions and progress in delivering clean drinking water and remediating lead paint. The administration has also allocated $8.1 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding to Pennsylvania for various infrastructure projects. Additionally, under President Biden, the administration is focused on building an economy from the bottom up, including creating good-paying jobs, promoting small business growth, and encouraging manufacturing investments in Pennsylvania.
