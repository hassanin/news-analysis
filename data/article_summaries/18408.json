President Obama delivered a commencement address at Arizona State University in 2009. After his address, ASU announced the expansion of its financial aid program, renaming it the President Barack Obama Scholars Program. The program provides funding for direct costs to academically qualified Arizona freshmen from families that earn less than $60,000. The program also includes a work-study campus job requirement. The number of scholars increased from 500 to over 1,600 freshmen entering ASU in fall 2009. The article also provides background information on six recipients of the Obama Scholars Program who were present at the commencement ceremony.
