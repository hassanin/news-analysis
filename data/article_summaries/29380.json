The Trump Administration has released a new tool called the Rural Community Action Guide to help rural community leaders in tackling the addiction crisis. The guide provides background information, recommended action steps, and promising practices for addressing drug addiction in rural America. It aims to empower local leaders to develop effective responses to addiction and create real change in their communities. The guide is part of the administration's whole-of-government approach, which includes partnering with those on the front lines of the fight against addiction. It complements other resources such as the Community Assessment Tool and the Federal Rural Resources Guide. The guide is based on lessons learned from roundtable discussions in various states and input from rural stakeholders.
