President Biden has announced his intention to appoint Dr. Tony Allen as the Chair of the President's Board of Advisors on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).

Under his leadership, the university has achieved significant accomplishments, including being ranked as the #3 public HBCU in America, receiving an R2 "high research activity" designation, and acquiring Wesley College. Dr. Allen has also played a prominent role in fundraising and media appearances, drawing national attention to Delaware State University. He holds a Ph.D. in Public Policy from the University of Delaware and serves on various boards and advisory councils.
