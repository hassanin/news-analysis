President Biden has signed an Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy, aiming to create a fairer and more dynamic economy. One area of concern is the meat and poultry processing sector, where a few large companies dominate the market, leading to higher prices for consumers and less opportunity for small businesses. The top four meat-packing companies control a significant portion of the market, limiting options for farmers and squeezing their profits. The Biden-Harris Administration has developed an Action Plan to address these issues, including dedicating $1 billion in funds to expand independent processing capacity. The plan also aims to strengthen rules that protect farmers and consumers, promote competition, and increase transparency in cattle markets.
