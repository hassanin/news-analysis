President Obama has declared a major disaster in the State of Rhode Island due to a severe winter storm and snowstorm that occurred in February 2013. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts. The federal funding will be available for emergency work, repair or replacement of damaged facilities, snow assistance, and hazard mitigation measures. James N. Russo has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Additional designations may be made in the future based on further damage assessments.
