The Battle of the Coral Sea, which took place 75 years ago, was a significant moment in World War II. The United States and Australia successfully halted a major Japanese advance, weakening the Japanese fleet and ultimately contributing to their defeat in the Pacific. However, this victory came at a great cost, with the allied forces losing hundreds of men, aircraft, and ships. President Donald Trump attended a commemorative event and shared the story of Lieutenant Jack Powers, an American Navy flyer who gave his life in battle. Powers played a crucial role in sinking an enemy carrier and urged his fellow pilots to take risks to win the battle. He ultimately sacrificed his life in a devastating blow on another carrier. President Trump emphasized the courage and sacrifice of Powers and all the brave souls who fought in the Battle of the Coral Sea, expressing hope that their deeds would be remembered and honored.
