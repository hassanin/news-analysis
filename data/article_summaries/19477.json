President Barack Obama has proclaimed April 16th to April 24th, 2011 as National Park Week in the United States. National parks, whether small historic sites or large natural spaces, contribute to the nation's health and spirit by preserving history, protecting ecosystems, providing natural resources, and offering opportunities for outdoor recreation. The theme for this year's National Park Week is "Healthy Parks, Healthy People," emphasizing the connection between human and environmental well-being. To encourage citizens to visit national parks, all entrance fees will be waived during this week. The proclamation also highlights the America's Great Outdoors Initiative, which aims to create a conservation ethic and reconnect Americans with their natural and cultural heritage. The National Park Service works with various stakeholders to promote physical activity in parks, generate economic benefits, and support local park development. The proclamation calls on all Americans to conserve lands and appreciate the beauty of national parks.
