The President has sent a letter to the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate stating that the national emergency with respect to transnational criminal organizations will continue beyond its anniversary date. The President believes that these organizations pose a threat to international political and economic systems, as they are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dangerous. They are involved in the operations of foreign governments and the international financial system, weakening democratic institutions, the rule of law, and economic markets. These organizations also facilitate violent conflicts and the activities of other dangerous individuals. Therefore, the President has determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
