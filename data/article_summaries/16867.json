The White House announced a two-year freeze in civilian federal worker pay. This decision is part of the effort to address the massive deficit and unsustainable fiscal course the country is on. The freeze will save $2 billion for the fiscal year 2011 and $28 billion when combined with the savings from the second year's freeze in 2012. The announcement affects only civilian workers and does not affect military personnel. The President is asking federal employees to make a sacrifice as part of the efforts to reduce costs and make government more efficient. The decision does not require congressional approval. The timing of the announcement was driven by a legal requirement for the President to submit locality pay for 2011, and the need to decide on 2012 compensation as part of the budget process. The decision is not a response to recent coverage of federal worker pay. The savings from the freeze will be $2 billion for fiscal year 2011 and $28 billion over the next five years. The freeze does not prevent employees from receiving promotions.
