President Obama has declared a state of emergency in North Dakota due to flooding. This declaration allows for federal aid to supplement the state and local response efforts. The Department of Homeland Security, specifically the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), will coordinate disaster relief efforts to alleviate the hardship and suffering caused by the flooding. The assistance will include flood fighting preparations and measures to protect lives, property, and public health and safety. FEMA is authorized to provide equipment and resources as needed. The federal funding for emergency protective measures, including direct assistance, will be at 75%. Justo Hernandez has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. For more information, contact FEMA.
