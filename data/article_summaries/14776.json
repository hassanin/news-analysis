The United States is providing an additional $5 million in assistance to Georgia, pending consultations with the U.S. Congress. This assistance aims to help individuals affected by Russia's "borderization" of Georgia's occupied territories, increase access to independent information, promote national unity, and strengthen justice sector institutions. The $5 million assistance package includes small infrastructure projects, vocational training, access to finance, microenterprise assistance, increased access to objective information, and support for the Ministry of Justice's establishment of an inspectorate responsible for monitoring compliance with Georgia's new anti-discrimination law. This assistance complements long-term U.S. assistance programs that focus on strengthening the rule of law, promoting democracy and good governance, boosting economic growth, and assisting in resolving conflicts that respect Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. In total, the United States is providing approximately $65 million in assistance to Georgia this year.
