The American Broadband Initiative (ABI) report has been announced, reflecting a multi-agency effort to remove barriers to broadband deployment in the US. The initiative, led by the White House, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Commerce, aims to provide reliable high-speed broadband access to all Americans. Currently, nearly 39 percent of Americans in rural areas lack sufficient broadband access. The report acknowledges that there is still much work to be done, but sees this as a significant step towards achieving modern broadband infrastructure for all Americans.
