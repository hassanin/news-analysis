President Obama plans to take further steps to ensure that every American has access to fast and affordable broadband. He will be announcing these steps in Cedar Falls, Iowa, where communities have already taken measures to bring in new competition and provide high-speed, low-cost broadband. The Obama administration is calling to end laws in 19 states that hinder broadband service competition, and is urging the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to address barriers that prevent local communities from meeting the broadband needs of their citizens. The administration is also expanding the National Movement of Local Leaders for Better Broadband, with 50 cities and 37 research universities already joining the coalition. The Department of Commerce is launching a new initiative called BroadbandUSA to promote broadband deployment and adoption, and the Department of Agriculture is accepting applications for its Community Connect broadband grant program and reopening a revamped broadband loan program. President Obama is calling for the removal of unnecessary regulatory and policy barriers to broadband build-out and competition, and is establishing a new Broadband Opportunity Council to speed up broadband deployment and promote adoption. The report also highlights success stories from cities like Chattanooga, TN, Kansas City, MO, and Lafayette, LA, which have broadband speeds nearly 100 times faster than the national average. These cities have achieved this through new competition, partnerships, and municipal investments. The report concludes that more competition in the broadband market leads to lower prices, better products, and better customer service.
