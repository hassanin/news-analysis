President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed November 18, 2021, as National Rural Health Day, emphasizing the importance of supporting the health and well-being of rural communities in the United States. Rural Americans face unique challenges in accessing healthcare, including limited access to providers, lack of broadband for telehealth services, and healthcare infrastructure deficiencies. In response to these challenges, President Biden's American Rescue Plan (ARP) has allocated $8.5 billion to rural health providers, in addition to previous funding for COVID-19 testing, mitigation, and vaccine outreach efforts. The plan also includes $500 million for the Emergency Rural Health Care Grant Program, aimed at assisting rural communities with testing, treatment, medical supplies, food assistance, and facility renovations. Furthermore, the administration's Build Back Better framework aims to deliver affordable, high-quality healthcare to rural Americans, lower healthcare costs, keep rural hospitals open, and address underlying causes of poor health, such as outdated water infrastructure. The administration is also coordinating efforts across federal, state, tribal, territorial, and local governments to promote health equity, support rural hospitals and clinics, expand telehealth, improve community health, and increase access to capital for affordable healthcare. The proclamation concludes by urging the American people to reaffirm their dedication to the health and well-being of rural America.
