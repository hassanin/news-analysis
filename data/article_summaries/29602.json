President Donald J. Trump has declared a state of emergency in California and ordered Federal assistance to aid in response efforts to the ongoing wildfire. The declaration authorizes the Department of Homeland Security, specifically the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate disaster relief efforts aimed at alleviating the suffering and hardship caused by the emergency. FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide necessary equipment and resources to mitigate the impacts of the wildfire. Emergency protective measures, limited to direct Federal assistance, will be funded at 75 percent by the Federal government. William Roche has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected areas. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
