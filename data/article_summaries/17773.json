In this article, President Barack Obama announces the continuation of the national emergency with respect to the Russian Federation. He explains that Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act requires the President to publish a notice in the Federal Register and transmit it to Congress prior to the anniversary date of the emergency to extend its duration. The emergency was initially declared in Executive Order 13159 on June 21, 2000, due to the risk of nuclear proliferation caused by the accumulation of weapons-usable fissile material in Russia. The President states that it is a major national security goal of the United States to ensure that this material is dedicated to peaceful uses, subject to transparency measures, and protected from diversion to activities of proliferation concern. Therefore, he determines that it is necessary to continue the national emergency and maintain the emergency authorities to address this threat.
