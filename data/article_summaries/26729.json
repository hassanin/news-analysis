President Donald Trump issued a proclamation declaring March 4 through March 10, 2018, as National Consumer Protection Week. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of safeguarding and strengthening the economy through consumer education and fraud prevention. It highlights various scams and schemes that consumers should be aware of, including identity theft, cybersecurity breaches, and charity fraud. The proclamation also mentions the Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act, which increases penalties for criminals who target older Americans. Imposter fraud is identified as one of the fastest-growing scams, with fraudsters posing as various entities to gain the trust of unsuspecting consumers. The proclamation encourages individuals to learn about their consumer rights, make informed financial decisions, and protect themselves from fraud and abuse. It also encourages the utilization of online resources provided by the Federal Trade Commission and the sharing of information through consumer education activities.
