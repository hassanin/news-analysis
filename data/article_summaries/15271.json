President Obama has announced a goal of recruiting 10,000 Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) teachers over the next two years. This is part of the administration's larger goal of preparing 100,000 STEM teachers over the next decade. The president believes that strengthening STEM education is crucial for preparing students to compete in the 21st-century economy. He has identified three priorities for STEM education: increasing STEM literacy, improving the quality of math and science teaching, and expanding opportunities for underrepresented groups, including women and minorities.
