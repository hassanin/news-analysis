On November 14, 1979, the President declared a national emergency with respect to Iran due to the threat it posed to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. This emergency has not yet been resolved, and the process of implementing agreements with Iran is still ongoing. Therefore, the national emergency declared in 1979 will continue beyond November 14, 2022, for another year. This renewal is separate from previous renewals and is distinct from another emergency declared in 1995. The notice of this renewal will be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to Congress.
