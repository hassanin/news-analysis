President Biden has signed a Presidential Memorandum prioritizing the restoration of wild salmon, steelhead, and other native fish populations in the Columbia River Basin. This memorandum is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's commitment to honoring obligations to Tribal Nations and protecting America's natural wonders. The Columbia River and its tributaries are vital to the Pacific Northwest, supporting various aspects of life, including culture, commerce, and recreation. However, actions such as dam construction and overfishing have severely depleted fish populations in the region, affecting the rights of Tribal Nations to hunt and fish. The memorandum directs federal agencies to use existing authorities and resources to restore fish populations and uphold treaty responsibilities to the Tribes. It also encourages collaboration between federal, tribal, and state entities. The memorandum builds on a historic agreement with Tribal Nations to reintroduce salmon into blocked habitats in the Upper Columbia River Basin. The administration has allocated significant resources to support conservation efforts, including funds for fish passage, ecosystem restoration, and the construction of Tribally led fish hatcheries. The ultimate goal is to restore wild fish populations while promoting clean energy, supporting the agriculture economy, and addressing the region's resilience needs.
