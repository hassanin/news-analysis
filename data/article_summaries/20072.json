President Barack Obama has proclaimed September as National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. The proclamation aims to raise awareness of the disease and support those affected by it. Ovarian cancer often goes undetected until advanced stages, so increasing awareness of risk factors is crucial. The President encourages all women, especially those at higher risk, to talk to their doctors. The administration is also investing in research to improve understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of ovarian cancer. The Affordable Care Act provides increased access to healthcare options and protections for women with ovarian cancer. By 2014, the law will ban insurers from setting restrictive annual caps on benefits and charging higher rates based on gender. The proclamation calls on citizens, government agencies, organizations, healthcare providers, and research institutions to raise awareness and support efforts to combat ovarian cancer.
