President Barack Obama has proclaimed September 2014 as National Preparedness Month. He emphasizes the importance of being prepared for emergencies and encourages Americans to take simple but important steps to ensure they know what to do and have what they need in the event of a crisis. This includes being familiar with local threats and hazards, assembling a disaster supplies kit, and having a plan to reconnect with family after a tragedy. The President also highlights the need for communities to be resilient and prepared for natural disasters, such as wildfires and flooding, in a changing climate. He acknowledges the efforts of emergency responders and urges Americans to work together to enhance national security, resilience, and readiness.
