The article discusses the global threat of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, and the emergence of new variants. The United States Government identifies certain variants as variants of concern, including the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant. Vaccination is highlighted as the best way to prevent the spread of COVID-19, with vaccinated individuals being less likely to be infected or experience severe illness. Efforts are being made to increase vaccination rates worldwide, including the donation of vaccine doses by the United States. In light of these efforts, President Biden has determined that the United States should adopt an air travel policy that primarily relies on vaccination to safely resume international travel. The proclamation suspends the entry of non-vaccinated noncitizen nonimmigrants into the United States, with exceptions and requirements for testing, mask-wearing, and vaccination. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, along with other relevant departments, will implement and enforce the proclamation. The proclamation will remain in effect until terminated by the President.
