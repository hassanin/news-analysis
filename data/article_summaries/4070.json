The article discusses the importance of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) as a critical intelligence tool used to protect the United States and its citizens. It highlights the various successes achieved through intelligence obtained under this authority, such as countering threats from China, addressing Russian atrocities in Ukraine, combating terrorism, disrupting fentanyl trafficking, and mitigating the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack. With Section 702 set to expire in 2023, the President has requested a review of its effectiveness and potential reforms. The Biden-Harris administration has released the majority of the report from the President's Intelligence Advisory Board (PIAB) in an unclassified format. They support the board's unanimous conclusion that failure to reauthorize Section 702 could lead to a significant intelligence failure. The administration also agrees with the board's recommendation to reauthorize Section 702 without imposing new restrictions that could hinder the review of lawfully collected intelligence. They intend to work with Congress to secure the reauthorization of this important national security authority.
