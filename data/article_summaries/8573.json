President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has proclaimed May 20, 2022, as National Defense Transportation Day and May 15 through May 21, 2022, as National Transportation Week. This is to recognize the importance of the nation's transportation infrastructure and honor the professionals who design, build, operate, and maintain it. The proclamation highlights the historical significance of transportation infrastructure, including the creation of the Interstate Highway System by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. It also acknowledges the challenges faced by the transportation system, such as accessibility issues, pollution, climate change, and infrastructure disrepair. President Biden emphasizes the importance of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which provides significant investment in repairing and modernizing the nation's infrastructure, including roads, bridges, passenger rail, and public transit. The goal is to create safer roads, better public transit options, and a national network of electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The proclamation concludes by urging all Americans to observe these occasions with appropriate ceremonies, programs, and activities to show appreciation for those who contribute to the transportation systems of the United States.
