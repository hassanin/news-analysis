President Obama announced a comprehensive plan for regulatory reform to modernize and protect the integrity of the financial system. The plan includes requirements for strong supervision and regulation of financial firms that pose significant risks, increasing market discipline and transparency, creating a Consumer Financial Protection Agency, providing the government with tools to manage financial crises, and raising international regulatory standards. The President was joined by Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, representatives from the regulatory community, consumer groups, the financial industry, and members of Congress for the announcement.
