The United States has released a new National Strategy for the Arctic Region, with a focus on addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by climate change in the region. The strategy aims to create a peaceful, stable, prosperous, and cooperative Arctic region, while also accounting for increasing strategic competition, particularly from Russia and China. The strategy will be guided by four pillars, covering both domestic and international issues, and will be guided by five principles. The goal is to guide the U.S. government's approach to the Arctic over the next ten years.
