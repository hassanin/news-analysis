The Kerem Shalom border crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip has been a site of conflict for many years. Recently, Israeli authorities foiled an attempt to smuggle explosives into Gaza, suspected to be intended for long-range projectiles to be fired into Israel. The crisis in Gaza is largely the responsibility of Hamas, the fundamentalist terror group that has controlled the area since 2007. While Hamas' attacks on Israel are well-known, its exploitation of the people of Gaza is equally appalling. The Gaza Strip is facing economic disorder, with Hamas squandering resources on its campaign against Israel instead of improving the lives of the people it claims to govern. Hamas receives large sums of money, including $100 million annually from Iran, which it uses for weapons and tunnels instead of helping the people of Gaza. Iran is complicit in this crisis, as its financing has not improved living conditions or grown the economy. President Trump has emphasized the need to continue exerting pressure on Tehran. Only when terrorism is replaced with respect for human life and dignity can Gaza begin to rebuild and grow its economy.
