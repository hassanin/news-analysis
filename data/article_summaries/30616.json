President Donald Trump has signed into law the Sam Farr and Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act of 2018. One provision of the Act, section 203, states that the Director of the Peace Corps must notify and consult with the appropriate congressional committees at least 15 days in advance before opening, closing, reducing, or suspending a Peace Corps office or country program. The President acknowledges the benefits of working with Congress on these decisions but believes that the requirement to consult with Congress violates the separation of powers. The Administration will make efforts to notify the committees as required by the Act but will treat the consultation requirement as advisory and non-binding.
