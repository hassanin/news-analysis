The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has announced $4.5 million in grants to help local programs combat the opioid crisis. The grants, known as "Combating Opioid Overdose through Community-Level Intervention (COOCLI)" grants, were awarded to 14 programs across the United States. The projects, overseen by the University of Baltimore, will focus on various approaches such as identifying high-risk individuals, supporting medication-assisted treatment in jails, collaborating with public safety agencies, and connecting pregnant and postpartum women to opioid use disorder care coordination services. The grants aim to encourage innovative ideas and collaboration between law enforcement and public health agencies to address the opioid crisis at the community level.
