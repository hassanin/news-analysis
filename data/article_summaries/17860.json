President Obama was briefed by DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano and FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate on the response to the severe winter storm moving across the country. The storm has caused power and transportation disruptions in the Midwest and potential severe weather in the Northeast. FEMA personnel have been deployed to several states and commodities such as water, meals, blankets, and generators are being positioned for rapid delivery if needed. The President emphasized the need for close coordination between all levels of government and encouraged Americans to follow the instructions of state and local officials for emergency information. He also thanked the first responders, federal employees, and volunteer agencies working to respond to the storm.
