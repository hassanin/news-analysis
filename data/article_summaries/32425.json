First Lady Melania Trump announced the launch of an awareness campaign called BE BEST, aimed at addressing issues affecting children today. The campaign focuses on three main pillars: wellbeing, social media use, and opioid abuse. Melania emphasized the importance of educating children about these issues and providing them with the support and tools they need to grow up to be happy and productive adults. She highlighted examples of individuals and programs that have made positive impacts in these areas, such as Christian Bucks and his "Buddy Bench" initiative, as well as the Viking Huddle class at Orchard Lake Middle School. Melania also expressed the need to teach children about responsible online behavior and the consequences of their words, and she emphasized the importance of addressing the opioid epidemic and supporting recovery programs. She called on everyone to join her in providing support and guidance to children and working together to make a difference.
