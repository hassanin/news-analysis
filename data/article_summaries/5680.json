President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13660, which was expanded in subsequent executive orders, is to continue in effect beyond March 6, 2022. The national emergency pertains to the actions and policies of individuals undermining democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine, as well as the actions and policies of the Russian government, including its annexation of Crimea and use of force in Ukraine. President Biden believes that these actions continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
