President Obama spoke with President Putin of Russia regarding the situation in Crimea. He emphasized that the Crimean "referendum" would not be recognized by the United States and the international community as it violates the Ukrainian constitution and occurred under duress of Russian military intervention. President Obama stated that Russia's actions are in violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and that additional costs could be imposed on Russia in coordination with European partners. He highlighted the need for a diplomatic resolution that addresses the interests of both Russia and Ukraine, and urged Russia to support the deployment of international monitors to prevent violence. President Obama also mentioned that a diplomatic solution cannot be achieved while Russian military forces continue their incursions into Ukrainian territory, and expressed Secretary Kerry's readiness to work with Foreign Minister Lavrov and the Ukrainian government to find a resolution to the crisis.
