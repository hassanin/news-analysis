President Biden and Vice President Harris are committed to ensuring that every person has access to clean air, clean water, and a healthy community. To achieve this, President Biden has launched an ambitious environmental justice agenda, which includes signing an executive order to embed environmental justice into the work of federal agencies. The order aims to address environmental injustices faced by communities, such as toxic pollution, underinvestment in infrastructure, and disproportionate harms due to racial discrimination. The goal is to provide cleaner air and water, reduce health burdens, and improve access to green space, safe housing, and clean transportation for all people, regardless of their race, background, income, ability, Tribal affiliation, or zip code. The executive order reflects the recommendations of the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council and emphasizes the need for transparency and accountability in government actions. The order builds upon previous efforts to address environmental injustices and is part of the Biden-Harris Administration's whole-of-government approach to confront these issues. The administration is also announcing additional steps to further their commitment to environmental justice. This is part of President Biden's broader agenda to create clean energy jobs, lower costs, meet climate goals, and strengthen communities that have been historically marginalized. The administration has made significant progress in advancing environmental justice over the past two years. For more information, visit the White House website.
