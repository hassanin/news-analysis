The U.S. has implemented a comprehensive response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, including providing financial aid, sending medical and disaster response experts, increasing the number of Ebola treatment units and safe burial teams, deploying mobile testing labs, providing test kits and medical supplies, delivering community care kits and nutritional support, and offering technical support. The U.S. will continue to scale up its presence in West Africa, oversee the construction of Ebola treatment units, train healthcare providers, establish a hospital for healthcare workers, and leverage a regional staging base in Senegal. Domestically, the U.S. has prepared its healthcare system to respond to Ebola cases by enhancing surveillance and laboratory testing capacity, authorizing the use of diagnostic tests, providing guidance and tools for hospitals and healthcare providers, developing guidance for health departments, disseminating information to the public, advancing the development of vaccines and antivirals, monitoring for fraudulent products, and issuing emergency special permits for waste disposal. The U.S. has also implemented screening measures for outbound passengers in West Africa and upon arrival in the U.S., including travel health questionnaires, visual assessments, body temperature measurement, secondary screenings for suspected cases, and training for airport employees and customs personnel.
