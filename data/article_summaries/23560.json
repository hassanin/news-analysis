The United States is expressing concern over the Turkish government's decision to block its citizens' access to communication tools, such as Twitter. This restriction undermines the people's freedom of expression and association, as well as the principles of open governance and universal rights. The US has conveyed its concerns to the Turkish government and urges them to respect freedom of the press and restore full access to these blocked technologies.
