President Donald Trump has issued an Executive Order declaring a national emergency with regards to the situation in Mali. The order is based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the National Emergencies Act, and other relevant legislation. The security situation in Mali has deteriorated over the past year, with violations of ceasefire arrangements, expansion of terrorist activities, drug trafficking, human rights abuses, and attacks against civilians and security forces. The United States has supported the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), but the overall security situation has worsened and little progress has been made in implementing the 2015 Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation. The Executive Order aims to demonstrate US support for bringing peace to Mali and discouraging obstruction of the 2015 agreement.
