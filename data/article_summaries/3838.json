The Biden-Harris Administration has released the National Cybersecurity Strategy Implementation Plan (NCSIP), which outlines more than 65 high-impact Federal initiatives to address cybersecurity challenges. The plan focuses on various pillars, including defending critical infrastructure, disrupting and dismantling threat actors, shaping market forces, investing in a resilient future, and forging international partnerships. The plan assigns responsible agencies for each initiative and sets timelines for completion. The Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) will coordinate activities under the plan and provide annual reports on its implementation. The Administration emphasizes the importance of collaboration with the private sector, civil society, international partners, Congress, and state and local governments. The NCSIP is a living document that will be updated annually.
