This article is about Executive Order 13583, which was issued by President Barack Obama in August 2011. The order establishes a coordinated government-wide initiative to promote diversity and inclusion in the federal workforce. The order states that the federal government should strive to achieve a workforce that represents all segments of society. It emphasizes the importance of diversity and inclusion in the federal government as an employer, and highlights the need for a diverse and qualified workforce. The order directs executive departments and agencies to develop and implement a comprehensive, integrated, and strategic focus on diversity and inclusion as part of their human resources strategies. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the President's Management Council (PMC), and the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) are tasked with establishing a government-wide diversity and inclusion initiative and strategic plan. The order also outlines the responsibilities of executive departments and agencies in implementing the government-wide plan and developing agency-specific diversity and inclusion strategic plans. The order does not affect the authority of departments and agencies or the functions of the Director of OMB, and it is subject to applicable law and the availability of appropriations.
