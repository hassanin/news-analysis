Various individuals in the defense industry and security experts have expressed their support for the Trump Administration's efforts to address China's theft of intellectual property. They argue that China's actions not only harm the U.S. economy but also undermine national security. The theft of intellectual property has cost millions of jobs and weakened U.S. industries, including the defense industry. These individuals highlight the need to protect American innovation and ensure that the military can benefit from private sector innovation. They welcome the administration's investigation into this issue and call for more action to be taken to address China's attempts to undermine U.S. economic and national security interests.
