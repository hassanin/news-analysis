President Joe Biden's leadership, along with the efforts of Majority Leader Schumer and Speaker Pelosi, has led to the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act. This legislation aims to lower prescription drug costs for seniors and reduce health insurance premiums for 13 million Americans. It also includes the largest investment in addressing the climate crisis, which will create jobs in wind, solar, and electric vehicle manufacturing. Additionally, it aims to lower energy bills for working families and support environmental justice. The legislation is fully funded by ensuring that the wealthiest corporations pay their fair share. However, no Republicans in Congress voted for the package, despite its benefits for millions of Americans. Over the past 18 months, the Biden administration has created nearly ten million jobs, assisted small businesses, improved infrastructure, and expanded access to high-speed internet. While there is still work to be done, the achievements so far demonstrate the determination of the American people and the vision of the Biden administration to address current challenges and build a prosperous future for America.
