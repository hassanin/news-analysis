The article discusses the U.S.-Brazil Strategic Energy Dialogue (SED) and the progress made in various areas of cooperation between the two countries. The SED aims to develop safe, secure, and affordable energy supplies for economic growth, energy security, and the transition to a clean energy economy. The priority areas of cooperation include oil and natural gas, biofuels, clean energy and efficiency, hydropower and wind energy, energy efficiency, smart grid technology, science, and nuclear energy.

In the area of oil and natural gas, the United States and Brazil have been exchanging information and best practices through technical workshops and events involving government regulators and private industry. They will continue collaborative activities in 2012, including workshops on offshore safety, spill response, and shale gas development.

In terms of biofuels, the two countries are engaged in bilateral research and development activities, standards cooperation, and joint work with other nations. They are also working on sustainable aviation biofuels and providing technical assistance to other countries in strengthening their biofuels policies and capabilities.

Hydropower and wind energy have been identified as strategic areas for increased partnership. The two countries will work together through the Sustainable Development of Hydropower Initiative, and stakeholders will explore the technical aspects and market opportunities of distributed and community wind development in Brazil.

Energy efficiency is another focus area, with the aim of achieving major efficiency gains through effective public policies and compatible standards in the building and industrial sectors. The two countries have already convened workshops and are exploring opportunities for partnerships in this area.

Smart grid technology deployment is being pursued, and both countries are working to identify opportunities for greater private-sector partnerships. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency has an active program in Brazil, including funding for a smart grid pilot implementation strategy.

In the field of science, Brazil and the United States are cooperating on the Green Ocean Amazon 2014 experiment to gain a better understanding of the tropics' role in the Earth's climate. They are also planning to sign a Memorandum of Understanding to facilitate cooperation in earth sciences.

Regarding nuclear energy, technical and regulatory agencies from both countries are collaborating to ensure the safe and responsible generation of nuclear power for peaceful purposes. They have held workshops and are exploring areas for technical cooperation, including site selection, licensing, reactor sustainability, and nuclear security and nonproliferation activities.

Overall, the U.S.-Brazil Strategic Energy Dialogue aims to strengthen the energy relationship between the two countries, increase bilateral trade in energy-related goods and services, enhance national and shared energy security, create jobs, and address the challenge of global climate change.
