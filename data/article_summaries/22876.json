President Obama has signed a disaster declaration for the State of Iowa, authorizing federal aid to assist in recovery efforts after severe storms and flooding from September 21 to October 3, 2016. The declaration allows for federal funding to be provided to state and local governments, as well as certain nonprofit organizations, for emergency work and repair or replacement of damaged facilities. The funding will be provided on a cost-sharing basis. Additionally, hazard mitigation measures statewide will also be eligible for federal funding. James N. Russo has been named as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Further designations may be made if requested by the state and based on damage assessments. For more information, the media can contact the FEMA News Desk.
