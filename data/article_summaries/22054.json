Senator John Kerry expresses his support for President Obama's proposal to provide tax cuts for every American. Kerry states that he has consistently opposed the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy and believes they did not create jobs but instead contributed to a large deficit. He acknowledges that President Obama faced challenges in the Senate, with all 42 Senate Republicans voting to hold middle-class tax cuts and unemployment insurance hostage, while the Democratic caucus was not unified. Despite the difficult situation, Kerry believes that the President made a tough decision to compromise in order to extend unemployment benefits, middle-class tax cuts, and Recovery Act provisions, even though he opposes the tax extensions for the wealthy. Kerry emphasizes that the fight over tax breaks for the wealthy will be revisited in two years. He acknowledges that it was a steep price to pay, but highlights the importance of not cutting off unemployment benefits for those in need and securing middle-class benefits that would otherwise not be possible. Kerry concludes by stating that the President achieved many things that they have been fighting for but have not yet won in any other way.
