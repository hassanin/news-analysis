Elouise Cobell, a Native American activist, passed away, and President Obama expressed his sadness over her death. Cobell was instrumental in exposing the Interior Department's failure to account for billions of dollars owed to Native Americans. As a result of her efforts, a legislation was passed that provided justice to those affected and established a scholarship fund for Native Americans to access higher education. Cobell also played a role in strengthening the government-to-government relationship with Indian Country. The President extended his condolences to Cobell's family and those mourning her loss.
