Ten years ago, the Assad regime carried out a horrific chemical attack on the Damascus suburb of Ghouta, resulting in the deaths of over 1,400 people, including many children. The images from that day continue to haunt us and motivate efforts to eliminate chemical weapons and ensure a safer future for Syrians. This article emphasizes the need for no child, in Syria or anywhere else, to live in fear of such weapons. The international community is committed to verifying the complete elimination of Syria's chemical weapons program and documenting violations of international law and human rights in the country. The Assad regime, supported by Russia, is accused of attempting to make the world forget the atrocities in Syria, but this will not be allowed to happen. Syria and Russia are urged to fulfill their international obligations and stop obstructing the work of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The global community will continue to seek justice for the victims and survivors of the atrocities in Syria and hold those responsible accountable.
