The U.S. is utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) in various ways to combat the novel coronavirus. AI is being used in American laboratories to discover new therapeutics, and the Food and Drug Administration has approved an AI tool to aid in the detection of coronavirus in CT scans. Additionally, the White House has spearheaded an initiative to create a database of over 128,000 articles that scientists can analyze using AI to gain a better understanding of the virus and develop treatments.

However, AI is also being misused by authoritarian regimes. The Chinese Communist Party, for example, reportedly employs AI to identify and punish individuals who criticize the regime's pandemic response. They have also implemented a coronavirus social-credit score system, assigning color codes to determine who can freely go out and who will be forced into quarantine.

As the world moves towards recovery from the pandemic, nations face a crucial decision regarding the future of AI. The Group of Seven (G-7) nations, meeting under the U.S. presidency, have the opportunity to shape the evolution of AI in a manner that respects fundamental rights and upholds shared values. To this end, G-7 technology ministers will launch the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) in collaboration with other democratic countries.
