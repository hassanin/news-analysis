On March 23, 2018, President Donald Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum concerning military service by transgender individuals. The memorandum revokes a previous memorandum from August 25, 2017, and any other directives related to military service by transgender individuals. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, submitted a memorandum and report setting forth the policies on this issue that the Secretary of Defense has concluded should be adopted by the Department of Defense. The policies state that transgender individuals with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria, who may require substantial medical treatment, are disqualified from military service except under certain limited circumstances. The Secretary of Homeland Security concurs with these policies with respect to the U.S. Coast Guard. The memorandum does not impair the authority granted by law to executive departments or agencies, nor does it create any right or benefit enforceable by any party against the United States or its entities. The Secretary of Defense is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.
