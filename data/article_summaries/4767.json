The Biden-Harris Administration has announced new efforts to ensure that all Americans have access to the good jobs created by the President's Investing in America agenda. These efforts include initiatives to provide training and education that lead to high-quality careers, regardless of whether individuals go to college. Private companies have already announced $470 billion in manufacturing and clean energy investments, in addition to the $220 billion already announced by the Administration for infrastructure projects. The Administration aims to ensure that American workers and families have access to these job opportunities and the necessary training and skills. The Department of Labor will support local leaders and communities in driving workforce development efforts, and the Administration has identified five Workforce Hubs focused on key industries. The Administration is also launching a new sprint in advanced manufacturing, partnering with employers and stakeholders to expand pre-apprenticeships, Registered Apprenticeships, and career and technical education programs. Additionally, the Department of Labor is launching the Good Jobs, Great Cities Academy, which will provide technical assistance to cities to develop workforce initiatives in infrastructure, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing.
