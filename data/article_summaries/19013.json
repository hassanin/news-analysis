In this article, President Barack Obama issues a presidential memorandum to the Secretary of State, suspending the limitations set forth in the Jerusalem Embassy Act for a period of 6 months. The Act, passed in 1995, called for the relocation of the United States Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. However, President Obama determines that it is necessary to suspend these limitations in order to protect the national security interests of the United States. The memorandum directs the Secretary of State to transmit this determination to Congress and publish it in the Federal Register.
