The White House has announced new proposals to strengthen working families in America. These proposals include calling on Congress, as well as states and cities, to pass legislation that would allow working Americans to earn up to seven days of paid sick time per year. The President is also proposing more than $2 billion in new funds to encourage states to develop paid family and medical leave programs, and the Department of Labor will use $1 million in existing funds to help states and municipalities conduct feasibility studies. Additionally, the President is signing a Presidential Memorandum to advance up to six weeks of paid sick leave for parents with a new child and is calling on Congress to pass legislation giving federal employees an additional six weeks of paid parental leave. The President's proposals aim to address the challenges faced by working families in balancing work and family responsibilities, and to provide support for both employers and employees. The proposals also highlight the need to expand access to earned sick days and paid family and medical leave, and to modernize federal workplace policies to better support working families.
