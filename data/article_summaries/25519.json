The Trump Administration has established the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office to further accelerate efforts to ensure America's leadership in AI. The office will oversee and implement the United States' national AI strategy and serve as a central hub for coordination and collaboration in AI research and policymaking across the government, private sector, academia, and other stakeholders. This initiative is in accordance with the recently passed National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Act of 2020, which expands existing AI policies and initiatives. The bipartisan Industries of the Future Act also requires a plan to double federal AI research and development investment. The establishment of the National AI Initiative Office recognizes the United States' position as a world leader in artificial intelligence and aims to maintain this leadership position in the future.
