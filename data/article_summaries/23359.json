In this press briefing, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs discusses the situation in Egypt and the US government's stance on the matter. He explains that the US does not determine when the grievances of the Egyptian people have been met by the Egyptian government, but believes that there must be an orderly transition that includes negotiations with a broad cross-section of the Egyptian people, including opposition groups. He emphasizes that the US does not determine who is on the ballot in Egypt and that the focus should be on free and fair elections and constitutional changes that facilitate a more open and democratic process. Gibbs also addresses concerns about the Muslim Brotherhood gaining power and emphasizes the importance of non-violence and adherence to the law in the democratic process. He mentions that the US is closely monitoring the situation and the potential impact on financial and commodity markets. Gibbs also discusses the role of US Ambassador Jon Huntsman and the potential for his departure. He reiterates the US government's commitment to equality and justice and the end of the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy.
