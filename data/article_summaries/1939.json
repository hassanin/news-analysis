In a press conference, President Biden addressed the recent Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, stating that it was a "terrible, extreme, and...wrongheaded" decision. He emphasized that the decision was not driven by the Constitution or historical facts but by a deep antipathy towards Roe and the right to privacy. President Biden called on Americans to vote for pro-choice candidates in order to restore and protect reproductive rights. He also announced an executive order to protect women's reproductive rights and access to healthcare services, including emergency care, contraception, and privacy. He criticized the extreme laws being enacted in some states and vowed to veto any national ban on abortion. President Biden also commented on the recent death of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and stated that he did not believe it would have a profound destabilizing impact on Japanese security. He also mentioned that he had not made a decision yet on lifting China tariffs and that they were being reviewed one at a time.
