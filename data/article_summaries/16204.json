This article is a fact sheet released by the White House Office of the Press Secretary in March 2011. It outlines the Obama administration's actions and policies regarding the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. The four-part approach includes bringing detainees to justice through federal civilian courts or reformed military commissions, complying with court-ordered releases, transferring detainees from Guantanamo when possible, and holding individuals in lawful military detention when no other options are available. The article discusses the resumption of military commissions and the establishment of a periodic review process for detainees who have not been charged, convicted, or designated for transfer. It also addresses the administration's commitment to Article III trials in federal courts and opposition to restrictions imposed by Congress. The article concludes by expressing support for a strong international legal framework, specifically mentioning Additional Protocol II and Article 75 of Additional Protocol I to the 1949 Geneva Conventions.
