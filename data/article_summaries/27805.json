On October 26, 2020, President Donald Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum certifying that the Government of Sudan has taken demonstrable steps in accordance with the Comprehensive Peace in Sudan Act of 2004 and the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006. The certification states that the Sudanese government has ensured that its armed forces and associated militias are not committing atrocities or obstructing human rights monitors or humanitarian assistance. It also mentions the demobilization and disarmament of militias supported or created by the Sudanese government, allowing full and unfettered humanitarian assistance to all regions of Sudan, including Darfur, and cooperating with international commissions of inquiry to investigate atrocities and violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. The certification further highlights the importance of cooperation with the African Union, the United Nations, and other observer, monitoring, and protection missions, as well as facilitating the safe and voluntary return of displaced persons and refugees. Finally, the certification calls for the implementation of final agreements reached in the Naivasha peace process and the installation of a new coalition government based on the Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase of Peace in the Sudan signed on June 5, 2004. The Secretary of State is directed to publish this Certification in the Federal Register, along with the accompanying Memorandum of Justification.
