The Biden-Harris Administration has launched an effort to reform the US immigration system, focusing on creating a new system to manage and secure the border, provide a pathway to citizenship, and better manage migration. Progress has been made in processing individuals returned to Mexico, expanding lawful pathways for protection, strengthening collaboration with regional partners, and deterring irregular migration. The administration is releasing a blueprint outlining the next steps to implement a fair and humane immigration system. This includes ensuring a secure and well-managed border, implementing orderly and fair processing of asylum applications, strengthening collaboration with regional partners, and investing in Central America to address the root causes of migration. While the administration can make significant changes through executive authority, Congress must also take action. The public supports a path to citizenship and a fair legal immigration system. Congress should pass legislation to address the root causes of migration in Central America and implement a collaborative migration management strategy.
