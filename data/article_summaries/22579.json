This article discusses the efforts and progress made by the Obama Administration in HIV/AIDS prevention. It highlights various breakthroughs in prevention efforts, including the discovery that treatment of people living with HIV reduces the risk of transmission, the effectiveness of certain HIV medications in reducing risk, the discovery of an effective microbicide for women, and the approval of a rapid home HIV test kit. The article also mentions the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, which focuses on reducing new HIV infections, increasing access to care, reducing health disparities, and achieving a coordinated response to the epidemic. On the global front, the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is leading in implementing prevention activities, such as antiretroviral treatment, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, and voluntary medical male circumcision. The article emphasizes the importance of HIV testing, condom use, treatment as prevention, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, voluntary medical male circumcision, prevention programs for high-risk populations, substance abuse treatment, and access to sterile syringes. It also mentions pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and high-impact prevention for key populations. The article concludes by discussing future plans to increase cost efficiency and expand prevention services, including reaching HIV-positive pregnant women, distributing condoms, supporting voluntary medical male circumcisions, and expanding the use of rapid test kits for HIV testing.
