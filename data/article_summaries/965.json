The senior administration officials provided a preview of the Global COVID Summit that the United States will cohost. The summit aims to redouble efforts to control COVID-19 and ensure preparedness for future pandemics. The United States has delivered over 500 million vaccine doses to over 100 countries and committed over $19 billion in funding for COVID-19 response. The summit will focus on securing new resources and policy commitments to control COVID-19 in 2022, getting vaccines, tests, and treatments to vulnerable populations, and preventing future variants and pandemics. Several world leaders and heads of state will speak at the summit, and Vice President Harris will give remarks. The United States is calling on Congress to provide emergency funding to continue the COVID-19 response. The summit has already leveraged over $3.1 billion in commitments, and the United States will provide additional funding for the Global Health Security and Pandemic Preparedness fund at the World Bank. The United States is also licensing COVID-19 research tools and vaccine candidates to the Medicines Patent Pool and piloting test-and-treat strategies in low- and middle-income countries. The senior administration officials emphasized the importance of congressional action to secure additional funding and urged other countries to step up their efforts in the global fight against COVID-19.
