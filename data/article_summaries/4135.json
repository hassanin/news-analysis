President Biden has announced two new judicial nominees who are highly qualified and committed to upholding the rule of law and the Constitution. These nominations align with the President's goal of creating a diverse judiciary in terms of personal and professional backgrounds. One of the nominees, Andre B. Mathis, would become the first Black man from Tennessee to sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in 24 years. Mathis is currently a partner at the law firm Butler Snow LLP and has experience in commercial and government litigation, criminal defense work, and representing indigent criminal defendants. He has also been involved in pro bono litigation with the Tennessee Innocence Project and has served on various legal committees and boards. The other nominee, Judge Alison J. Nathan, would be the second openly LGBT woman to serve on any federal circuit court. She has been a United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of New York since 2011 and has previously worked in the White House Counsel's Office and as Special Counsel to the Solicitor General of New York. Judge Nathan has also served as a law clerk for a United States Supreme Court Justice and a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Both nominees have impressive educational backgrounds, with Mathis receiving his J.D. from the University of Memphis and Nathan receiving her J.D. from Cornell Law School. These nominations bring the total number of announced federal judicial nominees by President Biden to 64, reflecting his commitment to filling judicial vacancies promptly.
