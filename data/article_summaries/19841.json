This memorandum, issued by President Barack Obama on December 22, 2010, announces a two-year freeze in the pay of civilian federal employees. The freeze is intended to address the nation's fiscal challenges and put the country on a sound financial footing. The freeze is included in the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, 2011, which was signed into law. The memorandum also states that agency heads should not provide any upward adjustments in federal employees' pay schedules or rates during the two-year period covered by the freeze. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management is directed to issue guidance on implementing the memorandum and publish it in the Federal Register.
