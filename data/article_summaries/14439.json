In this letter, President Barack Obama responds to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, expressing his agreement on the importance of minimizing regulatory burdens and costs. He mentions Executive Order 13563, which aims to reduce regulatory burdens and costs, and highlights the completion of a Government-wide review of existing rules, resulting in reform plans from 26 agencies that are expected to save over $10 billion in the next five years. The President also defends the costs of final rules, stating that the benefits outweighed the costs in previous years. He explains that the regulatory agenda is a list of rules under consideration, subject to various constraints and requirements before they can be issued. The President assures that all rules, including expensive ones, are carefully scrutinized for conformity to the law and Executive Order 13563. He provides a list of seven proposed rules with estimated annual costs exceeding $1 billion and expresses his commitment to working with the Speaker to create a regulatory system that promotes public health, safety, economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation.
