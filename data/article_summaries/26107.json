The article discusses the ongoing debate over healthcare in America, emphasizing the need for action due to the burdens and failures of Obamacare. The author, Secretary Rick Perry, highlights the rising costs and limited options for consumers, as well as the loss of choices, doctors, and insurance plans. Perry believes that the proposed reforms to Medicaid in the Better Care Reconciliation Act would give states more control to deliver better care at lower costs. He argues that there is an historic opportunity for Congress to empower people and states, and move control out of Washington. Perry concludes by stating that repealing Obamacare is not enough, and that focus should be placed on returning healthcare to states, individuals, and healthcare professionals.
