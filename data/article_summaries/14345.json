President Barack Obama has proclaimed March 18 to March 24, 2012, as National Poison Prevention Week. The proclamation aims to raise awareness about unintentional drug overdose, exposure to harmful chemicals, and other types of accidental poisoning that claim thousands of lives each year. The President encourages Americans to protect their loved ones by identifying poisoning hazards at home, using, storing, and disposing of medication safely and effectively, and learning more about how to prevent and respond to poison emergencies. The proclamation also emphasizes the need to educate parents, young people, patients, and prescribers about the dangers of prescription drug abuse and steps they can take to prevent it. The national poison help hotline, available at 1-800-222-1222, is highlighted as a resource for responding to poison emergencies and providing essential information. The proclamation concludes by calling upon all Americans to observe National Poison Prevention Week by taking actions to protect their families from hazardous household materials and misuse of prescription medications.
