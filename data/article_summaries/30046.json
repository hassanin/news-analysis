During a press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders announced the appointment of Johnny C. Taylor Jr. as the new Chairman of the Board of Advisors for the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities. She also highlighted the historic obstruction by Senate Democrats in confirming nominees, with 73 fewer confirmations than the previous administration. Sanders criticized Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for delaying the confirmation of nominees, including Ric Grenell, the President's nominee for Ambassador to Germany. Sanders also mentioned that 11-year-old Natalie Dalton and her 8-year-old cousin Celia will be visiting the White House on March 23rd to work with the White House kitchen staff. During the Q&A session, Sanders addressed questions about the President's authority to confront Russian cyber intrusion, the ongoing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election, the President's support for raising the minimum age to buy a long gun, and the President's position on universal background checks for gun purchases. Sanders also mentioned that the President will be meeting with bipartisan lawmakers to discuss immigration and school safety, and that the White House will be announcing specific policy proposals on school safety later in the week.
