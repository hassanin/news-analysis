The Biden Administration is urging Congress to provide funding for the nation's COVID-19 response, emphasizing the dire consequences of their inaction. Without funding, there will be a shortage of vaccines, treatments, and tests for Americans, as well as fewer shots administered globally. The administration has utilized the resources provided by Congress to make significant progress in fighting the virus, including saving over 2 million American lives, reopening schools, creating jobs, and reducing healthcare costs. The President's National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan aims to ensure the availability of vaccines and treatments, prepare for surges and new variants, and vaccinate more people worldwide. However, without financial support, the United States will be ill-prepared for future challenges. The administration emphasizes the urgency of Congress taking action to save lives and maintain preparedness.
