President Donald Trump has sent a notice to Congress stating that the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans will continue beyond June 26, 2019. The threat posed by extremist violence and obstructionist activity in the region has not been resolved and continues to pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Therefore, President Trump has determined it is necessary to continue the national emergency.
