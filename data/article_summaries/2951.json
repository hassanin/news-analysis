President Biden has issued an order to address the aftermath of a train derailment carrying hazardous materials in East Palestine, Ohio. The train derailed on February 3, 2023, causing a fire and the release of hazardous substances into local waterways. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been leading cleanup efforts and monitoring air and water quality in the affected areas. The Department of Transportation (DOT) is investigating the causes of the derailment and assessing Norfolk Southern's compliance with safety regulations. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have also provided support and assistance. The order directs various federal agencies to use their authorities and resources to hold Norfolk Southern accountable and provide additional assistance to the affected communities. It also establishes a Federal Disaster Recovery Coordinator to oversee long-term recovery efforts and assess unmet needs. The EPA will continue to oversee the cleanup and monitoring efforts, while the HHS will monitor public health consequences and provide technical assistance to the affected states. The DOT will provide a report on their actions, and if necessary, new authorities will be identified. The order does not affect existing authorities or create any new rights or benefits enforceable against the United States.
