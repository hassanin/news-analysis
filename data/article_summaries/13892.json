President Barack Obama has proclaimed August 21-27, 2016, as National Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve Week. This week is dedicated to recognizing the important role played by the families, employers, and communities of the National Guard and Reserve members in supporting them to serve the country when needed. There are over one million members of the National Guard and Reserve who train and prepare throughout the year to serve the nation. These citizen-Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen deserve the full backing of their civilian employers and the promise of a secure and stable life at home. The Joining Forces initiative led by First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden has worked to support military spouses and veterans in finding employment. The administration has also encouraged communities to hire veterans and match members of the Guard and Reserve to suitable jobs. During this week, Americans are called upon to express their gratitude to the members of the National Guard and Reserve and their civilian employers. State and local officials, private organizations, and military commanders are also urged to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
