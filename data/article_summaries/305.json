President Biden has announced additional air travel restrictions from South Africa and seven other countries as a precautionary measure against the Omicron variant of COVID-19. He urges Americans who are fully vaccinated to get a booster shot for stronger protection, and encourages those who are not yet vaccinated to get vaccinated. The President emphasizes the importance of global vaccinations and calls on other countries to match the United States' efforts in donating vaccines. He also urges the World Trade Organization to waive intellectual property protections for COVID vaccines to enable global manufacturing.
