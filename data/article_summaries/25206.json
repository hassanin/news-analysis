President Donald Trump has announced that he is vetoing the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. In a statement, he outlined several reasons for his decision, including the Act's failure to include critical national security measures, provisions that he believes disrespect veterans and military history, and its contradiction of his "America first" foreign policy. He also criticized the Act for not making meaningful changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which he believes facilitates the spread of foreign disinformation online. Additionally, President Trump objected to the Act's requirement to rename certain military installations, its restriction on the President's ability to respond to national emergencies, and its interference with his efforts to bring troops home from Afghanistan, Germany, and South Korea. He concluded by stating that he cannot support the bill and will return it to the House of Representatives without his approval.
