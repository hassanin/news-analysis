Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump's nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court, is set to begin confirmation hearings before the Senate. Kavanaugh is described as one of the most qualified nominees in generations and is seen as a mainstream, experienced judge who will respect precedent. He has served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit for over a decade and has authored over 300 judicial opinions. Kavanaugh's nomination process has been transparent and thorough, with his selection made from a public list of top-rated legal minds in the country. He is known for his intellect, persuasiveness, and ability to build consensus, and believes that a judge's role is to interpret the law rather than make policy.
