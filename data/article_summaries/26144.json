Second Lady Karen Pence visited various historical sites in Amman, Jordan, including The Citadel and the Roman Amphitheater. She then participated in an art therapy discussion and learned that art therapy is an emerging profession in Jordan with few professionally trained art therapists. Mrs. Pence later had tea with Queen Rania Al Abdullah and attended a working lunch with the King of Jordan and the Vice President. Mrs. Pence's chosen initiative is art therapy, which she calls "Art Therapy: Healing with the HeART." Art therapy is an integrative mental health profession that uses art-making and creative processes to enrich the lives of individuals, families, and communities.
