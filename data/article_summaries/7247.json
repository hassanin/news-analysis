Vice President Kamala Harris visited the Upper San Leandro Water Treatment Plant in Oakland, California to discuss the importance of water as a precious resource and the need to address the distribution and access to clean drinking water. She emphasized that wars may be fought over water in the future and highlighted the American Jobs Plan's focus on water infrastructure, including water capture, storage, recycling, conservation, and desalination. Harris also emphasized the importance of water equity and the need to provide grants and support to homeowners to upgrade their systems for public health purposes. She mentioned specific areas, such as Iowa, Flint, and the Mississippi Delta, where children are drinking toxic water and the need to address lead and PFAS contamination.
