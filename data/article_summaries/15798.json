The article discusses a determination made by the President regarding the supply of petroleum and petroleum products from countries other than Iran. The analysis shows that oil markets have been loosening in recent months due to production increases in other countries, particularly the United States, and weak global demand growth. This has led to a substantial increase in global surplus crude oil production capacity and an increase in global crude oil inventories. As a result, the price of crude oil has dropped to its lowest level in four years. Despite these market conditions, the United States has committed to pausing efforts to further reduce Iran's crude oil sales during the period of the Joint Plan of Action between the P5+1 and Iran. In return for this and other limited relief measures, Iran has taken steps to halt and roll back progress on its nuclear program, which has been verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
