President Donald Trump has signed into law the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018, which aims to review and release records of criminal investigations related to alleged civil rights violations between 1940 and 1980. However, Trump raises several constitutional concerns with the Act. He argues that certain sections could compel the disclosure of material covered by executive privilege, and that exceptions should be made to protect the integrity of law enforcement processes and the confidentiality of deliberative material. Trump also expresses concerns about the provisions granting authority to the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board, and the qualifications and removal restrictions for its members. He states that he will interpret these provisions in line with his constitutional authority. Finally, Trump notes that the Act does not provide funding for its implementation and encourages Congress to appropriate funds for this purpose.
