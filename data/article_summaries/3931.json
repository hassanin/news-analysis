The Biden-Harris Administration has launched the Apprenticeship Ambassador Initiative, a network of over 200 employers, organizations, educators, and community-based groups committed to strengthening and diversifying Registered Apprenticeship. This initiative aims to provide a high-quality, debt-free, earn-and-learn model that helps employers hire a more diverse workforce and offers workers on-the-job learning and mentorship opportunities. The Ambassadors have committed to developing 460 new apprenticeship programs, hiring over 10,000 apprentices, and organizing 5,000 outreach and training events. They will also focus on expanding access to underserved populations. This initiative builds on President Biden's efforts to expand apprenticeships, which have already resulted in the development of 4,000 new programs and the hiring of over one million apprentices. The initiative will benefit both workers and employers economically, with 93% of apprentices gaining employment and earning an average starting wage of $77,000. Employers also benefit from a $1.47 return for every dollar spent on apprenticeships. The initiative aligns with the President's economic agenda, including addressing supply chain challenges, clean energy jobs, infrastructure jobs, and other high-demand sectors. The Department of Labor, Commerce, and Education are also taking steps to expand apprenticeships and serve at least one million apprentices annually within the next five years.
