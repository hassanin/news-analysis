During a press briefing aboard Air Force One, a senior administration official discussed the executive order (EO) signed by President Trump to review the H-1B visa program. The official stated that the lottery system currently used in the program has no regard for skill, wages, or salary. The administration is asking agencies to consider alternatives to the lottery system that take into consideration these factors. One potential alternative is to raise the fees or wages paid to H-1B workers, which would exclude those who are paid well below the market wage. The official also addressed criticism that the EO is not demanding immediate action, stating that an executive order is the most muscular action that can be taken administratively and that agencies are now accountable to the President for their decisions regarding H-1B visa waivers. The official emphasized the administration's focus on promoting job opportunities and higher wages for American workers.
