This article is a notice from the White House Office of the Press Secretary, stating that the President has decided to continue the national emergency with respect to the Western Balkans. The national emergency was originally declared in 2001, due to the threat posed by extremist violence in the Republic of Macedonia and obstruction of the Dayton Accords in Bosnia and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 relating to Kosovo. The President has determined that the actions of individuals threatening peace and international stabilization efforts in the Western Balkans still pose a threat to national security and foreign policy. Therefore, the national emergency will continue for another year.
