The article is a message from the White House Office of the Press Secretary regarding the continuation of the national emergency with respect to Belarus. The President has sent a notice to Congress stating that the emergency, which was declared in 2006, is to continue beyond June 16, 2015. The actions and policies of certain members of the Belarusian government and others to undermine democratic processes, commit human rights abuses, and engage in corruption pose a threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.
