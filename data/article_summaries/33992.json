Men's Health Week is an opportunity for men in the United States to educate themselves about the symptoms and warning signs of diseases that affect them and to commit to leading healthier lifestyles. Heart disease and depression are two major health challenges for American men, with nearly 1 in 13 adult men living with heart disease and approximately 1 in 10 men experiencing depression or anxiety. Men are also less likely than women to visit healthcare providers or receive annual health exams. It is important to remove stigmas around seeking mental health treatment and encourage men to reduce stress, be more physically active, and improve their diets. The administration is working to ensure that healthcare costs do not burden American families by tackling surprise medical billing, expediting generic and innovator drug approvals, and increasing transparency in healthcare and drug pricing. Surprise billing occurs when patients receive care from out-of-network providers they assumed were in-network or when they select an in-network option but receive care from an out-of-network provider. To address this issue, the administration has sent principles to Congress to guide legislation that will limit surprise medical billing. The administration is also working to drive down drug costs by removing red tape at the FDA that slows generic drug approval, which has already saved Americans $26 billion. Through improved competition and price negotiations, the administration aims to achieve real reform on drug pricing. Transparency in healthcare costs will help Americans avoid unexpected and unjustified charges during their recovery. During Men's Health Week, men are encouraged to make healthy changes in their lifestyles to reduce the risks of common illnesses and diseases.
