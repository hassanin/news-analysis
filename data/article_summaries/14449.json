President Barack Obama has proclaimed the week of October 12 to October 18, 2014, as National School Lunch Week in the United States. The proclamation emphasizes the importance of providing balanced and healthy meals to young people, as more than 30 million children rely on the National School Lunch Program for daily nutrition. The School Breakfast Program also ensures that over 13 million children start their school day with a full stomach. These programs are often the only regular source of food for many students. The proclamation encourages schools to expand access to nutritious food options and acknowledges the efforts of those working in school cafeterias and food preparation centers. It also highlights the need to improve the quality and nutritional value of school meals, particularly in light of the high rates of obesity and related health conditions among American children. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, signed by President Obama in 2010, raised nutritional standards and increased access to healthy meals. First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move! initiative has also played a role in promoting nutrition and healthy lifestyles in schools. The proclamation concludes by urging all Americans to support activities that promote the health and well-being of the nation's children.
