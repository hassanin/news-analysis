The United States and Turkey have agreed to a ceasefire in Syria, following Turkish forces crossing into the country one week ago. The ceasefire will last for 120 hours and will allow for the withdrawal of YPG forces from the safe zone. All military operations under Operation Peace Spring will be paused, and the operation will be halted entirely once the withdrawal is complete. The United States and Turkey have also committed to a peaceful resolution and future for the safe zone. Both countries have agreed to prioritize respecting vulnerable human life, human rights, and the protection of religious and ethnic communities in the region. The United States will work with Turkey and other nations to ensure peace and stability in the safe zone. The agreement also includes a commitment to defeat ISIS activities in northeast Syria and to coordinate efforts on detention facilities and internally displaced persons in formerly ISIS-controlled areas. President Trump and President Erdogan were both praised for their leadership and cooperation in achieving the ceasefire.
