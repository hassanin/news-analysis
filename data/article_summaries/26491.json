This executive order, issued by President Donald Trump on June 26, 2020, focuses on modernizing and reforming civil service hiring in the United States government. The order emphasizes the importance of skills- and competency-based hiring, rather than relying solely on college degrees, in order to ensure that the most capable individuals are hired for specific positions. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is directed to review and revise job classification and qualification standards within the competitive service, making changes available to the public within 120 days and in effect within 180 days. The order also calls for the improvement of assessments in the federal hiring process, with agencies assessing candidates based on relevant knowledge, skills, competencies, and abilities. Additionally, agencies are instructed to continually evaluate the effectiveness of different assessment strategies. The order provides definitions for key terms and includes general provisions to ensure its implementation is consistent with applicable law.
