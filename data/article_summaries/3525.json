President Biden spoke about the Build Back Better World (B3W) initiative at the United Nations General Assembly, which is an infrastructure partnership launched by the G7 leaders in June. The initiative aims to address the climate, health, and technology needs of developing countries through transparent and high-standard investments. To better understand the infrastructure needs in Latin America, Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics Daleep Singh led a delegation to Colombia, Ecuador, and Panama. The delegation met with government officials, private sector representatives, and civil society leaders to gather input on how to support local communities while upholding transparency, anticorruption measures, financial sustainability, labor protections, and environmental preservation. This visit reflects President Biden's commitment to strengthening ties with Latin America and addressing global infrastructure gaps exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. B3W focuses on climate, health, digital connectivity, gender equity, and recognizes the evolving infrastructure needs of countries. The United States plans to expand B3W and collaborate with various stakeholders to promote transparency, sustainability, and development impact in Latin America, the Caribbean, and other regions.
