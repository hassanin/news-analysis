President Obama has announced new investments to combat climate change and assist remote Alaskan communities. Alaska is warming twice as fast as the continental United States, and the impacts of climate change are already being felt in the state. The President's new commitments include: 
1. Building resilience in remote Alaskan communities by appointing a Federal coordinator and providing resources for short- and long-term solutions to address the impacts of climate change.
2. Addressing high energy costs by incentivizing clean energy and energy-efficiency solutions.
3. Releasing new climate data, maps, and tools to help communities understand and prepare for future climate change.
The President also announced grants for improving water systems in rural Alaska, support for tribal youth working on climate change projects, and the launch of Resilience AmeriCorps in Alaska. Additionally, there are new initiatives to expand access to clean energy solutions, such as launching a remote Alaskan Communities Energy Efficiency Competition and investing in biomimic clean energy. The President also announced a public-private partnership to achieve 99.7 percent clean energy on Kodiak Island. Finally, there are new efforts to release new climate data and tools, including mapping Alaska and the Arctic and expanding access to Arctic data and tools through the Climate Data Initiative and Climate Resilience Toolkit.
