First Lady Michelle Obama has two upcoming events. On Monday, June 29th, she will deliver remarks at MORE Magazine's MORE Impact Awards Luncheon. She will discuss the Let Girls Learn initiative and the importance of education for adolescent girls worldwide. The event will celebrate four women who have made significant contributions in the areas of women's and girls' rights, health, veterans and military families, and education. Peace Corps Director Carrie Hessler-Radelet will also speak at the event. On Tuesday, June 30th, the First Lady will host the first-ever White House Campout as part of the Let's Move! Outside initiative. The event is co-sponsored by the U.S. Department of the Interior and will take place on the White House South Lawn. Fifty fourth-grade Girl Scouts will participate in activities to earn the new Girls' Choice Outdoor badges, including rock wall climbing, knot tying, orienteering, and tent pitching. They will also have the opportunity to stargaze with NASA astronaut Cady Coleman. These events align with the Let's Move! Outside initiative, which encourages kids and families to enjoy the outdoors. Additionally, the First Lady serves as honorary co-chair for the centennial celebration of the National Park Service, and President Obama has launched the "Every Kid in a Park" initiative to inspire children to visit and enjoy America's federal lands and waters.
