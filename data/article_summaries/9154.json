Vice President Kamala Harris convened a meeting with over 20 Virginia state legislators and advocates who are fighting to protect reproductive rights. This meeting is part of a series of gatherings held in different states to discuss the importance of reproductive rights and the actions being taken to defend them. Harris thanked the leaders for their work in defending women's reproductive rights and spoke about the need to separate personal beliefs from government interference in women's decisions about their bodies. She also expressed concerns about other rights, such as the right to marry someone you love and access to contraception, that are also at risk. The participants discussed the intersection between the maternal health crisis and the healthcare crisis faced by women after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. They agreed to continue working together to defend reproductive healthcare in Virginia and across the nation.
